Well, hello! This is what my left eye looked like following a promenade during lunch, when something fell into my eye. No, it isn't drama in any sense of the word. I've no idea what it was, it didn't hurt as much as it stung me but what scared me was the fact that when I looked in the mirror when I came back from work, the eye had swollen a lot on one side, which looked extremely funny and felt weird. I couldn't look very far to the left as the swelling prevented me from doing so!

It's one thing when your body rebels, but to feel it rebelling _against yo_u is something different, especially when you feel it for the first time.

**GOD IT'S ME AND MY EYE FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST PICTURE WAS TAKEN!!!!!**

Oh ok, maybe not - it was The Return Of Dogge!

And to contrast Dogge - why, it's Blixa being scary yesterday evening!

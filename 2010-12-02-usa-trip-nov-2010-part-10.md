I've been home for a week and a half now, and it's...all about missing Austin.

I love that city. I even got used to driving around (with all my passengers scared) those streets: Cesar Chavez, Saba, 2nd East, et.c. The buildings. That tower nearby Ladybird Lake, the picnic area where we went. Magnolia Caf√©, I even think I'd find there from Patrick's place...

So many roads, so many people. I'm even more in love with Austin this time around. And it's little wonder. The city is truly a slice of heaven. Sure, sure, I haven't lived there. Yet. But I have friends there, who've lived in other parts of the country and really like it. Diversity, it's there. True, poverty is there, too, and just as Texas is a fucked-up state in its perverse ways, there are a load of great things about it too, a lot more great stuff to outweigh what's bad. And you can't ask for more from a city, I think.

There is such a wealth to the place.

And the people. I've yet to come across the simile of that, a feel of a community, even though it's all diverse.

Or maybe I've just lived in Stockholm too long. I don't think it's time to move on yet, but how far will yet stretch? That's rhetorical.

In short: I love my home town but by Bog, is Austin ever alluring.

Yet again, from “[_The Rap Year Book: The Most Important Rap Song From Every Year Since 1979, Discussed, Debated, and Deconstructed_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24795949-the-rap-year-book)“, this is all about **[Lil Wayne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Wayne)**'s masterpiece song "A Milli":

> Prior to recording Tha Carter in 2004, Wayne purged himself of all of the unused lyrics he had written down. He carried a notebook into a recording studio, clicked record, then rapped everything in the book until there was nothing left. He put it all on one thirty-five-minute song called “10,000 Bars.” That’s a slight simplification of the process, though only barely.
> 
> With no prepared lyrics, and with an idea not to write anything down anymore, Wayne changed everything. He still had the technical ability to rap, but in the absence of material to reference it became augmented: less burdened, more organic, weirder, more fun. He piled words and phrases up on top of each other, mushed together similes. He spent four mixtapes and twenty-five-thousand guest features practicing it. It was great, and unexpected, and enthralling. The only question was: Can he—can ANYONE—do anything like this on a proper album? And then “A Milli” popped. And it was perfect.
> 
> The beat was magical and feverish and instantly intimidating. Wayne’s lyrical sprint, his utter disregard for structure or linear compatibility, was intoxicating. Together, they were massive. 50 Cent was the first guy who showed that a big mixtape buzz could be swapped out for a major record deal. Wayne took that idea and advanced it. He showed it could do that, but that maybe that wasn’t the end goal anymore, because rap was heading in that direction now, heading toward a weirdo bonanza and mixtape-as-a-model sound, because that’s where he was taking it, and that’s where it’s been ever since. Perfect examples of what Lil Wayne set in motion are Gucci Mane’s “Lemonade” (2009) and Waka Flocka Flame’s “Hard in the Paint” (2010).
> 
> When the sales numbers for Tha Carter III were released, Wayne and his team were in Los Angeles. A celebration was ordered. Wayne never showed up. He spent the evening in the tiny recording studio on one of the buses they were traveling in. By the time the party was over, by the time the others had returned to the bus, he’d recorded three new songs. This is my second favorite Lil Wayne anecdote. My first is that Wayne wandered into a nightclub one evening not knowing he’d walked into a Stevie Wonder party and Stevie Wonder yelled at him for making too much noise. Stevie Wonder is the greatest.

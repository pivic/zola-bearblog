[![Bird in park](http://static.flickr.com/36/125601348_87a3b7e64e_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=125601348) It's nice to see Microsoft re-thinking authentication when it comes to e-mail. [This post](http://blogs.msdn.com/willkennedy/archive/2005/11/16/493628.aspx), courtesy of William Kennedy from Microsoft, shows how Outlook 2007 works when you want to set up a new e-mail account. You just specify your name, e-mail address and password, and when you click "Next" Outlook tries to connect to the domain in your e-mail address in a variety of ways, instead of letting you specify the type of e-mail server, ports to use, et.c. People who have configured [Gmail](http://gmail.com) for POP-use know what I'm writing about; for the average user, this involves a lot of trial and error. Too bad that Kennedy's posting ceased in November 2005.

Don't forget there's a new issue of [Start The Week](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/starttheweek.shtml) out today; that's the only podcast show I listen to regularly.

[![Condemned building](http://static.flickr.com/42/125601622_7386f35b6d_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=125601622) Before you go listening to funny intellectuals discussing a broad array of subjects, check [vyew.com](http://vyew.com) out. It's a free site dedicated to helping people to meet online, share files, a whiteboard, pictures, snap screen-shots, search Google together, among [other features](http://vyew.com/content/index.php?n=Main.FeatureList). You can compare it to other products [here](http://vyew.com/content/index.php?n=Main.ComparisonChart). I quickly tried it out with a colleague, and it worked very well. We dabbled on a whiteboard, wrote text-messages, looked at American through Yahoo! Maps, searched Google together and commented the results, uploaded screen-shots and found the system to be working well. I like it, so far.

Happy gay news in the world of film, courtesy of [The Guardian](http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1750878,00.html), makes me hail [Charlize Theron](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000234) even more than her part in "[Monster](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0340855)" made me do in the first place:

> [Transamerica](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407265), for which Felicity Huffman received an Oscar nomination in her role as a pre-op male-to-female transsexual, was named the outstanding film in limited release at the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation's ([GLAAD](http://www.glaad.org)) annual media awards in LA on Saturday night. Ang Lee's gay cowboy tale [Brokeback Mountain](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795) was the outstanding wide-release film. Charlize Theron was honoured for increasing "visibility and understanding" in the gay community. The move follows her vow last year not to tie the knot with boyfriend Stuart Townsend until gay marriage is legally recognised in the US. Theron also won an Oscar for playing lesbian serial killer Aileen Wuornos in 2003's [Monster](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0340855).

And oh, it's nice to see how [people who mistake minor coffee-place DoubleShot for Starbucks are called stupid](http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/doubleshot-coffee/doubleshot-coffee-to-customers-mistook-us-for-starbucks-youre-an-idiot-165459.php); not that I know anything about DoubleShot except that they refuse to give in to [insane legal hassle from Starbucks](http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/starbucks/starbucks-sues-doubleshot-espresso-165158.php). Go, go, go, you heroes!

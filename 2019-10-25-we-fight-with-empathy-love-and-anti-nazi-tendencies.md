According to [a month-old survey](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/ny-matning-sverigedemokraterna-nast-storsta-parti), sverigedemokraterna—the Swedish democrats; a misnomer—are now the second-biggest political party in Sweden.

This sticker shows love smashing [NMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Resistance_Movement), a Swedish nazi organisation; they and sverigedemokraterna stem from the same dirt, both figuratively and literally.

The [Swedish general election is coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Swedish_general_election).

Neither of these cretin "parties" can even nazi their way out of a paper bag. From Swedish news:

https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/svenska-akademien-agerar-mot-nmr-sajten-nordfront/

The Swedish Academy acts against NMR who are trying to use the works of Swedish authors and get away with it (by using the works in a nazi context).

Mattias Karlsson, the group leader of sverigedemokraterna, rallies against somebody whom he calls "pansy of the kingdom", against homosexual parents, against 'abnormal sexual deviations', and the usual that we've come to expect from nazi-theory college dropouts.

If we won't keep a close eye on how sverigedemokraterna, NMR, and their ilk work, we won't be able to find all things common between ourselves and their potential fans.

If we don't keep a dialogue going with those fans, we run the risk of becoming just as trapped, sectarian, and brainwashed as they can be, which is equally as bad as joining their extreme right-wing party.

It's not the people who are fucked-up, it's their parties.

Sure, people make the party, but people's minds can be changed. However, their god—i.e. their party—will not as easily turn straight.

My maternal grandmother died at 93 years of age, exactly nine years ago today.

She was, and always will be a source of inspiration to me.

She used to live in an apartment complex facing a yard. When other old persons used to shout at the neighbourhood kids for kicking soccer balls or basically being kids, she used to scowl at the oldies: "I'm older than you are, and I remember what it was like being a kid! Let them have their fun and shut up!"

F-in' gangsta.

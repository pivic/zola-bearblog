![Noisettes](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-11-23-thenoisettes.jpg)[This band](http://www.thenoisettes.com) is extremely underrated. While [The White Stripes](http://thewhitestripes.com) still enjoy loads of fame even though their latest album - in my very humble, most humble, _extremely_ humble opinion - reeks of shite, this bunch deserves kudos through the roof.

They're a four-year-old London-based trio who have recently released their debut-album, [_What's The Time Mr Wolf?_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_the_Time_Mr._Wolf%3F_%28album%29). I love Shingai Shoniwa's voice, yet the band's forté is really their combined energy. Radiant. Even though they're toured-out at the moment, having spent the last two years globetrotting, I urge them to hit Stockholm, Sweden. _Come_!

Here's a brilliant track for you. Get it now, as it will be deleted after a week's airtime.

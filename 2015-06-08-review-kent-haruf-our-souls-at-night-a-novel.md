[![5ap_BXF](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/5ap_BXF.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/5ap_BXF.jpg) [Our Souls at Night: A novel](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23602562) by [Kent Haruf](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16266)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1291873714)  
  
This is a very sweet, human and simply - yet subtly - told tale of two people meeting each other in old age. The language is the sublime, and the tale is the vessel for the content. The care...the words!

> They lay next to each other and listened to the rain. So life hasn’t turned out right for either of us, not the way we expected, he said. Except it feels good now, at this moment. Better than I have reason to believe I deserve, he said. Oh, you deserve to be happy. Don’t you believe that? I believe that’s how it’s turned out, for these last couple of months. For whatever reason. You’re still skeptical about how long this will last. Everything changes. He got up again from bed.

I cried a few times as I read this book, which is really a sum total of what matters most to some people. In love, in life.

> Aren’t you afraid of death? Not like I was. I’ve come to believe in some kind of afterlife. A return to our true selves, a spirit self. We’re just in this physical body till we go back to spirit. I don’t know if I believe that, Addie said. Maybe you’re right. I hope you are. We’ll see, won’t we. But not yet. No, not yet, Addie said. I do love this physical world. I love this physical life with you. And the air and the country. The backyard, the gravel in the back alley. The grass. The cool nights. Lying in bed talking with you in the dark.

I love the dialogue, and how it's written.

> We’re not even old news. We’re not even news of any kind at all, old or new, Louis said. Do you want to be news? No. Hell. I just want to live simply and pay attention to what’s happening each day. And come sleep with you at night. Well, that’s what we’re doing. Who would have thought at this time in our lives that we’d still have something like this. That it turns out we’re not finished with changes and excitements. And not all dried up in body and spirit. And we’re not even doing what people think we’re doing. Do you want to? Addie said. That’s entirely up to you.

I won't tell more about the synopsis or plot, but it kind of thickens, without being vulgar. This is a book that will stick with me for some time to come.

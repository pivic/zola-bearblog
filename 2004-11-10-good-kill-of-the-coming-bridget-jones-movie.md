I just read a great review of [the new Bridget Jones film by Jessica Winter](http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0445/winter2.php). I love these lines:

> All this unaccountable admiration is bestowed upon the ne plus ultra of the regressive rom-com heroine, a thirtysomething who displays the rudimentary motor functions, raging id, and darling pucker of a cuddly infant.

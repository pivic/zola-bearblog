_This post contains some TMI: be warned if you're sensitive to words like "yellow snot" ((Which is actually not in here at all.))._

Well, there has been **no** week at work. Instead, I've been ill at home, about as handy to my nearest universe and X as GW Persson's leather vests are to fashion.

I hate being sick. I hate being a zombie whose only purpose is spewing bile, eating, and probably smelling bad ((I haven't dared ask X about that, and my sense of smell is shot.)). I went to the doctor today. My cough has finally showed signs of dying down. I've had a tough time breathing of late, so I got some [terbutaline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terbutaline) prescribed which has done the trick (and sends my heart into the high palpitations). I've still got a head ache, I'm snivelling and I'm generally weak, but it's toffee compared to what that's all been like.

It feels good to be able to concentrate on something for more than five minutes straight. I'm glad that I'm able to stand up for periods of time longer than a few minutes without having a head ache. I can once again lift stuff that's heavier than a teacup. My head doesn't constantly feel like it's exploding. And I'm happy that I'm living in a country where I can be sick for an entire week and not lose my job.

Pretty soon I'll be able to listen to music again. Being without music for a week has been awful. I'm glad that X has been home a lot during the time I've been at home, but at the same time I'm unhappy that I've snivelled and coughed through an entire week for her sake. I'm really sorry for putting her through that.

So, coming back to life. Back to normal. It actually feels strange sitting at a computer, which is a lot of what I do at work (and enjoy doing). Here's hoping for a very merry xmas. I'll be in-doors, and even if I'll be unable to sense any tastes or smells, I guarantee you that I'll be happy about just living a lot more than before.

P.s. Did you know that [ear clearing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_clearing) is great to help the ears to get rid of fluids that assimilate when you're sick?

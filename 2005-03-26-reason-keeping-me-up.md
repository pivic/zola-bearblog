Right [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-26-vidrig.mp3) you can download a little snippet \[MP3, 250KB\] I just made in [Reason](http://www.propellerheads.se//products/reason/index.cfm?fuseaction=get_article&article=whatisreason). It's a little synthesizer ditty I programmed through the Malström device and a Matrix, to follow a Tresor bass-drum. It'll be interesting to see if I manage to get loops in there and then make a compelling techno track. I think it'll be easy enough to try and make something like that to start with. Trance (which is a genre I mainly detest, despite there existing a very few glimpses of light) would be harder, as it means two things: 1) I'd have to learn about the delay and reverb controls, which is too hard for me right now, and 2) I sometimes like playing scales on the electric guitar, as it keeps up and enhances my agility on the fret-board, but I'll be damned before I start mapping scales on a sequencer - without a MIDI keyboard. Imagine using the mouse to constantly map, listen to and check a reverb-tinged, delay-drowned and extremely annoying loop? I'm reminded of what [George Clinton](http://www.georgeclinton.com) called disco: "Man! Talk about something getting on your nerves! It's like trying to make love with just one stroke."

Now it's time to bed. God damn it. Tomorrow [Milka](http://www.niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-07-24-v-all/images/PICT0061.jpg)'s having a birthday invite to meet her at [à  la Cràªpe](http://www.crepes.nu), so now's bed-time. Ah! I can't get Reason out of my head! I really wanna learn the stuff.

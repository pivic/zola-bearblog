[![Picture taken from my office window.](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-12-28-winter.jpg "Picture taken from my office window.")](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-12-28-winter.jpg)The idea of _hating_ a winter wonderland never hits you as reality until you're walking in one, especially one that's sub-zero degrees Celsius. I do like the big flakes dropping down, but since I lost something along the lines of 15-20 kg's of fat, I tend easily to freeze whenever the temperature isn't fair. Global warming, woo-hey.

Another thing about weather, will Rockstar Games be swapping the comforts of hot USA for London, when the next GTA-game hits? [It's merely a rumour](http://www.joystiq.com/2005/12/27/rumor-grand-theft-auto-london-for-ps3-in-q4-2006), but never the less it would be fun to see it happen.

Speaking of lovely rumours, people have been saying that [the recent film about Narnia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363771) is good, but for those of us who've actually seen it that's an exaggeration along the lines of saying [Steve Jobs is proud of having Dubya as customer](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/15/AR2005121502378.html). There are only two good things about the film, or rather three if you're counting that [Azlan/Jesus looks like it's been rendered through PowerPoint](http://www.20threed.com/images/pics/3d/pics/lion.jpg), and they're simple to find:

1. [Tilda Swinton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0842770) rules over all in this film - and that's because she's a great actor, not just because few in this film can act. By the way, I really hope "[Nico](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413046)" gets made.
2. SNL has made [this parody](http://www.youtube.com/watch.php?v=zLElfJ9YCh0) of the film.

Right now I'm looking forward to seeing "Memoirs Of A Geisha" even though it's [not received favourable reviews](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/memoirs_of_a_geisha). I'm not giving up though, and I'm probably going to see "[Wolf Creek](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolf_creek)" some day despite [Ebert's slaying it](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051222/REVIEWS/51220004/1023), just to prove to myself I still know how to completely waste two hours of my life; as if the Narnia-flick hasn't, already!

I was going to write something about how Zak and I went out the other night, but [he's already done so](http://zakdaddys.blogspot.com/2005/12/english-pubs-parents-stuff.html) in great fashion. All I can say is we've extended our friendship from actually meeting face to face, to e-mails, SMS's and now covering each-other in blogs, isn't the information society wonderful? Fawk it, I'll write something about it anyway. It was great meeting his parents, of course I've met his dad before and he's great fun, but as we continued our journey (through the total of three places we visited - that thanks to the damned blizzard outside limited us to a short stretch of places to go) from Bishops Arms (where I had [Nils Oscars julöl](http://www.nilsoscar.se/se/ol/julol), a christmas beer from 2003 which is magnificent) to Black and White, a nice pub, but they all closed so early due to it being xmas so we got in at Eken, a hotel bar where they played nice funk music, I had some [Carnegie Porter](http://www.carlsberg.se/wbch3.exe?p=1001090) and we left just before one o'clock because Zak was a coward :D I had to work the day after, dang it! Sho nuff, Zak and I were bound to go out today as well but even though I know I'd love it I feel tired and dreadful in the nose area - not in [a Tommy Körberg way](http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/photos/cocaine/cocaine.jpg) - so I'm snivelling away like the little punk I am.

Having listened to [Liam Howlett's "Back To Mine"](http://www.progressive-sounds.com/features/Liam-Prodigy-Back-To-Mine.asp) compilation promo I can't get ELO's "[Livin' Thing](http://www.lyricsondemand.com/soundtracks/b/boogienightslyrics/livinthinglyrics.html)" out of my head. "[Kill me, Billy!](http://www2.burn.com/content/wave/wav-sp6/grandpa-stan-so_now_will_you_kill_me_billy_sure_i_will_grandpa.wav)"

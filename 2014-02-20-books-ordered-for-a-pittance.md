Not even 20 Swedish Crowns a book from [Bokus](http://www.bokus.com)!

If you haven't read [Michael Cunningham](http://www.michaelcunninghamwriter.com)'s "[_By Nightfall_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8100015-by-nightfall)", you really, really should. The rest I haven't read, but they're undoubtedly worth it. I can't wait to read his coming book, "_[The Snow Queen](http://www.michaelcunninghamwriter.com/books/snow_queen)_".

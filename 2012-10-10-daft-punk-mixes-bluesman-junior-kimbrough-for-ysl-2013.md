[Daft Punk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk) has made the above mix of [Junior Kimbrough](http://www.fatpossum.com/artists/junior-kimbrough) tracks for the latest fashion show that Yves Saint Laurent has done. It's not very unlike them, considering their DJ efforts in the past. I hope this makes a lot more people appreciate Fat Possum Records and their artists, e.g. [R.L. Burnside](http://www.fatpossum.com/artists/rl-burnside).

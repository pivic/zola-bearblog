I ordered [the Eddie Izzard box](http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=12724) I've written about previously. Also, I recently framed an [Eddie Izzard photograph](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-10-27), showing the cover of "Dress To Kill".

Mikaela and I recently saw his "Sexie", which wasn't all that fun. I mean, it does contain loads of his famous good ad-lib but the show in its entirety wasn't all that together. It's possible it was shot early during a tour, but then again his spontaneity came into full bloom with "Definite Article", methinks. I'll also check out "Dress To Kill". Most people who've seen it say it's extremely funny. Rade has seen it, and he liked it better than "Definite Article" which is my favourite this far. We'll see how I like it! I mean, Rade and I mostly share the same humor, but I got the last laugh recently as I killed him in a PS2 racing game, moahaha! HA!

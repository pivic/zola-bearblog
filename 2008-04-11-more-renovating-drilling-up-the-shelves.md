As I wrote about the shelf-situation yesterday, I thought I'd update what's happened since then.

I phoned dad on the way back to work during lunch from having bought screws, plugs and an extra drill, and asked him whether he had an 8-millimeter drill or not. "I do", he said. Thinking that he previously had said that he knew that three screws would suffice for one of the short shelves and it fell down, I decided to be adamant. "Are you sure that you have an 8-millimeter drill?" I asked again. "Yeah, I'm sure!"

When dad turned up, he didn't have one, and the drill I'd bought didn't fit his drill. Brilliant. I then told him I'd rent a working drill tomorrow and do all the work myself, as I was getting tired of the ordeals combined with this. Dad went home and I felt I should have seen it all coming. Argh!

Until an hour later, when dad called again: "Niklas! I have a new drill! Should we try it?"

Having subjected him to a blazing interview on whether he really had an 8-millimeter drill _this time_, asking him detailed questions like "how do you _know_ it's an 8-millimeter drill?" and "yeah, it fits in the 8-millimeter mount, but does it **say** it's an 8-millimeter drill?", to which he swore "Yes!"; he then was allowed to come over, with a new drill as well.

We set all the shelves in place and this time didn't waste any screws. From the biz:

    

Dad did his work, even though he came up with some weird solutions that I had to kill in their infancy, like the idea to fill the holes in one wall with a lot of plaster, wait for it to go stale and then immediately mount the shelves - for no apparent reason. I also had to contain him from going hysterical, which would have made him fuck up our newly painted wall. He moves like a burning squirrel when agitated and hyped.

After he and I had mounted the shelves we discovered that two of the metal mounts were upside-down. Hey yaaaa! However unphased - and with X's great mental help - dad and I turned them the right way around and voilà¡, everything was done.

So far, they haven't fallen down. I'm still a tad scared of the possibility of that happening, though, but we'll see. I spoke with a handiman who told me he'd probably charge 6400SKR (not including VAT) which is appx. 1000USD for two days' work to fix the shelves. Are you frikkin' joking? Hell no.

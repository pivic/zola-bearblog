Here's my third muxtape, and I've compiled songs throughout the past week for this. It's available [here](http://pivic.muxtape.com)! Tracklist's here:

1\. **Mystery Jets** - "Zootime"

Everybody needs a band that goes their own way while producing listenable, danceable, headstrong and fairly avant-garde music. Mystery Jets goes the way beyond their smash hit "You Can't Fool Me Dennis" and brings this to the table. Did you know the frontman's guitarist is his dad?

2\. **The Libertines** - "Skint & Minted (demo)"

Much in the same spirit as the previous track, The Libertines offer a demo that sounds like it could have fitted in quite well in their second album. I think it's got a nice music hall-tradition stamped in the chorus, feedback-laden as it is.

3\. **The Jesus and Mary Chain** - "Happy When It Rains"

Americana-ish blues from Scotland, signed by a couple of brothers who turned feedback into an artform with their groundbreaking album "_Psychocandy_" shows us the future in what will happen when DNA scientists cross a Motown girl group with [The Stooges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stooges).

4\. **Manic Street Preachers** - "This Is Yesterday"

The Manics followed up their second album with "[_The Holy Bible_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holy_Bible_%28album%29)", recorded in a studio that most big bands use for recording demos. The result is a quite flat sound, which combined with wonderful melodies and lyrics, ideas and propaganda, helped to propel the album to critical stardom and fandom. This track has great lyrics and one of the best guitar solos of the 90's.

5\. **The Breeders** - "Wicked Little Town (Hedwig Version)"

As The Breeders release [their new album](http://www.breedersdigest.net) today, I guess a little cover isn't bad; the musical and film "Hedwig And The Angry Inch" has done a lot for modern musical tales, and this song is great proof of that. The Breeders have scaled down the original to a warm and slightly fuzzy guitar sound.

6\. **Ash** - "Does Your Mother Know?"

If [Okkervil River could cover this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLa-vbZCJAY), so can Ash! They released this as a b-side for "Oh Yeah", back in the 90's.

7\. **Buzzcocks** - "I Don't Mind"

Power-pop in all its glory, here are the champions. Buzzcocks emerged with the first English punk-movement and their "_[Singles Going Steady](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singles_Going_Steady)_" is one of [my fave albums](http://www.listsofbests.com/list/1683).

8\. **Frank Zappa & the Mothers** - "Cheepnis"

There's not enough Zappa in the media today - [sadly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ISil7IHzxc) - and I'm afraid there's really no way to introduce his broad musical spectrum, but this track serves as an introduction to two of his things: his fondness for cheap movies and how complex his music is. This is from the eclectic and great live album "[_Roxy & Elsewhere_](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:hpfrxqq5ldse)".

9\. **Ministry** - "Psalm 69"

As political as they come, Ministry served a hot blast against religion and political hypocrites when they released "[_Psalm 69_](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0bfuxqe5ldfe)" in 1992. The songs spew energy and message, without becoming preachy. Headnodders everywhere, start a-noddin'!

_And now, it's time for us, to give a little love back to Gawd._

10\. **Weezer** - "Across The Sea"

Emo the way emo should be, Weezer's incredibly underestimated magnum opus, "_Pinkerton_", went against the grain of most albums at the time, mostly because of their playfulness and melodic upper hand. The lyrics go to show greatness - and scariness - as well, as Cuomo sings:

> You are an 18-year-old girl who live in small city in Japan. You heard me, on the radio. About one year ago and you wanted to know, all about me, and my hobbies. My favorite food and my birthday
> 
> Why are you so far away from me? I need help and you're way across the sea I could never touch you - I think it would be wrong I've got your letter you've got my song

11\. **Super Furry Animals** - "Guacamole"

This song connects best with how I've felt when struck by sleep deprivation and too much caffeine.

12\. **Georges Delerue** - "Theme De Camille"

Complex and lovely, like Beach Boys' tracks, seemingly simple yet full of atmosphere and substance. A warm, dry towel after coming in from cold rain.

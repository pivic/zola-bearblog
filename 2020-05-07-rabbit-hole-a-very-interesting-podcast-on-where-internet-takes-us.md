Kevin Roose, technology columnist for New York Times, is the reporter in _[Rabbit Hole](https://www.nytimes.com/column/rabbit-hole)_, a new podcast that concentrates on the lives of people online.

The first three episodes have been about Caleb, a person who—to put it mildly—spends a lot of time on YouTube.

The series starts off with Caleb giving his entire YouTube history to Roose. From that, the listener starts hearing how Caleb is affected; I should have used _afflicted_ instead, as that better describes what goes on.

Roose interviews people who have tweaked YouTube algorithms.

> After all, for many of us, the world has been reduced to what we experience on screens. And the things on those screens are not neutral or inert. They’ve been put there on purpose and arranged, often by a combination of humans and sophisticated forms of artificial intelligence, to accomplish some goal. Maybe that goal is to make us click, buy or share. Maybe it’s to persuade us, or harden some part of our identity. Most of the time, what these machines want from us appears harmless. Once in a while, it actually is.

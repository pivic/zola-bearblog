From the film "[Over Her Dead Body](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0785007)", _that played in the background while I was doing other, extremely salient things_, there was a reference to [DFW](http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780241968321,00.html).

In other DFW-related news, "_[Signifying Rappers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signifying_Rappers:_Rap_and_Race_In_the_Urban_Present)_", the book he wrote on hip-hop together with [Mark Costello](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Costello_%28author%29), has just been [re-released from obscurity by Penguin](http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780241968321,00.html).

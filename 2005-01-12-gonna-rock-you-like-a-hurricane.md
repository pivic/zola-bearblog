We've had our fair share of bad weather in Sweden of recent.

Last week-end the very hard winds blew big branches off trees and made 150000 people in the south of Sweden very mad when their electricity fell out; some of them haven't even had it restored. Here's the next love-blow: tomorrow [weather.com predicts](http://www.weather.com/activities/travel/businesstraveler/weather/tenday-details.html?locid=SWXX0031&dayNum=1) we're going to have an average of -1 degrees Celsius, while having winds approximating 24 km/h. Urgh, I thought it was going to be something like 2,4 km/10 h. Ha. Eh.

I wish I'd go to bed and fall asleep. I'm not very sleepy at all, and I have to get up early tomorrow.

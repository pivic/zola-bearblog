I've written about MirrorMask, the coming film by Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman, [before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=756), but [here](http://wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,69015,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2)'s a brand-new interview with Dave McKean out of Wired Magazine, accompanied by a bunch of pictures from the film plus a rare one of McKean with Gaiman.

The interviewer adds that McKean and his team only used "over-the-counter software" such as [Maya](http://www.alias.com/glb/eng/products-services/family_details.jsp?familyId=3900009), to make the film using "only" 4 million USD. Besides, it seems both he and Gaiman were intent on making a film that doesn't delve too far into bizarroworld, where a lot of fantasy crap films go today, I say. I just hope Gaiman doesn't wander off into Spielberg-land. I swear, if there's even one child saving something in this film or is used like some kind of emotional ornament, I'll slash the seats. At the cinema, silly.

Dissonant music plays as the two men drive down Brighton.

**Blixa**:

I left, basically, because of our management, and I felt I couldn't keep up a marriage and two bands.  
  
Time was becoming a problem.  
  
I had no personal conflicts with you or anyone else in the band. I had no musical _[schisma](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/german-english/schisma)_ either.  
  
Video filmed without Nick:  
  
There were several reasons for why I left The Bad Seeds.

\[...\]  
  
I gave up the one that was less dear to my heart.

**Nick**:

I really don't know why Blixa left, except, I think he understood, and was courageous enough to understand that the collaborative process has its natural length, and then you move away.  
  
I miss Blixa enormously.  
  
It was just out of the blue. He sent me an e-mail saying he had problems with the management, which we all had at the time. I rang up and said, look, I can deal with the manager \[...\] because I was devastated by that.  
  
I think he said 'I'll think about it' and didn't get back to me.  
  
**Interviewer**: you didn't call him again?  
  
**Nick**: No, I just knew. I knew.

Brighton rocks, this atmosphere doesn't.

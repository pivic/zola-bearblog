From Anil Kumar Kandangath's blog, [where you can read about the whole ordeal](http://www.ecogito.net/anil/2005/02/boy-who-topped-nasa-but-didnt.html):

> On February 17th, Rediff along with many other Indian news agencies reported that a 17 year old boy from Uttar Pradesh, Saurabh Shukla had topped the NASA International Scientist Discovery exam. I thought it was interesting and checked Google News for other related reports, but it seemed that only Indian news agencies were reporting it. Pretty strange for an exam of supposedly high repute. Not even the main Google search engine had anything to say about this exam.

Another great example of people who don't check their sources for the facts!

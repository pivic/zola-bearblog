[![Nothing but flowers](http://static.flickr.com/66/177947109_461d4659ac_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=177947109) If you've got a load of dosh to spend, feel free to ravage it on [this lovely box](http://www.rhino.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=73212) with stuff by [Björk](http://www.bjork.com).

Yeah, you want some tea with that? Use [this kettle](http://news.com.com/2061-10801_3-6089286.html) - albeit only valid in the UK with Orange. Nerd-out.

[Babyshambles](http://www.babyshambles.net) are having a bunch of their b-sides [released as a bunch through iTunes](http://www.prefixmag.com/news/Babyshambles/7832) America.

Writing on music, Pitchfork has assembled [this list](http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36588/Staff_List_100_Awesome_Music_Videos) of "100 awesome music videos". Quite American in choice, yet contains a lot of really great ones. Never underestimate Art Of Noise's "Close (To The Edit)".

Writing on music, Bill Simmons, one of the funniest writers I know of (as he can make sports funny, which I consider to be a league of its own) has unearthed [this list](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/060626) of his fave YouTube-moments, which are pretty far from sports altogether; ranging from wrestling to Michael Jackson, check it out.

[Here](http://www.419eater.com/html/john_boko.htm)'s one of the best scams I've ever seen, if not _the_ best. The knowledgeble recipient gets a [Nigerian scam-letter](http://home.rica.net/alphae/419coal) and nixes the sender by getting him to craft _wooden figurines_ from [Creature Comforts](http://www.creaturecomforts.tv) and a replica of a [Commodore 64](http://www.granneman.com/images/Commodore_64_Box.jpg). I'm not making this up. It's brilliant. On the other hand, the culprit probably makes more money in one month than I do in a year; check the info that's on the very bottom end of that site.

Beck is en-route with a new hip-hop-ish album, to be produced by Neil Godrich. More info [here](http://www.soundgenerator.com/news/showarticle.cfm?articleid=7926&CFID=14789351&CFTOKEN=61242713).

Great t-shirt, [this one](http://www.threadless.com/product/259/Stabby_McKnife).

Interesting threat to [MS PowerPoint](http://www.microsoft.com/powerpoint) is what [Zoho Show](http://www.zohoshow.com) is; very reminiscent of [Thumbstacks](http://www.thumbstacks.com), too. An article about Zoho Show is found [here](http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/?p=219).

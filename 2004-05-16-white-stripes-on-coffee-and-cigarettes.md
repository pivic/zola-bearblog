[Here's an interview](http://www.nerve.com/screeningroom/film/coffeeandcigarettes/) that Nerve did with the [White Stripes](http://www.whitestripes.com), about them appearing in [Jim Jarmusch](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000464)'s new film, "[Coffee and Cigarettes](http://www.apple.com/trailers/mgm/coffee_and_cigarettes)".

While on that film, I really wonder if it's good or not. Sure, there are a lot of interesting celebrities, but does that make the grade? I'd love to see the scene where RZA and GZA speaks with Bill Murray, or the one where Iggy Pop converses with Tom Waits.

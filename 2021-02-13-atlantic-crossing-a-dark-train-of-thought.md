Norwegian television has made a dramatic series about the Norwegian royal family during World War II.

I was glad to see Kyle MacLachlan in it; I will forever have a special place in my heart for him after _Twin Peaks_. All three seasons.

I have, so far, seen the first episode of _Atlantic Crossing_, a series that draws inspiration from modern series that have drawn inspiration from _Downton Abbey_.

Piercing views of normality, of how everyday royal life cluttered while Hitler made its way closer to the border?

Glassware tinkles and shines. Carpets are clean. Snow falls quietly. Staff tend to the everyday needs of the royals. The Norwegian royals, who could not affect Norwegian politics, speak with President Roosevelt, who is played by MacLachlan.

'Hitler won't get us, right? He won't come here?'

Unless I remember incorrectly, I believe George Orwell used the term 'non-people' for people who didn't matter to decision-makers. Poor people without money, without any say in things, who couldn't affect the lives of the ones at the top. Orwell, naturally, used this term to describe how little most people meant to the few at the top.

There are plenty of non-people in this first episode. They're seldom seen, except when they expedite the Norwegian royal family's flight from nazism until they're no longer needed.

Stay in the royal palace and tend to everything, butler, while we hide in the cottage up north. Up north, where, surely, nazis won't go, because they take the southern and middle parts first, right? We'll be safe. Let's go. Not you, butler, of course not you.

The creators of this series may claim that by setting the royal family in tiff, they're showing what all citizens of Norway experienced.

Normalising nazism is a step-by-step process, seen all over the world, in different steps, through not only nazism, but other types of structures, for example monarchy.

Nazism is a christian cult. _Mein Kampf_ lays it out clearly. Things must be this way because the Lord said so.

If you have worked hard enough and long enough, you may be rewarded by being born a monarch. Born into eternal wealth, into never having to fear extreme poverty or anything even like it.

The king of Norway makes some haphazard guesses as to what will happen next paired with magical thinking: if _we_ (meaning his immediate family and some servants) go away, farther into Norway, the _problems_ will go away.

The non-people, for example the working classes and the spoken targets of nazi persecutions, lacked the means to pack up and go in any sense of the word.

Spoiler warning: by the end of the first episode, the Swedish-born queen of Norway forces a servant to drive through barriers set up by a Swedish border patrol. They wouldn't let her through in spite of her social standing. But her servant smashed the gate with a royal car. Perhaps the barriers didn't break but actually just bent according to royal will.

Naturally, nothing happened to the fleeing royal family.

When other people attempted to flee nazi persecution, what happened then? Were they saved?

The king of Norway claims that England will support them.

I think of the Jews of Guernsey. Guernsey, the little island from where England not only allowed illegal deportation of Jews to nazis, but helped out with it. The Jews were registered, detained, and sent to their certain deaths. I may remember erroneously, but I believe no Jews survived their leaving Guernsey.

The non-people were simply replaced with non-Jews. In some cases, the previous employers may have chosen to wait out World War II so that they could hire back some Jews later on. Of course, in fear that whoever won World War II would possibly also persecute Jews, as has occurred for many centuries.

I have suggestions to make.

Let's erase the pathology that is treating people differently depending on made-up circumstances like 'class', whether they are royal, or 'race'.

The more mental barriers you erect, the less free you are.

The suffering that _Atlantic Crossing_ so far is, tries to engage you with the thought that some animals are more equal than others. Naturally, this is a train of thought also shared by Hitler and his ilk. We know where that train stopped.

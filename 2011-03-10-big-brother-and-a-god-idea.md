As Swedish reality-show "[Big Brother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big%20Brother%20%28TV%20series%29)" is on air into its second week, two contestants have lost track of their realities and entered the realm of psychosis. I doubt the producers deem that as bad publicity, as they've - after the fact - broadcast huge chunks of the mental breakdowns which are, of course, viewable through the internet.

According to said producers there is a psychologist available, but seeing how they've collated exhibitionistic youths in a closed, completely wired ((Both metaphorically and literally speaking.)) environment with access to a constant flow of alcohol, I have a tough time to visualise how the screening-process for the applicants went down. Like:

"Well, you _say_ you've got what it takes to stay isolated with a select few people in a closed environment, constantly under close surveillance. Yes, all you do will be broadcast onto the internet and kept for all eternity. You do know what alcohol can do to you and others, right? Alright, just sign here."

Speaking of which, there's [this](http://svtplay.se/t/103450/debatt) recent episode of SVT Debatt, a popular, live Swedish TV-show; the episode deals with the dangers of "Big Brother", present and past.

[Eva Rusz](http://www.evarusz.se/), psychotherapist and partially responsible for screening applicants during the first two seasons of Big Brother in Sweden and Norway, respectively, states that she bailed out of the project when she felt the producers were pushing her more and more to approve applicants despite her objections.

**I've got a new idea.**

Why not send a person into the compound and call her/him God. Let that person constantly be in touch with the producers who let God hear about everything that happens in there. Then, let God cast down commandments. Tell the contestants they cannot gossip about God. Order them around. Punish them whenever. Make them feel even worse as they realise God gets word of everything that happens.

Would that speed up the process? While the producers seem bent on repeating that Big Brother is just a social experiment with the contestants being somewhat responsible for what happens to themselves, I've yet to find their words on how the screening-process is handled. And I'd love to see interviews with contestants from previous seasons regarding how Big Brother has affected their lives after the show ended. Sadly, it seems the producers of the current season will end any type of accountability as soon as the show is over and further publicity will be of less gain.

I just wonder what'll happen once the producers get hold of Luke Rhinehart's "[The Dice Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Dice%20Man)". I bet they'll be reading it while listening to Bros' "[When Will I Be Famous?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When%20Will%20I%20Be%20Famous%3F%20%28song%29)".

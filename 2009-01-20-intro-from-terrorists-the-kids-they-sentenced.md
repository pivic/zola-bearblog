In 2003, writers and directors [Lukas Moodysson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0600546) and [Stefan Jarl](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0418724) decided to make "[Terrorists: the kids they sentenced](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374272)" a documentary film about [the riots of 2001 in Gothenburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_during_the_EU_summit_in_Gothenburg_2001). One of the most spectacular things about the documentary is the intro, which shows video-clips from all over our Earth; these include political killings, war, genocide, the weapon industry making money, children being killed, innocent people being abused to shreds by police during the riots in Gothenburg, and so on - and the film-makers have even managed to put humor in there, and all to [bob hund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hund)'s "_Den lilla planeten_" ((A cover of [Plastic Bertrand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_Bertrand)'s "_Tout petit la planà¨te_".)). It sounds horrible, I know, and it does leave more than a bad taste in the mouth, but it's quite necessary. See at your own risk. The documentary is semi-hard to get hold of, but is essential viewing on the effects of globalist capitalism.

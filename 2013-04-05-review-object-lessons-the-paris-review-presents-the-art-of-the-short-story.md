[![Object Lessons: The Paris Review Presents the Art of the Short Story](http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1363435403m/13167173.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13167173-object-lessons)[Object Lessons: The Paris Review Presents the Art of the Short Story](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13167173-object-lessons) by [The Paris Review](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7373.The_Paris_Review)  
My rating: [3 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/425568595)  
  
Some short stories in this collection are really boring, pastime Americana junk, while others are mind-boggling and great; the ones by Ethan Canin, Bernard Cooper, Thomas Glynn and Denis Johnson are wonderful.

**Interviewer**: There seems to be a growing trend in Hollywood now, where there's a lot of prominent product placement. It's a partnership between the companies and he film. The companies will put their product prominently in the film and film will receive budget support as a result of advertising. How do you as a filmmaker feel about this growing trend?

**David Lynch**: Bullshit. That's how I feel. _Total. Fucking. Bullshit._

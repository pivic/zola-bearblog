The band [Deströyer 666](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destr%C3%B6yer_666) obviously hates women. During their performance in Stockholm in early January of 2018, the singer ("Warslut KK") said the following:

> Some women in this country have a problem with us. I know what they need. Hard dick! Fuck these political cunt suckers.

Later he added:

> This song is dedicated to the cunts in #killtheking.

One of the initiators of #killtheking - Emelie Draper - said this (translated by yours truly):

> It wasn't unexpected that Deströyer 666 would act embarrassingly. Too bad for them that they make such mediocre music that they feel the need to fill out their gigs by crying over our existence. That serves as proof of why #killtheking exists and is needed.

Emelie Draper is a hero.

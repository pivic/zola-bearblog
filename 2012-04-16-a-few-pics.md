I can't even begin to describe how much I love re-watching Twin Peaks from scratch again.

Checking into the ole Penguin "A Cover Story" with old postcards.

Sandwiches of the south. Of Stockholm.

My sister's older kid did a skateboard-in-the-milk thing again.

Swedish church commercials. A kid thinking about all things wonderous about being [waterboarded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding).

From "_[**Shared Beginnings, Divergent Lives: Delinquent Boys to Age 70**](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1140923.Shared_Beginnings_Divergent_Lives)_" by John H. Laub and Robert J. Sampson, which is a great read on criminology and squashes a lot of my prejudice when it comes to crime. Should really be read by everybody. Especially those who live in Sweden and love "_[Cops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cops_(TV_series))_" and "_[Efterlyst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efterlyst)_".

Dogge at work today. Hard at work.

**Note**: his former name - _Babe_ - is embossed in the dog-biscuit-shaped thing under his collar.

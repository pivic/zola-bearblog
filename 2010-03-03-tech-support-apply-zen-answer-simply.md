A user calls and speaks with me through the emergency phone IT hotline:

**Niklas**: IT, this is Niklas speaking, how may I help you? **user**: Yes, my name is...there's something wrong with my password. **N**: Are you unable to log into the computer? **u**: Well, yes! Wrong password! Wrong password!

I connect to the user's computer-screen to see what the user sees; the user _is_ logged in, but what appears to be wrong is that the city-wide intranet displays an error message upon logging in.

**N**: This error appears because-- **u**: It's always like this! I can't log in! The computer denies me. It denies me! **N**: You are logged into the network, but this error-- **u**: I can't work like this. I can't!

I now apply the Zen-like approach: stay very, very calm until the person focuses.

**u**: there's no way I can work like this! My work demands attention, and unless the computer is attentive enough \[sic\], I cannot...I...I don't behave in a way that...I can't. Why?

It seemed to me that the user was reaching critical mass. I was wrong.

**N**: I think-- **u**: No, it doesn't think, we don't think, hell, I don't know! **N**: The error-message that you see is due to a problem that another IT department is experiencing; you can still use your other applications and other web-sites that-- **u**: You always say that! You always do! What's the problem?

Zen. Critical mass.

**u**: Why are things like this? **N**: Well, some times things break, and-- **u**: Why do they break?

Zen. White dwarf. Nebulae. Implosion.

**N**: Because they can. Almost no things last forever. **u**: That almost seems philosophical! How can you say that about computers? **N**: Because computers are made by people, and they and the systems they run can malfunction. **u**: But...but...why do they malfunction? I mean, why are things like this? **N**: Because something that breaks does so at some point in time. **u**: I...see.

Of course, tech support is sometimes equal parts psychology, detective work, voodoo and other times, actual computer tech work.

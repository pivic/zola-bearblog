X once made [a playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/cyndamoore/playlist/16aAhWpy3WsqcodBuBjGaj) with tracks by **[The Magnetic Fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnetic_Fields)** ((Chronologically culling from the debut, up to and including the album "_Realism_".)). Here they are, and I've yet to find a better collection that sums the band up.

This reminds me infinitely of zipping through Oklahoma with X, Malin and Bobby. That two-door car that felt like home after a while. The flat landscapes floating past as I snapped pictures from the back seat of the car, slightly dazed, 30 minutes after the last drink. With X. With our beloved friends. In a overwhelming country I married in.

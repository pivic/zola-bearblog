This Monday X and I played at Nada again. The risotto was fabulous (as usual) and the music was great. Who were playing? Oh yes.

Ulrika, X's mom, came by to hang out. And the place was packed. People everywhere! We came at 20:00 and stood by ourselves next to a table where we had some food; friends started trickling in; Ida and her sister, Maylin and Criz and Daniel, Johan and his girlfriend (a.k.a. Gamla Stan), Dagny and Tobit, Anna B. and her boyfriend Mats, Kalle, a screaming Zak followed by Greven - and then went to work.

Here there be pictures from the ordeal:

  

I played quite the mixed bag of tracks, and the sheer number of people combined with the rush of setting the makeshift dancefloor on fire made my blood boil from the rush of adrenaline, through my cortex into my brain and heart! I can't tell you how watching people dance to what I was playing made me feel! Their kind words were so special. Magic. It always makes me wonder why I didn't take up DJ'ing professionally - until I remember the late nights and drunken people flopping a pint of beer over my records and that one time when I was threatened, kidnapped and received no pay; but that most definitely is not the case when DJ'ing at Nada.

While playing, I mixed The Smiths ("_[The Boy With The Thorn In His Side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_with_the_Thorn_in_His_Side_%28song%29 "The Boy with the Thorn in His Side (song)")_") with Justice's "_DVNO_", Eurythmics with [Lady GaGa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga "Lady Gaga"); I like Stuart Price's remix of "_Paparazzi_". Furacà£o 3000. Diplo's mix of [The Beatles](http://www.thebeatles.com "The Beatles") cover of "_[Twist and Shout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_and_Shout "Twist and Shout")_" created lost minds, as did [Kelis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelis "Kelis")' "_Milkshake_", [Kriss Kross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Kross "Kris Kross")' "_Jump_", Broder Daniel's "_Underground_", some Kraftwerk, Holy Fuck's remix of [M.I.A.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.I.A._%28artist%29 "M.I.A. (artist)")'s "_Paper Planes_", The Jam, SebastiAn's remix of Rage Against The Machine's "_Killing In The Name_", The Bar-Kays' "_Holy Ghost_", Hanson's "_Mmmbop_", The Commodore's "_Easy_" mixed with The Cure's "_Just Like Heaven_", Masters At Work's "_Runaway_" not to mention all what X was playing, e.g. tracks by Ladyhawke, Love Is All and TV On The Radio. And we ended by playing together, picking great tracks like [ABBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBA "ABBA")'s "_[Does Your Mother Know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Does_Your_Mother_Know "Does Your Mother Know")?_" ((Extra funny considering Ulrika's presence, of course.)), [Håkan Hellström](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kan_Hellstr%C3%B6m "Håkan Hellström")'s "_Kom igen Lena_" and Journey's "_[Don't Stop Believin'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Stop_Believin%27 "Don't Stop Believin'")_", The Libertines' "_Can't Stand Me Now_", Franz Ferdinand's "_Take Me Out_" ((The Erol Alkan remix is one of the best remixes ever. Full stop.)), tracks from Bonde Do Rolàª, Ace of Base and Hyper Crush and ended everything through [Bran Van 3000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bran_Van_3000 "Bran Van 3000")'s brilliant "_[Drinking in L.A.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ9KfKx8PmM)_".

It was great seeing my friends again. _A lot of my friends toniiight._

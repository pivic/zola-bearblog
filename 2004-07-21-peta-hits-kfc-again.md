[PETA](http://www.peta.org) have now unveiled further atrocities as performed by KFC. Check this recent article on the subject. KFC seem to be consisting of [completely ignorant idiots](http://www.kfc.com/about/animalwelfare.htm), from their so-called "Animal Welfare Program". From the PETA's web page:

> On July 20, 2004, PETA released the results of an undercover investigation into a KFC chicken slaughterhouse in Moorefield, W.Va., where workers were caught on video stomping birds, kicking them, and slamming them against floors and walls. Workers ripped the animals' beaks off, twisted their heads off, spat tobacco into their eyes and mouths, spray-painted their faces, and tied their legs together for "laughs."
> 
> The investigation was conducted at this location because it was the site of a KFC "Supplier of the Year" award ceremony, and PETA wanted to see the "best" that a KFC supplier had to offer. This slaughterhouse is run by Pilgrim's Pride, the second-largest chicken company in the U.S., after Tyson Foods.

Fuck KFC.

Anyway, I won't be renewing my PETA membership, even though they're doing a good thing for the animals. They're also sexist. Just check out this ad as an example. [Another ad](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-21-anderson.jpg) shows Pamela Anderson exposing her body.

If anybody knows of an ethical organisation that helps animals in general, comment this with pointers, please.

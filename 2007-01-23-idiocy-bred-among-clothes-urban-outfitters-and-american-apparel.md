When I bought my jacket from Urban Outfitters this October, I didn't figure they'd be [idiots against peace and keffiyehs](http://suicidegirls.com/news/politics/19959). Selling clothes is one thing, being culturally stupid is about the worst anybody's off.

Similarly, I didn't expect [American Apparel to be run in a sexist way](http://angryforareason.blogspot.com/2006/01/american-apparel-sweatshop-free-but-oh.html) by a person who repeatedly likes to masturbate while being interviewed.

So, where to turn now?

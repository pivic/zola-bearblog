I'll quote [Ed O'Brien from Radiohead on this](http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/131027/Mr-Russell-Brand), where [Russell Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Brand) is interviewed by [Jeremy Paxman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Paxman):

> Who'd have Adam and Eve'd it? Check this out... the man is right on it, in what he says, and mirrors what so many of us feel...

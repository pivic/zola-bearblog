Today I've had The Beatles' "[Birthday](http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Beatles/Birthday.html)" on my mind. I can't stand it. It's too catchy. Damn it. I've tried to go over to The Smiths' "[Unhappy Birthday](http://www.davemcnally.com/lyrics/TheSmiths/UNHAPPYBIRTHDAY.asp)" or something else, but it's impossible.

Damn "[The White Album](http://www.beatletracks.com/btwhite.html)". It's so good, even though the band was breaking up somewhat during its making.

You can download "Birthday" or listen to it in streaming RealAudio format from [here](http://www.iqm.ro/beatles/lyrics/pbirthday.html).

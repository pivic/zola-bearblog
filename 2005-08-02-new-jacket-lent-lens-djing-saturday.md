Today I found [this new jacket](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/30680847) at Nitty Gritty, who were having a sale. There's even a crappy cam-picture of me in it, right [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/30582878). It was down 50% due to the sale, so that's why I got it. Very nice fabric, very nicely made. It's extremely comfortable to wear. I got hold of an ass-ugly Stone Island-sweater to try on as I tried the jacket in the shop, and it's an autumn/spring model. I can probably wear it these evenings as well, as the summer is no longer hot in herre Sweden.

I met up with Fredrik today to lend his [70-300mm f/4-5.6G](http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/70300g.htm) lens. It's very cool. Weighing in at appx. 450 grams, it's a bit heavy, but using the sucker I'm able to zoom in appx. four times more than using my first 18-70mm lens. One has to be mighty stable on the hands, use a tripod or place the camera on solid ground before taking a picture when the lens is much elongated. I've taken two pictures using it, so far, thanks to the neighbourly hare that's prone to popping up on our front lawn now and again. Check [this picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/30671293), and [this picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/30671294) as well, to get the drift.

Today I found out I'm very likely DJ'ing at [Klubb Slick](http://www.klubbslick.se) come Saturday. That's soon! All I need is the word go from Daniel, one of the people arranging the event, as he has to check with Asynja, and we're go. "We're"? Well, I asked Frederic to DJ with me, so of course The Bespoke Brothers will make an event of it. I'm very much looking forward to it. I even turned down a chance to play at Club Fidelity at Bonden this Friday, just because I hope the gig at Slick will turn reality. Welcome, one and all. I'll keep you posted if it'll become reality or not. If you're coming, it's 60:- at the door, no wardrobe, and come before 22:30-23:00 if you don't want to stand in line for 20-30 minutes. I'm not exaggerating when I say the club is very popular. I'm definitely going to play my heart out, and try to be way better than the big dance-floor-DJ, moahaha. Let the games commence!

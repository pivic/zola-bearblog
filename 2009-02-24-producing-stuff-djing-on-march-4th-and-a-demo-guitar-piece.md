As I'm trying to loosen up and get more done than usual, creatively speaking. Thanks to [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting%20Things%20Done) and renewed will-power, I'm putting texts to paper and music to hard-drive. I'm aiming towards performing a little poetry of my own in about two weeks and [on March 4th X and I will be DJing](http://www.last.fm/event/925849) at [Nada on åsögatan](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=59.3136138%2C18.0792147&hl=en&z=16&ie=UTF8)! Facebook event's found [here](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=48596499150).

Yesterday evening, while watching some TV, I had an idea for a song, so I recorded it and here it is. I really like the shitty first draft-approach as opposed to waiting for the perfect song/poem/blog post to appear; I get much more out from producing and then either trashing or honing the piece. So here's an example of that.

Please do comment on what you think about the track ((And if you think the surviving Beatles are likely to sue for "_[Michelle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bC9fxAshlE)_" I'll...sue them right back!)).

I've finally bought my Nikon D70. It's a dream come true! I've snapped over 110 pictures already, and deleted almost all. It's lovely to snap a lot, but I've got to stay harsh; your favourites quickly become your enemies, if you know what I mean. I won't be logging fifty billion pictures in ten years, so I try to maintain a critical eye and delete duplicates, pictures that even look similar to ones I've already taken, should they not contain any new breath of life than the old. After [upgrading the firmware of the camera](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0505/05051701d70firmware.asp), I found that Microsoft has released [a thumbnail RAW-viewer](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0506/05061501msrawthumb.asp), integrated into the Windows Explorer shell. **Edit**: one can only install this program on WinXP SP2. Too bad it doesn't allow a user to save the RAW-files as another format. I really like working with the RAW-format. As somebody on the mighty Internet recently wrote, RAW is "the digital negative". It sure allows happy amateurs like me to behave like pro's when in the digital dark-room.

A couple of days ago \[avatar:/bilder/avatars/zak.gif\]Zak\[/avatar\] was home alone, so I joined him in Abrahamsberg, where we played [GTA:VC](http://www.rockstargames.com/vicecity) and watched the start of [a really shitty film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095990). Then suddenly the time was past 02:00 so I headed home on the subway, listening to [Trent Reznor's hosting a radio show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/alt/tracklistings/rockshow_archive.shtml?20050406), all broadcast on BBC radio. His choice of music wasn't bad. I discovered Saul Williams through him, and I strongly (yet again) recommend you check that guy out. Of course, after listening through [The Jesus & Mary Chain](http://aprilskies.amniisia.com) and [My Bloody Valentine](http://www.mybloodyvalentine.net), I really wonder what [Primal Scream](http://www.primalscream.org) are up to. Those guys have constructed some of my favourite albums and songs, so I really, really hope, that they (Kevin Shields included) will produce a giant of a record. Don't go Oasis on us now!

Yesterday Mikaela, Frederic and I went to a midsummer's party at Mikaela's parents' house, but they weren't there; Mikaela's brothers hosted the show together with Mikael and Sebastian's respective girl-friends, and provided the entertainment, i.e. the foods, the place and the music. The weather was supreme and we started off drinking Moà«t & Chandon vintage, the champion of fair-priced champagnes. The people were all young and nice, and we had a nice time, sitting in the sun, drinking, eating meat that Mikael had grilled, potatoe salad that Mikael and Karin had made, and the Jimi Hendrix-wannabe music of Jack Johnson.

We went home fairly soon. [Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-06-25)'s a gallery of pictures from the past days, some from my old camera, some from my new one. You'll even see a couple of frames displaying my work at cleaning out our microwave oven.

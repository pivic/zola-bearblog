YouTube have just launched fully-fledged movies. There aren't many of them, but those that exist, are quite tacky, including a lot of Bollywood films. Here are some of my faves from the entire collection, with IMDb grades:

 [_"Fantasy Mission Force"_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079509/) \[Jackie Chan\], 4,6/10

 "_[Wheels On Meals](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087578/)_" \[Jackie Chan\], 6,9/10

From the non-embeddable films we have "[_The Many Faces of Sherlock Holmes_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fefxO6W06aU)", where Christopher Lee hosts an overview of Sherlock Holmes as Arthur Conan Doyle wrote of him, as portrayed on the stage, on radio, television, and in the motion pictures by dozens of actors from 1900 to 1985. So sticky! Lee is - as always - great fun without meaning to be.

Also, you have "_[Raw Spice: The Unofficial Story Of The Making Of The Spice Girls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DcPM28pC2E)_"! Get back to the 90s...

 "[_Fist of Fury_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068767/)" \[Bruce Lee\], 7.0/10

Bruce Lee! Wooo!

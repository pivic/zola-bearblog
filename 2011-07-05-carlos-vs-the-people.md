![Carlos by Olivier Assayas](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/CarlosPoster.jpg/450px-CarlosPoster.jpg)

I've recently seen [a good made-for-tv fictional documentary](http://filmaster.com/film/carlos/short-review-pivic/) by [Olivier Assayas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Assayas), on [Ilich Ramà­rez Sà¡nchez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_the_Jackal), a.k.a. Carlos The Jackal.

In the below embedded excerpt of an interview recently conducted by Swedish TV, Ramirez talks about how "we never had 10% of innocents killed or wounded" and that they never had more than "150 innocents victims \[...\] not that much".

There's an entire episode of the Swedish TV series "_Kobra_" dedicated to the man and Assayas' documentary, including the whole of the aforementioned interview, available until Thursday; watch it [here](http://svtplay.se/v/2428608/kobra/kobra_special_schakalen), if you live in Sweden.

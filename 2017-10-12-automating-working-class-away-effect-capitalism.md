I just wrote what's below after having read the article above; click the image to read it.

I recall listening to [an episode of the BBC radio chat series named "Start The Week"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0713zf1) about a year ago. One of the speakers was an automation expert, and had partaken at a major European summit on automation. Also there was a CEO for a major car-building company. He stated how the technology to automate nearly all of the car-building process in their company was in place, but if they were to switch the button to do so, it would "wipe out the middle class". I think this statement, the power, how capitalism leads to oligarchy and plutocracy, means that we have to start dismantling our constant race for profit. Remember how [Alan Greenspan spoke about how "worker insecurity"](https://www.rawstory.com/2014/05/noam-chomsky-on-class-warfare-the-rich-think-worker-insecurity-is-a-good-thing/) is one of the main building blocks for having a rich elite. And we're there now. Let's build against it. And don't be afraid to destroy; Einstürzende Neubauten once stated "Destruction is not negative. You have to destroy in order to build."

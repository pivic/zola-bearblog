Yesterday, I got caught up at [SuicideGirls](http://suicidegirls.com) \[note: the first page currently displays breasts (among other stuffs), so those of you afraid to face what you probably faced several times every day when you were an infant, look otherwhere\], where I found an interview with Jaime Hernandez. The site, sporting a bad name, but very interesting interviews, have got a lot of those up. I sat reading for an hour, sifting through interviews with [Udo Kier](http://suicidegirls.com/words/Udo+Kier), [Charlotte Hatherley](http://suicidegirls.com/words/Ash%27s+Charlotte+Hatherley), [Darren Aronofsky](http://suicidegirls.com/words/Darren+Aronofsky+-+The+Fountain), [Peter Bagge](http://suicidegirls.com/words/Peter+Bagge) and [Xaime](http://suicidegirls.com/words/Jaime%20Hernandez).

By no way, don't you just love a review that starts with the following:

> Revenge of the Sith is at best a mediocre movie. Episode I was a preamble disguised as a film; its successor was space opera at its worst, making this by default the highlight of the second trilogy. But removed from the Star Wars context, Sith is just another big, blustery action movie. Sometimes entertaining, frequently trying, and often forgettable.

Check it out wholly, [here](http://chud.com/reviews/2855). On the other hand, for a glance of what's probably going to become a very good film, [check this poster out](http://chud.com/nextraimages/May122005W&G.jpg). They strike again!

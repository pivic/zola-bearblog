A sweet taste, indeed, embedded in a non-invasive taste. There's really no tang in this coffee, and even though I love dark and distinctive tastes in coffee, this is a bit too bland for me. The sweetness and the claimed tropical fruitiness doesn't come out. Bummer. The aftertaste, however, is the best thing here. In total, this gets 2/5 from me.

Bonus point for calling themselves **[Cartel](http://www.cartelcoffeelab.com)** and exporting this from Colombia though. Here's their promo video, which also gets a bonus point, for them including some [Booker T. & The M.G.'s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_T._%26_the_M.G.%27s):

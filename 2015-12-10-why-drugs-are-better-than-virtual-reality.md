The above person is a great workmate, but the above gif merely goes a long way to say that if anyone's into virtual reality glasses, you should use them having stepped as far into the nearest wardrobe as possible, and realise the sheer look of yourself with them on is enough to want to do drugs.

Bar the dangers of doing drugs, you won't look like a twaddle while doing them, as opposed to using these glasses. Thank you.

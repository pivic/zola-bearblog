Wanna make a CD case out of a single sheet of paper? Check the instructions [here](http://www.papercdcase.com). I've tried it and it works very nice.

Also, there's a wine jukebox (...) that's opened in Stockholm. Check a picture and (Swedish) article [here](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=631&a=352672&previousRenderType=1). I'd like to check it out! 10-30SKR for a taste isn't much.

There's a quite major test of different Stockholmian caf√©s [here](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=631&a=225573&previousRenderType=3). I can't say I like Sosta as much as DN (they give them 8/10) does, yet Tintarella Di Luna is really good. I miss a review of W in Kungsholmen though, a place that serves very nice coffee and has won several awards for that.

Go DL a great cover of N.W.A.'s "Straight Outta Compton" by Nina Gordon, right [here](http://www.ninagordon.com/sightsandsounds.html). An acoustic rendition of a hip-hop track has rarely sounded this good. I like Dressy Bessy's cover of Snoop's "Gin 'n' Juice" though.

I'll get an espresso at Pappa Ray Ray before I get home. It's Crime Night on Discovery tonight, and me leeervs it.

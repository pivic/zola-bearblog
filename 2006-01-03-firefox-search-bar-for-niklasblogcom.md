[Here](http://mycroft.mozdev.org/download.html?name=niklasblog&submitform=Search)'s my hack of the day: a Firefox search plugin for this site. So what does it do? If you aren't running [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox), stop reading now, install it and return.

So what's a search bar in Firefox, then? Well, as the caretakers of the search plugin site say: "A search plugin allows you to access a search engine right from your browser. In Mozilla Firefox, you use the search box on the toolbar." If you need pictures to illustrate where it can be found, look [here](http://mycroft.mozdev.org/screenshots.html).

This means you can now replace Google with a more trustworthy and ripe repository for your searches: my site. To install the plugin and make my face turn up in your list of search bars, you'll find it [here](http://mycroft.mozdev.org/download.html?name=niklasblog&submitform=Search).

Was it hard to code? No. Just follow [this easy guide](http://hacks.oreilly.com/pub/h/3033#thread) and it's a snap.

Forge ahead, geek in quest.

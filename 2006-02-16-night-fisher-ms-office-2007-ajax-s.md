I just finished reading "[Night Fisher](http://media.monstersandcritics.com/books/nightfisher_1/images/1560977191.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg "Night Fisher")" by R. Kikou Johnson. I feel the author clearly has combined his own self with the main character's - and it's is a pro, not a con. However, the main character got on my nerves at times by simply being a by-stander in his own life.

The noir-ish feel of the book, the dark surroundings, uncertain futures, the slowness of it all, combined with the sexual undercurrent and being a late teenager on an island is grand. The use of darkness falls into place with this. I also like the way how Johnson has used overlapping captions with unclearly titled wording to portray muddled scenes and unclearness. The book made me think of [Charles Burns](http://www.fantagraphics.com/artist/burns/burns.html) and [Jaime Hernandez](http://www.fantagraphics.com/artist/losbros/jaime.html).

It's nice to see that Office 12 is now having a real name: Office 2007. Microsoft held [a press-conference yesterday](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/feb06/02-15OfficeMoreOptionsPR.mspx) about the suite, the licensing deals and a bit more. They're also saying some about [FrontPage and Expression](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2006/feb06/02-15Designer.mspx), which is interesting if you're into that stuff. Brian Jones, a.k.a. MSXMLMAN, has posted [a few interesting bits on the subject](http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2006/02/15/532998.aspx), where he points out that [Groove](http://www.groove.net) is going to become Office Groove 2007, which will only be available under the Office Enterprise 2007-suite as well as a stand-alone application. I'm anxious to try it out. All the press materials available for Office 2007 are available [here](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/2007office/default.mspx).

I like the idea of AJAX-S. If you haven't heard about AJAX, check [this](http://www.answers.com/AJAX). AJAX-S is a quite simple way to create really quick slide-shows for the web - and you can make them stand-alone, of course. One cool thing is that you can navigate through the slides (or through bullets!) using the arrow-buttons on your keyboard. Check the specifications, the demo and the ZIP'ed demo [here](http://www.robertnyman.com/2005/11/13/proudly-presenting-ajax-s).

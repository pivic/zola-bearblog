[From Slashdot](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/06/05/037201):

> No one seems to have noticed that Sweden is close to passing a far-reaching wiretapping program that would greatly expand the government's spying capabilities by permitting it to monitor all email and telephone traffic coming in and out of the country. If a bill before parliament becomes law, the country's National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) will monitor all internet traffic that passes in or out of the country. As the article notes, there's a good chance email traveling from, say, the UK to Finland would be fair game, since it's likely to traverse through Sweden before reaching it's final destination. So far, there's been nary a peep from Swedish media about the plan.

I think encryption one's communication is going to become more common; that's basically the simplest way to make sure that your Internet data isn't looked through. If you think your data isn't peeked into, take a few minutes to check out what [Project ECHELON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) is all about. It'll most likely be adequate to make you want to check out stuff like [Anonym.OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonym.OS), [how to encrypt your e-mail](http://lifehacker.com/software/top/how-to-encrypt-your-email-180878.php), using [TrueCrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org) to encrypt your hard-drives and [the Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/torbrowser) to surf without anybody knowing who you are.

**update**: Here's the proposition in Swedish, straight outta the governmental site where they try to keep us citizens down using PDF's.

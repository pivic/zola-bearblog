This book was really interesting and humorous, until I spotted this line:

> As she describes in her autobiography, My Lie: A True Story of False Memory, throughout the 1980s, many women accused male family members of sexual abuse only to turn around and recant years later.

Although false reports of rape turn up about as often as lightning strikes humans, that line turned me right off this book. Right off. It's just like finding out there's feces in your food.

Still, I finished this book.

There are quite a few interesting bits in the book for the first fifth of it, but then it veers into quasi-science, with no references to claims made. "Research has been done on," et cetera.

It's sad that the title of the book wasn't truly a misnomer.

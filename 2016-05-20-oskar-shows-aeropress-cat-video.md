My man **Oskar** has finally released a video where he shows the world how to use [the AeroPress coffee maker](http://www.aerobie.com/product/aeropress/), while handling a cat.

However, will Oskar show us what to do with the cat?

I can't say how stoked I am to brew my next cup! Thank you, Oskar!

Do visit [Johan & Nystr√∂m](http://johanochnystrom.se) for more coffee, accessories, tips and a plethora of coffee-and-tea-related stuffs.

Extra fan info on Oskar: he owns a turtle named Malou, which is no doubt named after [**Malou von Sivers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malou_von_Sivers), one of his personal heroes.

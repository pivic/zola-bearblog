WordPress.com has just [opened its doors](http://wordpress.com/signup) to people who want to start blogging using the very latest nightly build of WordPress, my favourite blogging platform of choice. So if you want to get started quickly, this is a very favourable solution, and I'd choose it instantly, if I wasn't hosted by [LivingDot](http://livingdot.com), who have so far served me well.

Microsoft have released [Live Domains](http://domains.live.com), a free service where anybody who administrates the [MX-record](http://www.answers.com/topic/mx-record) of a domain. This means I've now let MS overtake the handling of e-mails for ihatetheusgovernment.com. I log into hotmail.com using my ihatetheusgovernment.com e-mail address and bingo, I've got 250MB's to spend on e-mails and I'm even allowed to hand out 20 e-mail accounts to anybody I wanna spend them on, all free of charge. Thank you, MS.

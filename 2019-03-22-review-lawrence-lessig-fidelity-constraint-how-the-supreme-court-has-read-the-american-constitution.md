The best thing about this book is its author; if you have read Lawrence Lessig before, you will know that his clout in the legal world is substantial and that many persons tend to read his words on matters of justice and privacy.

In this book, he enters the political arena where interpretation meets fidelity, as he delves into the issues involved where the American constitution goes. Lessig quickly dips into the problems that go with trying to interpret a document that is not only hundreds of years old, but also quite inflexible, as most of North America has been bound by it, and still is, in spite of aeons of cycles of modernity having passed.

Lessig draws on legal examples, of early-republic drama where politicians have used the constitution to their own benefit (not uncommonly to thwart opposition), of interpretations that have become legal precendent, and notably, he tells of how the constitution is still being used to, basically, guess what the founding daddies meant.

This book is a strong intellectual claim, quite heavy to read, while being worth it.

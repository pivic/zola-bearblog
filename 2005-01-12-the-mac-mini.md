![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-01-12-bad.gif)I'd love to have the new thing from Apple, a [Mac mini](http://www.apple.com/macmini). It's a quite shrunk version of their Macintosh computer, sold totally without anything but the computer itself. It's not a top-of-the-line Macintosh computer, only with a 40GB (80GB is optional, for an extra $100) hard drive, which I'd like to have never the less. It's a want-thing. When I was little, I often craved new tech stuff, and I'd like to try a Macintosh computer with their "new" operating system over a little period of time. Frederic's had several Mac's, as do others I know, and they often laugh about network problems that frustrate Windows users, the difficulties in moving recently used files (Do you recognise "The file is open. Please close any programs that are using the file, and try again." when attempting to move a file that's definitely not being used?). Anyway, we'll see. It's too expensive right now (appx. 4700SKR while it would cost more than a thousand crowns less if somebody living in the USA would buy it for me).

And yes, I haven't received my telephone from Engstr√∂m Telecom yet. How wonderous! I think I believe Special K's prediction about wild elephants having trampled the sucker to death. Now a shower, then bed-time! I've carried over 300 computers today, so I'm knackered.

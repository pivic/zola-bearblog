**I'm not convinced**. I really _want_ to be convinced, but...according to the horrid tabloid named The Daily Mail, [the Ripper is Aaron Kosminski](http://kottke.org/14/09/jack-the-rippers-identity-revealed). Well. Until an independent source says yes, I'll try to stay reserved. From the linked article:

> Russell Edwards recently bought a shawl allegedly tied to one of the killings. After DNA testing, the shawl was shown not only to have the victim's blood on it but also semen from the alleged perpetrator, hairdresser [Aaron Kosminski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Kosminski).

But I'm still really interested in this. It's not as though [Patricia Cornwell cracked this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_a_Killer:_Jack_the_Ripper%E2%80%94Case_Closed), neither was he [James Maybrick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Ripper_suspects#James_Maybrick) - I think. Until we know more, it's in the air.

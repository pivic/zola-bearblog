[![Edith Sitwell by Cecil Beaton](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/3423609_668_800.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/3423609_668_800.jpg)

[**Edith Sitwell**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Sitwell) was a milestone among early 20th-century eccentrics. Here are her own words on her personal appearance and style:

Now, _that's_ the fucking impression I'd people to try and make.

> The trouble with most Englishwomen is that they will dress as if they had been a mouse in a previous incarnation they do not want to attract attention.

Naturally, that goes for all genders.

So, apropos nothing, what were Sitwell's thoughts on Marilyn Monroe?

Upon meeting Marilyn Monroe, Edith Sitwell called her a daffodil. I wonder what Morrissey thinks of Monroe.

Two more quotes from Sitwell:

> My personal hobbies are reading, listening to music, and silence.

> I am one of those unhappy persons who inspire bores to the greatest flights of art.

Everybody who have heard Morrissey speak may imagine his chuckles as he's read her.

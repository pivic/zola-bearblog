I went to the sale at DVDirect today, or rather, Mikaela drove me in her grandmother's scary little gold-coloured [Hyundai Athos](http://worldwide.hyundai-motor.com/cybermall/showroom/passenger/atos/index.html). Well there, [I found a few films](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-09-11-films.jpg), among them [the Criterion release](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=21) of [David Cronenberg](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000343)'s "[Dead Ringers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094964)", at a mere 280SKR. A find!

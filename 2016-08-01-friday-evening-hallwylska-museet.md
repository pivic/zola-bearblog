OK, the above pic is from the [Ling Long](http://www.dn.se/pa-stan/ata-ute/ling-long-loper-risk-att-bli-so-long) bar, which is sort of the outdoors anteroom to Story Hotel. It's fresh, has good staff and great drinks. The above cocktails were very good. Haven't had a Manhattan in ages.

The above - and below - pictures are from the restaurant at [Hallwylska Museet](http://www.hallwylska.com), where we happily sat during Friday evening.

I still think it strange to sit outdoors and not freeze off; I even had a sleeveless shirt on without an issue.

The entrée. Roasted cauliflower, very nice. The environment just made everything a lot better. Rapping throughout the evening, making the work week disappear. It was sweet.

The ending: it was lovely, as well, paired with espresso. Our wine was a substitute for the one we selected, so we got a more expensive one. Which was really good (in taste)! The staff was nice and quick, the decór was simple and nice, and the place itself... The DJ was great to watch, doing weird spins to his EDM.

All in all: lovely.

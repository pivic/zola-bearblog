I dreamt I was in an English pub. A girl looking very much like Meg from The White Stripes was there, with a man in a bowler hat. I asked him if he had a light. He turned around and was Jack White. I was shocked. They saw I recognised them, and looked like "Oh no, not a fan". I told them they looked as if they'd seen a fan, and they laughed. They confirmed they were The White Stripes, as I lit a cigar (I don't smoke in real life) and told them their new album had shocked me more than their appearence at this English little pub. They said they were glad I liked but "Hold on", Jack said, "is it out on the Internet already?" They both eagerly awaited my response: "Yes, it's out. But if it makes you happy, most people I know will buy it." They looked fine with this, but apparently didn't know a vinyl rip has been plastered over the 'net.

"So, what do you think of it?", Meg asked. "Well, I think most people will think it's a downer since it's not like 'Elephant' but then again, when has the largest number of people been right of recent?" I replied. I really don't think I would have said that in real life. I continued: "I think it's good. It's basic, good song-writing , and shows you can do stuff that's unexpected of you. The marimbas in song two are good, and the piano in the foreground is good. The bass is good. I like it. It reminds me a bit of Beck's 'Sea Change'. If your previous albums have been four-to-the-floor, this one's hard-core in comparison."

"Well, much obliged", Jack said, looking confounded. In my dream, they represented the sort of country-ish twisted parody that Jack uses for lingo on his journal at The White Stripes' web-site. I remembered something here. "Oh wait!" I said. They looked even more as if they wanted me to leave this time. "I just wondered, could I have my picture taken with you?" I asked. "Sure", they both said. Here, I discovered I didn't have my (dream) Nikon D70, and I didn't even have a mobile phone camera. Darn that, then. I thanked them, wished them good luck with their new album and woke up.

Prologue: after I woke up, I made a piece of toast and found a picture of me with the band on it! AAH! I sold it on eBay and became a millionaire. No I didn't.

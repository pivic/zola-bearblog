Today marks the first fall of snow in Stockholm. At least that I know of!

During lunch today I helped an old, overweight lady who'd fallen on a patch of ice. She was sitting on the patch, calmly looking around her as I asked if I could help her up. She said yes, and I somehow managed to get her up despite wearing rubber-soled Converse shoes which I totally attribute to my extremely muscular body.

This belongs to my colleague Magnus who is into bears, alcohol and hard rock.

Said colleague. Do note his chocolate santa in front. Have you ever seen anybody looking this concentrated?

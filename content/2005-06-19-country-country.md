Last night I visited Muma's parents' small country place. This is really grand over-exaggeration as his parents' little house consists of one room and stands on a patch of land big enough to make two dwarves feel crowded. Anyway, it was nice to meet the fairly static flock of people that always meet up when Muma holds this kind of event. I haven't met Kim in ages. He's a very nice guy, bright and smart, who's now on a quest to find ICO, one of the best games I've ever played; [it's even voted #1](http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/september03/25underrated/index26.shtml) in a "The 25 most underrated games of all time" roll. Until then, he'll stay fixed on NHL 200x.

Another interesting part of the meet was somebody I didn't recognise. I said hello to a girl who seemed happy, yet didn't seem to be paling it up with anybody at the place. Fair enough, I asked her if she knew Muma. "Yes, through the Internet", she said. "Aah, at SKOM?" I asked. She looked as if I'd said something really weird. "Oh, that's an electronic community that Muma and I got to know each-other from," I explained. She added that she got to know Muma through [Spray Date](http://spraydate.spray.se). Oh, really? I hope they make it, even though they spent a minimal amount of time together at the shindig. I've always been interested in Muma's snide remarks about women; I don't think I've ever heard him comment a woman as being cool in any way. They're always too fat or bitches. When mutual friends have got together with somebody new, he's quick to point out their "short-comings", i.e. anything he can comment on as being wrong. Hence, it's fun to see his date wasn't skinny at all, but rather a little pudgy. I hope his views on women develop along the right track.

I drank a bottle of red wine, and then a little more out of a bag-in-boxer, so believe me when I say it was my kung fu-reflexes that saved me from getting completely fubar when I slipped in the wet grass. I got myself a really cold and wet side of leg though, and the crowd a show.

Aah, vacation. Tomorrow's the first day in Mikaela's and my one month-long vacation. I'll be cherishing every second of it. I love long vacations. I wouldn't want to have a mere two weeks in a row, a long time's the trick for letting one's work-pulse tick down to a great relaxing one. Then you'll tackle work, after the vacation.

And a funny thing: thanks to the over-exposure of [Chicago](http://www.chicagotheband.com/index1.htm)'s "[If You Leave Me Now](http://www.romantic-lyrics.com/li9.shtml)" because of its inclusion in a very popular Swedish mobile phone TV-ad, Mikaela's been singing it all day, oh-no-ing herself for letting it control her mind. Go, go, go! I can't say I'm unaffected though. "Woo-hoo-hooooo, please---AAARGH!" Happens every five minutes or so.

Oh, thanks to my job I've been handed a new laptop. It's another IBM, this time an [R51](http://www-131.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=-840&storeId=10000001&langId=-1&dualCurrId=1000073&categoryId=2302836) model. Very nice, especially the wireless internet capabilities that allow me to sneak bandwidth off my next-door neighbour. Well, in a couple of months' time, I'll buy a wireless ADSL-router. Wee!

That's from today, when I tried some [Honolulu Coffee](http://www.honolulucoffee.com), to be exact, an espresso from the blend "USBC #1" that garnered said company the Silver at the 2011 World Barista Championships.

There'll be some jazz playing at 1pm at Drop Coffee tomorrow and Sunday too. A mini-festival of jazz and some of the best coffee blends in the world? You can't beat that touch. ((Personally I nearly loathe that type of jazz, but the coffee lifted me beyond.))

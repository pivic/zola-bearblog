Here's the tracklist off the coming "Under The Influence" compilation by Super Furry Animals:

\* Beach Boys - Feel Flows \* Undertones - My Perfect Cousin \* Datblygu - Casserole Efeillaid \* Gorky's Zygotic Mynci - Christina \* Sly And The Family Stone - Family Affair \* Dawn Penn - You Don't Love Me (No No No) \* ELO - Telephone Lines \* Dennis Wilson And Rumbo - Lady \* Meic Stevens - Ghost Town \* MC5 - Kick Out The Jams \* Bizet - Pearl Fishers \* Underworld - Rez \* Humanoid - Stakker Humanoid \* Joey Beltram - Energy Flash \* Hardfloor - Acperience

Wow! I mean, "Energy Flash"? Wouldn't have thought it. Only one reggae track? Opera! Which version of the "Pearl Fishers", I wonder. Well, it's hard to just compile ONE CD. I mean, Zak and I have tried to compile a double CD each, our very own UTI's, and it's not yet happened. Of course I'd mix old tracks, Front 242, Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, and new ones, maybe Franz Ferdinand, maybe...or...or. That's the problem! I gotta get off those "beaten paths" and get to it.

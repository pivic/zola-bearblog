[According to The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/oct/16/greatest-films-of-all-time), the below are "The Greatest Films of All Time". Of course. In three genres: romance, crime and comedy. You can click the tabs at the bottom left corner of the spreadsheet to switch genres.

Any thoughts on the innards?

Speaking for myself, I hadn't even heard about Richard Linklater's "_Before Sunrise_" or "_Before Sunset_" before seeing this list, and I still haven't seen "_Harold & Maude_" by Hal Ashby, a film that I've been hassled by almost everyone to see for ages. And no, haven't seen anything by Wong Kar Wai.

I have, however, not been a complete philistine lurking in a cave. I've been lurking in _two_ caves.

Roman Polanski's "_Rosemary's Baby_" is forever one of my horror-faves, and I love his "_Chinatown_" [as written by the notable Robert Towne](http://www.weeklyscript.com/Chinatown.txt). "_The Exorcist_" and "_The Shining_" are also grand titles for the horror list I'll say, and I think the latter ranks as my fave scary film.

I'm glad to see both "_Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_" and "_Lost in Translation_" by Michel Gondry and Sofia Coppola, respectively, as two modern romance-classics. Among the oldies, sure I'll go with "_Roman Holiday_", but why not "_To Have and Have Not_"? I mean, "_The Big Sleep_" is listed in the crime-category, but. But!

I can't see how "_Rushmore_" can be rated so high in the comedy-category when "_Groundhog Day_" is oh-so-below. "_Team America: World Police_" is a great pick and "_Dazed and Confused_", I love it!

Speaking of which, here's a run-down of a list of [my Facebook friends' fave Stanley Kubrick](https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=question&id=10150126788366236) films, ranking from the absolute fave at the top and it thereafter trickles down:

Anyhow, The Guardian's list is in my opinion a bit dated, containing the usual critic's faves; here it is:

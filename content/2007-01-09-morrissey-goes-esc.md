It just seems [Morrissey could be spear-heading England for the Eurovision Song Contest](http://music.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1986241,00.html). I first saw this covered in The Sun, which means I didn't think more of it, but now that The Guardian cover it...I still don't believe it; nothing would surprise me less though, the man's got aces up his sleeves!

> There is one question that I keep on asking: 'why didn't they ask me?' That question keeps going round my head.

Antony Hegarty speaks about bombastic Turkish artist Selda and also about the Internet, and ties it up regarding revolutions. Check the entire article [here](http://www.pitchfork.com/news/42890-5-10-15-20-antony), and here's my fave quote:

> The artist I've been listening to more than anybody else is Selda, the Turkish singer. I think she's considered a revolutionary singer-- she was in a lot of political trouble for a number of years, she's kind of like the voice of the people. It's almost like she's crying. It reminds me of reading something that Marc Almond said when I was 12 years old: "I don't care if I hit the notes, it's the feeling that matters." It's such a daring and different thing to say. The music press was always criticizing him for being out of tune, and all that mattered to him was the feeling. The thing with Selda is that her voice exists within the wave of emotion in her voice.
> 
> I feel like revolutionary music is really important right now and I wish I could participate. The stakes are really high. I was asked to come and sing at the TED conference, and my music went down a lead pipe. I was like, "Well, all of you guys are talking about developments and how you can throw your Apple dollars at problems, and you're too afraid to talk about the big picture." I'm excited about Selda because of what she did. I can't get the translations, but whatever it is that she's singing, we have to participate. We can't just get hypnotized in the little culture bubbles provided for us by these multi-national corporations.
> 
> The Internet might be useful for creating revolution, but all it's creating in the Western world is more passivity, more disconnection. It's a fucking nightmare. When I was 20 years old in New York City, do you think you walked into a coffee shop and saw 40 people staring at $2,000 purchases all made from the same company? And those are all the artists! I talk to young musicians now, and they're just happy to be making records that get released. They don't even consider that, in the old days, they could making a living by selling records. They don't even get paid for their work. All that money just goes to Apple and they're happy to just have people going to their shows. It just took two generations for Apple and similar companies to convince artists they don't deserve to get paid and that they should just be grateful for the tools that Apple is providing us to make our work, as if we need them to make our art. It's very, very fucked up.

> I've stopped using the Internet, basically. I text, but I've whittled that down. I'm trying to just revert to a landline. I don't want to live in computer time. The Internet doesn't care if we've had enough.

Here's some fantastic Selda for you, the great track "_Ince Ince_":

This past weekend has been lovely indeed. Today I'm sitting up but last Friday I was food-poisoned. Rat-gutted, lying-on-the-floor impaled, pain streaming up and down through my body like a burning spear of liquids, and I shan't say more. Let's just say I'll never dine at [Ballbreaker](http://www.ballbreaker.se) at GÃ¤rdet again. It was fun going out with my dear colleagues though!

Having done that, my Saturday was quite the opposite. Having made some - and I may say so myself - lovely [rocky road](http://www.recept.nu/1.126537/leila_lindholm/efterratter_godis/leilas_rocky_road), tidied up the apartment, smashed a bit of "_[Christmas Cocktails](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-lounge_(album_series))_" on the stereo and got into xmas mode with my lovely wife and our esteemed mini-xmas guests, Maylinn and Criz.

We ate a lot of stuff, exchanged gifts and had a nice time. Blixa made a surprise entrance a) charming everybody and b) climbing the guests' outer-garments so she could get up onto the hat rack. Fetched her down twice and she climbed into bed and slept away. She does that nowadays, little critter. She's getting old - we just forgot about celebrated her second birthday! And they said she wouldn't live through the end of my patience.

Watched "_[The Wrestler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wrestler_(2008_film))_" by Aronovsky. It actually surprised me, although Mickey Rourke didn't; I figured he'd be really good in that film. I loved how the camera followed him from his back so often.

Yesterday was very calm. And tonight's the rush for xmas presents! I'm going out to find something sweet for my love.

Looking into my frosty world from the snowy roof at work everything's serene. People walking with their kids tucked into carts, their arms sticking out without any aid. Kids in sleds. Grown-ups tucked into quadruply glazed all-around body-protecting overalls. Everywhere, serenity and cold. _The arctic cold_, as some Swedish tabloids judge it to be. Arctic. As if things haven't been this bad every year around. There's no arctic bit about this. No polar bears, unless I'm mistaken. And still, the tabloids either publish how "arctic" we're doing, or something from their inevitable and incessant pile of quasi-materials regarding weight-gain/loss. Oh, mother me. But instead of ranting on about that, go (if you use Google Chrome as your web browser of choice) [here](http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/p/cause/) and install Chrome for a Cause. Google will donate money for every new tab you create using Chrome. Now, that's doing something rather than reading idiot pages.

Or just marvel at why you marvel at the cold.

![Turnmills](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-02-29-turnmills.jpg)Apparently Turnmills - the legendary venue in London that's hosted everything from the Heavenly Social club (where The Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim found fame), to bouncing masterpiece club Together - [is now closing](http://www.turnmills.co.uk/finalweekend/eflyers.html). To celebrate this, they're having a final weekend, where the usual suspects mentioned above are DJ'ing on the same night. Of course, it's sold out. I just found out. Sadness in my eyes.

[![All Tomorrow's Parties Festival - Explosions ATP](http://img.skitch.com/20080227-xjwtgt11y47bb2127ejgjne3s1.preview.jpg)](http://skitch.com/pivic/gnyn/all-tomorrows-parties-festival-explosions-atp)  

I can't say I'm very sore about it, as X and I are going to [All Tomorrow's Parties as curated by Explosions In The Sky](http://www.atpfestival.com/events/explosions). It's sold out as well, even though we've got tickets. I can't say how happy I am about this. Just check out the roster and explode. Okkervil River rubbing shoulders with Saul Williams? Dinosaur Jr. with De La Soul? Four Tet and Liars? AAH!

And X just let me know that Band of Horses are coming to [Accelerator 2008](http://www.last.fm/event/528695), that's going down in the end of June. We planned on going to see [them on Thursday here in Stockholm](http://www.last.fm/event/408775), but as the gig sold out early and - _breaking news_: we're farking going. I placed an ad on Blocket ((A major Swedish site for buying and selling stuff.)) and just three days before the gig a guy called to sell me two tickets at the price he bought them for. Massive.

Just too bad we're iller than most; both X and I have sore throats, headache and - to paraphrase Withnail - I feel like somebody shat in my head. No, I'm not hung-over. I'm beat, but not down. I will see Band of Horses.

By the way, an acquaintance just informed me that [Sparks](http://www.allsparks.com) are playing 21 dates in London, to celebrate the release of their 21st album. They'll play a different album each night. Apparently, "Kimono My House" is sold out. "Propaganda" is still on, though. Still, it collides with ATP, even though I'd love to see Sparks live again.

A lot of gigs are planned, a lot will be loved. And there's [Way Out West](http://www.wayoutwest.se) to consider...

Rade came over after work yesterday, so we watched a bit of the so-and-so "animated reality series" called "[Drawn Together](http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/drawntogether)". It's basically a series of skits with some type of theme loosely attempting binding them all together. The characters are parodies of known cartoons. My absolute favourite is [Ling-Ling](http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/drawntogether/bios.jhtml?b=3), the "Asian trading-card battle monster", quite similar to Pikachu. You don't like it? [Kill it](http://www.newgrounds.com/assassin/pokemon)! It was so-so, but contained an NBA skit which I was meant to show Rade before assassinating on.

So we've reached the play-offs of the season, and we're the Indiana Pacers. So which team do we meet? Yep. The effing Detroit Pistons. The gas-guzzlers of car-town. We won the first game but barely, lost the second and (after a quick re-meet thanks to the rejuvenating boost of the morale of our team (in turn, thanks to us being able to reload the last lost game)) kicked their asses. It was wonderful. Meeting New Jersey after that felt like a walk in the park, without stepping on poo.

So we're due for a couple of games more before we claim the title again. Boring, you say? Hell no. Come next pay, I intend to get myself a little network expansion card which means Rade and I will be battling faces from Antarctica to Arctica all over the web. Now back to how white I am...

The computer table was an utter success. Our carpenter is one of very few service-people I actually fully trust. Everything he's done so far, both for Frederic (who tipped us about him) and us, has been very well done. Now it's only a matter painting the table.

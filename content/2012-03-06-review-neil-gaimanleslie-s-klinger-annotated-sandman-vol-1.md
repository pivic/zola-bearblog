[![Annotated Sandman Vol. 1](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1320490845m/12101436.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12101436) [Annotated Sandman Vol. 1](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12101436) by [Leslie S. Klinger](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/43322)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/255387018)  
  
This is a black-and-white first volume of the first 20 issues of "The Sandman", an epic series written by Neil Gaiman.

Leslie S. Klinger has annotated this volume, and will annotate the rest as well. The annotations range from historical - e.g. information on William Shakespeare's name and the versions of it - to clerical, the arcane but foremost the explanative, i.e. sorting out everything that surrounds The Sandman canon, i.e. the characters, the places and places.

My first edition actually contained some misshapes, e.g. blackened annotations and huge smudges, but apart from that the binding is sublime. The fact that this book is in black-and-white - the original versions being in colour - just brings the annotations more to the front, in my eye.

Although Klinger's "annotated Sherlock Holmes" is much more interesting to me personally, especially considering its extreme depth, breadth and plethora, this book is definitely worth its money and I'm eagerly looking forward to the second volume.

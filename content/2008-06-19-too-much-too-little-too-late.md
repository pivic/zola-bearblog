Nobody's told me this track's a bleeding cover! I've been busy prancing around thinking [Silver Sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Sun_(band)) made the original, but hell to the no - it's a guy called [Johnny Mathis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Mathis) who (featuring Deniece Williams) made it a #1 Billboard hit in 1978.

Here are the two versions, and hearing the oldie warped my fragile little mind.

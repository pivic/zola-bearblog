Listening to [](http://laserbeast.com)[Lightning Bolt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning%20Bolt%20%28band%29) requires a certain mindset for me. Like Morrissey once said, "the music that they constantly play/it says nothing to me about my life". Well, Lightning Bolt does say a lot to me even though I can't hear most of what Brian Chippendale is singing ((Which is very similar to my relationship with Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, the difference being that I don't understand German.))!

Normally I would laud a band simply for breaking boundaries and norms, but the music that these two guys play is so good that I can't imagine living without it. Granted, I don't like much of what they've done before their fourth album, "**[Hypermagic Mountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermagic%20Mountain)**", but they've earned an integral bit of my heart for creating very dense, extremely drum-filled and drone-melodic songs. The distorted singing and their unique stage-approach warms me up even more. Their music primitively pin-points and hits some sort of "hard-core feel", as [Ari Up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari%20Up) would put it.

Their new album, "**[Earthly Delights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthly_Delights_%28album%29)**", is released 2009-10-13, which means it's time to [pre-order it from Load Records](http://www.loadrecords.com)!

Here's a nicely shot and edited little video that features bits of old songs but also part of "_Sound Guardians_", the track I'd first recommend off their new LP - which is at the time of writing available for a listen [here](http://hypem.com/track/895581/Lightning+Bolt+-+Sound+Guardians).

[Here](http://revision3.com/xlr8rtv/lbsr/)'s a nice little video thing where Lightning Bolt is compared with [Sun Ra Arkestra](http://www.last.fm/music/Sun%2BRa "Sun Ra"), a more jazzy but equally experimental and searching sort of band.

The third track off their coming album is called "_Colossus_" and appears here courtesy of Load Records. It's a notably slow track, for being Lightning Bolt:

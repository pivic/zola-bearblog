[As the BBC reports](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3753830.stm), singles don't sell anymore. Could downloads be replacing single sales? Elton John sold a hefty number of million singles courtesy of Diana's death. Maybe Eric Prydz would have done a lot better, had his "Call On Me" been, say, a shout-out or a requiem for Anna Lindh, the murdered Swedish minister?

I want to see statistics regarding this! Are people more single-purchase-prone if there's death involved, and/or sorrow?

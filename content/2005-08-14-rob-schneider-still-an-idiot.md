Check out [this old post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=461) of mine, and then check out [this post](http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/deucebigaloweuropeangigolo) courtesy of Metacritic, and realise everybody hates Rob Schneider - or rather, his latest film, but what's the difference, anyway?

[Roger Ebert](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com) kills him with one line, which you'll understand when you've read said old post:

> Speaking in my official capacity as a Pulitzer Prize winner, Mr. Schneider, your movie sucks.

I've read a lot of stuff in 2010! 52 books all in all, but that's including pamphlets and short-stories; I've re-visited the Sherlockian canon by [Arthur Conan Doyle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle) and hence blown through a lot of stuff. I've finally read through [the tome by Leslie S. Klinger](http://www.lesliesklinger.com/index.html) but also found a lot of treats. By the way, you'll find my book interests at [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com); [here's my profile](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2106358).

My #1 hit is [Bengt Jangfeldt](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengt_Jangfeldt)'s epic biography on [Majakovsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir%20Mayakovsky), as I've reviewed [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5432). Then, discovering who is my #2 favourite poet of all time ((#1 remains [Arthur Rimbaud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%20Rimbaud).)) - [Emily Dickinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily%20Dickinson) - is completely mind-blowing.

Other than sheer fiction, buying the collected volumes of "The Paris Review Interviews" is money well-spent. The interviews are conducted by sharp well-read minds with a bunch of very interesting, human, non-human, funny, chilling, angry, mind-molesting and enslaved objects, spanning more than 50 years of knowledge, culture and foremost, a unique vision into the minds of authors that are to be revered. My review of the first volume is found [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5510).

Music books: [Patti Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti%20Smith)'s "[Just Kids](https://niklasblog.com/?p=518)" races beyond the others, simply because of the tone of her literal voce. It's like silk intertwined with the most gentle of barbed wire, coated with honey and piss. Heaven and hell. I've reviewed it in full [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5184).

Second, [Nick Kent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick%20Kent)'s "[Apathy For The Devil](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5177)", his recollection of the 1970s, is a great book following his growing up until getting off drugs for good. In the mean-time, he falls in love with music, women and mind-bending substances of different weights. I've reviewed it [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5177), complete with Spotify playists of Kent's recommendations - including his comment on my post!

There's really much more to be said, but I shan't. Read on about the books from the top that I've reviewed, e.g. Alice Munro's [Too Much Happiness](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5693), åsa Ericsdotter's "[Kräklek](https://niklasblog.com/?p=4533)" and definitely not least, "[The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5297)".

What follows below is a list ordered by score (1-10) from the highest accolade at the top to the lowest of the low at the bottom.

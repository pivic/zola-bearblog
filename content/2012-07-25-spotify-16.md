A little Spotify-playlist of mine, mixing all from the two first neo-psychedelic tracks by The Brian Jonestown Massacre and Thee Oh Sees, to Kelly Hogan covering The Magnetic Fields, Goose's magnificent electronics house masterpiece "Synrise", a supreme new instrumental soundtrack-maker from Iceland named Johann Johannsson and it's all gift-wrapped by Blur ending it all.

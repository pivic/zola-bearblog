As Blixa's continually growing up her fights with Lotta get more equal; granted, they currently don't fight as nasty as they did a few months ago, and the fights often end with Lotta's slapping Blixa to sanity, but still, it's a mess. Here's a little video of what that looks like, filmed on Caturday:

Today X and I walked to Skarpn√§ck, which was really nice. We met a couple of [Chinese Crested dogs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese%20Crested%20Dog), who behaved like this:

Since I was little and started loving cats, I thought dogs to be non-individuals, i.e. quite stupid followers while I viewed cats more as entities that don't give a toss about most things in life, i.e. leaders. Well, things have changed since then. As X's got me interested in dogs, I got her interested in cats. I'm guessing in a few years, we'll have a _big_ apartment with one or two [American Hairless Terriers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20Hairless%20Terrier) to keep Blixa and Lotta on their toes - as if that's necessary.

Finally, here's a picture of Timmy, one of the two Chinese Crested dogs in the video above. 11 years old and so sweet. Click the pic to see a bigger version.

And I can't go on without including a little pic of Blixa that I snapped this Friday; I love [the new camera](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0807/08072102panasoniclx3.asp):

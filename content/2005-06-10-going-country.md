In an hour or so, I'll be heading to Tor√∂, a very little country-side island a little bit outside of Stockholm. The goal? To hang around with my colleagues and watch video. Films I've selected! They have no idea of what they're going to see, and it'll be a mix of all types of videos except for totally experimental stuff. I wish I had Chris Cunningham's "[Rubber Johnny](http://www.rubberjohnny.tv)" though.

A colleague has tipped me about [this BBC site](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/beethoven/downloads.shtml), from where you can download Beethoven's nine symphonies, for the week after they're broadcast. They're only available for a few days more, so go for it!

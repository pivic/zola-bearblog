First, there's now [this interactive timeline](http://www.motherjones.com/bush_war_timeline) built in Flash, showing how the Bush-led American government has lied from 1990 through 2003. As if that wasn't enough, you'll find this singular film, culled from a collection of videos led by [Amanda Lear](http://amandalear.tripod.com), titelled "Cocktail d'amour" which [apparently went on circa 2002-2003](http://groups.msn.com/FansofAmandaLear/general.msnw?action=get_message&mview=1&ID_Message=5253).

The embedded film is snagged from said show, which I recently transferred from VHS to DVD, and shows a bit from Amanda's show as broadcast by RAI, an Italian TV-network, nowadays owned by [Silvio Berlusconi](https://niklasblog.com/?p=256). Even though the contents of the video has nothing directly to do with Amanda (and is less mad than Berlusconi is), you'll find a woman dressed up as a cat, followed by a man who wears a kitty face-mask, meowing incessantly, while cat-related cartoons roll in the background. Enjoy it, if you can; consider that a warning, and don't blame me for any trauma caused by it.

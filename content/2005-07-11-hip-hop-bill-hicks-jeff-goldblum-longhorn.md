I'm going to invest in [this](http://www.cantstopwontstop.com) book by Jeff Chang, called "Can't Stop Won't Stop", which is about how hip-hop came to (counting from the 60's to the turn of the millennium). Could be good.

Also, don't miss [this site that brings you Bill Hicks-bootlegs](http://web.archive.org/web/20040610023004/privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~adrisc/speed/bill2.htm), which is something I really must push for. It's a bit crowded at times, that server, but stay vigilent and you'll get pay-off.

Hey, did you know that [Jeff Goldblum's into watching you poop](http://www.jeffgoldblumiswatchingyoupoop.com)? Don't forget to pick up [the flyers](http://www.jeffgoldblumiswatchingyoupoop.com/pages/flyers.html) and put them up in every rest-room available.

The next version of Windows is soon up for beta testing, and there are (since long) screen-shots available of what that will look like. [Here](http://www.phoenixrealm.com/wp-gal/longhorn/desktop/lh10.png)'s a view of how funky folders look, not to mention it looks as if Paint has undergone some sort of code-shuffling; also note the opacity of the windows. It's interesting to see how Internet Explorer is undergoing [its first real transformation](http://www.phoenixrealm.com/wp-gal/longhorn/desktop/lh4.png), mostly because of [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html), I guess, pushing the borders for how a really useful web-browser should behave. I don't think those tabs would have popped up in IE, unless Firefox would have done it first. It's nice to see that Microsoft are [becoming more graphic in detailing](http://www.phoenixrealm.com/wp-gal/longhorn/desktop/lh7.png). This operating system will probably see the light of day in a year. It's going to feature [RSS integration](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/rss/default.aspx), a new [user experience](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/ux/default.aspx) and [higher security](http://software.silicon.com/security/0,39024655,39123859,00.htm), MS claims.

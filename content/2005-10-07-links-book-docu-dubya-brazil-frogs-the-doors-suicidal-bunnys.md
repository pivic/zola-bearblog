I've just received a copy of "[The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=niklasblog-20&creative=9325&path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393327655)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)", a very interesting book that I caught wind of while watching "[The God Who Wasn't There](http://imdb.com/title/tt0455507)". Apparently, the book will explain why we should be suspecting the steps of people who are too faith-based. A very recent post from the author, Sam Harris, is available [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/there-is-no-god-and-you-_b_8459.html). Writing about people who are (or pretend to be) faith-based...Dubya! [Did _God_ tell him to invade Iraq, or not](http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1587122,00.html)?

Something those fools should look at, is Brazil. The nation will soon be voting on a very urgent matter: [Should the sale of all types of guns and ammunition be banned nationwide for everyone except the police and military?](http://www.courant.com/news/nationworld/hc-brazil1002.artoct03,0,6151462.story?coll=hc-headlines-nationworld). Good one! I can see only one problem: what will the children in the gutter use to fight when the police and military comes to massacre them some more?

[Frog dissection done electronically](http://news.com.com/2300-11395_3-5890118-1.html?part=cnet&tag=feed_2501&subj=ns_5890118)? Yeay, American students!

It's nice to see all musicians aren't greedy bastards. [The former Doors-drummer](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/10/05/doors_drummer_wont_a.html) for one. Said drummer "allow Doors' songs to be used in TV commercials". Check the URL to the BoingBoing-article.

You wanna see suicidal bunnies? [Go ahead](http://people.freenet.de/schnubelken/bunnys).

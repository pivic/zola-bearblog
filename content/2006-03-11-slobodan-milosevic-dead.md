Quite the turn of events, [Slobodan Milosevic was found dead in his cell a few hours ago](http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/03/11/129309-slobodan-milosevic-found-dead-in-cell), 64 years old. Since long having complained of heart-problems, his trial has many times been postponed.

I'm guessing the Haag tribunal will now go after [Ratko Mladic](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1423551.stm) even harder.

While [compulsive hoarding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsive_hoarding) is often confined to things, some people hoard animals. The video clip below shows a person who has hoarded 130 cats in her two-room apartment. Horrific. Beyond damaged, but then again, this woman is too sick to realise it and do something about it.

All one can do is keep an eye out and be quick about notifying the proper authorities about it. As cats are territorial by nature, many argue that keeping more than one cat in an apartment isn't really good for the animals as they'll start competing with no real way of solving the problem, which just vexes the cats and poisons the situation further.

 Kudos to [Mattias](http://melm.tumblr.com) for the tip.

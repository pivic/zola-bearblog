I've since long been fond of The Maccabees. They were very good at the Accelerator festival in Stockholm and [Felix White is still an amphetamine god](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/686851084), but this trifle of a video says it all really, jangly guitar and fantastic singing intertwined with a strong melody:

Apparently, [cheese-rolling in Gloucestershire is tradition](http://www.cheese-rolling.co.uk). Broken bones seems like such fun here. I have to say, I adore the song and the video, even though it's acetate in nature; I think it'll hold for a few listens only. I can't help but cheer the star on, to see how it all pans out for him and smile at his smiling at the end.

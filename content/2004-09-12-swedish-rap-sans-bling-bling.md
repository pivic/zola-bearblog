Skiiteri is a Swedish rap group where members focus on real lyrics. They come from different backgrounds, with a common platform: their families come from abroad, countries where the population have felt politics in everyday life, much unlike what most middle-class Swedes feel. Sweden hasn't been actively involved in wars for a very long time (if one excludes the fact that the Swedish government horse-traded with the nazis during WWII) which means most youths I've come across don't care about politics at all. This is why I like groups like Skiiteri, that don't care for bling bling-groups, who actively seem to question "facts" and go for a vice-grip on politics. [Here](http://www.ekuriren.se/sjudagar/artikel.php?id=286965&avdelning_1=110&avdelning_2=147#)'s a Swedish article on them, and [here](http://www.ekuriren.se/file_arkiv/skiter2.mp3) is a link to one of their songs \[160Kbps MP3\].

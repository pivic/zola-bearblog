Since I'm really anxious to get hold of every little bit Morrisseyish, here's a snippet from a Morrissey newsletter for you:

> Morrissey's new single, "You Have Killed Me," is now available for download at the iTunes Music Store as well as on [Rhapsody](http://www.rhapsody.com/album?albumId=9391360), where you can also listen to "I Will See You In Far Off Places" for the first time.
> 
> If you haven't yet seen the video for "You Have Killed Me", you will find it [here](http://music.aol.com/artist/main.adp?artistid=107617).

Observe: even if you don't watch Morrissey's Italian cheese-ball video, you must hear "I Will See You In Far Off Places". It's that good.

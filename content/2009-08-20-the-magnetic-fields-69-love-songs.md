This is truly a wonderful and quite singular entry in the canon of pop; [Stephin Merritt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephin_Merritt) is the name of the man who has written this album himself and is on this triple-CD album helped to perform it together with the rest of the group that make [The Magnetic Fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnetic_Fields); the first time I tried to get into this band was actually by listening to spots of this album, but I quickly dissed them. I thought they sounded way too arty, that they sounded as if they were trying too hard and that the album was produced really badly. Well, it's not too late to change, is it?

Here's "_Nothing Matters When We're Dancing_", with Stephin Merritt on vocals.

The album _isn't_ very well produced, but just as with Manic Street Preachers' "[The Holy Bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holy_Bible_%28album%29 "The Holy Bible (album)")", there's a punk rock charm about it, and besides, I have a feeling that it's not the point: the songs themselves are the message. So ditch any thoughts you may have about [Brian Eno](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian%2BEno "Brian Eno"), Phil Spector and their likes, and just concentrate on the innards of this beast.

As the album title suggests, it's [69 pieces of audio, all about love](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_Love_Songs), most of which threw me off the scent the first time around. As an example, the very first song of the album, "_Absolutely Cuckoo_", lets the listener be warned that the singer will become completely infatuated with you and go cuckoo, and there's no telling what his friends'll do if the love-interest should fall through. It pretty much got me on track, learning to expect nothing but rather take it all in.

Here's "_Absolutely Cuckoo_", also with Stephin Merritt on vocals.

From simple, slow songs ("_I Don't Believe in the Sun_", "_Papa Was a Rodeo_"), to complex guitar-pieces ("_Acoustic Guitar_", "_Come Back from San Francisco_"), etheric guitar-based pieces with wonderful singing ("_No One Will Ever Love You_", "_The Death of Ferdinand de Saussure_") blip-bop electronica ("_Fido, Your Leash is Too Long_", "_If You Don't Cry_", "_I Can't Touch You Anymore_") and country-ish rock ("_Sweet-Lovin' Man_") to nearly pure voice stuff ("_Roses_", "_How Fucking Romantic_"), orchestral, pompous songs ("_Very Funny_", "_My Only Friend_") and experimental stuff ("_Punk Love_", "_I Shatter_", "_Love In The Shadows_") I think there's bad stuff in here ("_Love is like Jazz_", "_World Love_") to the absolutely brilliant ("_When My Boy Walks Down the Street_", "_The Luckiest Guy on the Lower East Side_", "_Nothing Matters When We're Dancing_", "_Epitaph For My Heart_", "_I'm Sorry I Love You_") and bizarre ("_It's A Crime_" being an electronic reggae track that brings [Culture Club](http://www.last.fm/music/Culture%2BClub "Culture Club") to mind). **The mind boggles**.

Not to mention "_Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits_" is a total steal off [Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestral%20Manoeuvres%20In%20The%20Dark)'s "_[Enola Gay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szIx2hOiVWs)_"!

Here's "_Come Back from San Francisco_", beautiful voice courtesy of [Shirley Simms](http://www.chickfactor.com/current/cf16_shirleysimms.shtml).

There is a lot of music hall in here, and I do wonder how much influence the songs have received through musicians like [John Woo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Woo_%28musician%29) (lead guitarist); on the other hand, [Merritt has played most](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_Love_Songs#Personnel) of the instruments himself.

Here's "_If You Don't Cry_" with vocals by Gonson.

It's a wild ride. The album is about to be [reissued in triple vinyl for appx. 100 US dollars](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F69-Love-Songs-Magnetic-Fields%2Fdp%2FB00274SIME&tag=niklasblog-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1).

Here's "_Papa Was a Rodeo_" with vocals by Stephin Merritt and Shirley Simms; this song nearly makes me cry with pathos and love. It's just so telling. Rather than using basic adjectives, Merritt has written about how his dad's a rodeo and his mom's a rock 'n' roll band. For fuck's sake, if only all bands were this eloquent and punk!

Here's a bit of the more trashy sound that Merritt developed for the band's latest album, "**[Distortion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion_%28The_Magnetic_Fields_album%29)**", but still from this album: "_I'm Sorry I Love You_" with vocals by Shirley Simms.

Finally, ending with "_Xylophone Track_", where Stephin Merritt lowers his voice so much it turns into a slow-mo Johnny Cash pastiche.

All tracks will be gone in a week's time. [Go buy this album now](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F69-Love-Songs-Box-Set%2Fdp%2FB000N4R9UM&tag=niklasblog-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1).

Finally, I must mention that L.G. Beghtol has written [this book on the album for 33 1/3](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMagnetic-Fields-69-Love-Songs%2Fdp%2F0826419259&tag=niklasblog-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1), and I'm getting hold of it promptly.

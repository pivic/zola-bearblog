Thanks to [David Berman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%20Berman%20%28musician%29), I discovered [this](http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=being-suicidal-what-it-feels-like-t-2010-10-20) article by Jesse Bering on the topic of suicide. It's on the brink of being aspergerishly written, e.g. that it goes through a lot of different variations on the topic of what leads to suicide, and also carries a few tips from Bering that I think sound a little weird - "live like a scientist" - but is otherwise very interesting. And, most importantly:

> In considering people's motivations for killing themselves, it is essential to recognize that most suicides are driven by a flash flood of strong emotions, not rational, philosophical thoughts in which the pros and cons are evaluated critically.

Said article focuses on a magazine article from 1990, titled "_Suicide as Escape from the Self_", written by psychologist Roy Baumeister who thinks that there are "six primary steps in the escape \[from the self, Niklas' note\] theory, culminating in a probable suicide when all criteria are met."

I think what Bering does best in his article is grind Baumeister's words down to an easily understood level. It's an article recommendable to all, which, I think, brings most further in understanding what may lead to suicide.

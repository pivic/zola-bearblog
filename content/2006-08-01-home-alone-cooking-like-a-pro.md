Yes, it seems to be a kind of subtle influenza, which is activated infrequently throughout today. I'm better now than yesterday, but still, I had to turn back home when heading for work this afternoon.

While home, I made some tomatoe-sauce poured it onto wholeweat pasta, yummy. It actually turned out fine, and I made that up just from memory. Still, it's a drag compared with the food I usually eat, i.e. the stuff I primarily don't make myself, but when I saw [this article](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2292596_1,00.html) courtesy of _Times Online_, I felt a lot better in the kitchen:

Jaysis. How to cook an egg? I'm impressed. At times like these I almost feel super-human, capable of anything. This will almost certainly sound very Nietzschean, but whenever I feel down and out in the future, I will try and remember this article and rise to the skies.

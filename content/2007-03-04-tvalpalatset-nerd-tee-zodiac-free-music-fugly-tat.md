[![Tvålis](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-03-04-tvalis.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/410536706)While at [Tvålpalatset](http://www.tvalpalatset.se) today with X, I discovered that they've opened the doors for the nether part of the place as the number of customers during the weekends are constantly going up. [Here](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/410536706)'s a picture of one of the two lovely parts downstairs. Oh, and Oskar, the proprietor of the café, has introduced some world-renowned chocolates (e.g. [Amedei #9](http://www.seventypercent.com/chocop/bar_detail.asp?ID=221)) and will most probably soon hook up with a company that will arrange tastings of chocolates.

I ordered [this t-shirt](http://dirtymicrobe.com/products/roflmao) a couple of days ago. I'm a nerd. Random quote from person who heard about it: "Haven't you heard about [the cultural revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution)?"

David Fincher's "[Zodiac](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443706)" has [finally premiered](http://suicidegirls.com/news/culture/20517) in the USA. Now, let me see it. Now, and not April 4th! Bloody late release-dates.

I love The Radio Dept. Haven't heard them? Download [this track](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Radio+Dept./_/The+Worst+Taste+In+Music+%28Extended%29) for free and realised why they're almost the most represented band on Sofia Coppola's [soundtrack to "Marie Antoinette"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_antoinette_(2006_film)_soundtrack).

Want more music? [David Sandström](http://www.david-sandstrom.com), formerly known as the drummer in [Refused](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refused), has a career of his own. Get his newest track at the above address, and his entire first album - now completely sold-out - [here](http://www.demonbox.com/david); for you non-Swedes, click the link at that page, then pick "Musik" and you'll get your free music.

A mate of a mate of a mate got himself [this tattoo](http://flickr.com/photos/andreasfrisk/404563574). I don't know about the band, but it's not very nice to look at, methinks.

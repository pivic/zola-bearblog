Come 2005-06-17, I'll be DJ'ing indie, alt-rock, and danceable music at Club Fidelity (Bonden, [Bondegatan 1c](http://www.gulasidorna.se/query?what=map&mop=mc&streetname=&streetnumber=&city=&zipcode=&mapstate=5%3B1629240%3B6579045%3B0%3B1626378%3B6581331%3B1632104%3B6576760%3B&mapcomp=4650605%3B%3BBonden+Mat%3BBondeg.%3B1+C%3B%3B11623%3BSTOCKHOLM%3B08%3B641+86+79%3B%3B%3B1629240%3B6579045%3B1%3B1&search_word=&where=&heading_exact=&heading=&heading_group=&company_name=&dir_area=&geo_area=&district_code=&ns=&stq=0&symbols=&ax=&pis=&map.x=239&map.y=207)), 20:00-01:00, together with two other dudes. We'll take turns DJ'ing every 30 minutes, which is something I really like, as opposed to people who don't stand on their toes! Come on! You're working for a crowd, right? I promise, there will be very little navel-worshipping when I get on and I'll give it my best.

There's no entrance fee, but you've got to be 20 years old to get in. Questions? Come one, come all.

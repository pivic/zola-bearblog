As Mikaela's dad heads off to the Swedish mountains to head a restaurant he owns, he invited the entire family to dinner at [Hosteria Tre Santi](http://hosteriatresanti.lunchinfo.com), a very good Italian restaurant in the south side of Stockholm city.

We all came, and the food was excellent. Mikaela had a fish course with _spinaci al burro_, and I had _petti di pollo alla S. Giacomo_, chicken filets with potatoes au gratin. I drank some red wine and got a bit tipsy and VERY tired. Anyway, the desserts were wonderful. Mikaela had a tiramisàº and I _Dessert dei 'Tre Santi'_ , ice-cream with liquor-marinated fruits, served in a oat-based basket.

The kicker was that the restaurant hid what people said was the best of desserts: their chocolate ice-cream. Its middle contained white chocolate. Really strange keeping that treasure from the general public!

We left the place in a haze, filled to the brim with delicious foods. I'm already looking forward to visiting [PerLei](http://www.perlei.se), a new Italian place that has received at least one very favourable review.

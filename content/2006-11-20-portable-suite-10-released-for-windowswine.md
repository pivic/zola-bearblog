[![Portable Suite 1.0](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-11-20-portablesuite.jpg)](http://portableapps.com/news/2006-11-20_-_portableapps_suite_1.0_firefox_portable_2.0_and_more)What, with Microsoft releasing new stuff, but [Portable Suite 1.0](http://portableapps.com/news/2006-11-20_-_portableapps_suite_1.0_firefox_portable_2.0_and_more) kicks arse. These apps are arranged to run from a portable device, such as a USB stick, and there's a [nifty menu](http://portableapps.com/files/images/homepage/portableapps_homepage_cr-13.gif) included. Theft of description is from the site:

**PortableApps Suite (Standard Edition)**: ClamWin Portable (antivirus), Firefox Portable (web browser), Gaim Portable (instant messaging), OpenOffice.org Portable (office suite), Sudoku Portable (puzzle game), Sunbird Portable (calendar/task manager) and Thunderbird Portable (email client) and runs comfortably from a 512MB drive.

**PortableApps Suite (Lite Edition)**: Uses AbiWord Portable (word processor) instead of OpenOffice.org Portable and runs comfortably from a 256MB drive.

**PortableApps Suite (Base Edition)**: If you'd like to pick and choose exactly which apps to include, you can try Portable Apps Suite (Base Edition). This is a stripped down package with just the PortableApps Menu, PortableApps Backup utility and custom folders, icons and autorun. It's less than 1MB installed, so it's a great option for smaller drives.

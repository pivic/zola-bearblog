I first heard [Autolux](http://www.autolux.net) thanks to [Trent Reznor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Reznor), who played them during his rant on a BBC radio-show a couple of years ago. He mentioned hearing this song and loving it, so he asked the band if they wanted to open for his band's shows, which they obliged with.

This track will likely make some listeners think the band in question are another droning [My Bloody Valentine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_bloody_valentine)\-copy, which they're not. This is a great track ((Despite [the lyrics](http://www.autolux.org/lyrics.html#hce), I know.)). This is throwaway and at the same time extremely easy to come back to at a later time, which turns it more than a tad interesting. The first time I heard it I thought it strangely had some potential; the intro made me think of MBV but also something along the lines of "what f-ing copycats! And this doesn't hold up for more than a few bars, I'll bet". Thankfully, I was yet again wrong.

Sadly, the album "[Future Perfect](http://www.amazon.com/Future-Perfect-Autolux/dp/B0002W4SFO)" doesn't hold up the entire run, but it does contain quite a bit of perspiration and inspirations. More tracks by Autolux are found on [their MySpace-page](http://www.myspace.com/autolux), so go check out the track "Turnstile Blues" as well, it's got a brutal intro.

As usual, the track will be removed after it's been available for a week.

Well, I'm actually starting to doubt the best operating system in the world.

Or, to be correct, it's not the operating system I'm having a feud with - it's the MacBook. [Apple still are extremely quiet and extremely tight-assed](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1018) about both admitting there is a wide-spread problem with the [MacBooks shutting down when they should not](http://news.com.com/2061-10793_3-6101059.html), and even though it's only (...) happened to me eight times in the past three days, I'm freaked out when it happens. Even though I'm a person who saves often and backs up everything (when I remember to), I hate it. And, of course, every professional maker of computers should make damn sure it doesn't happen.

And today, I booted my Mac. Or, wait, I didn't. The thing made the starting-the-Mac-sound, and the screen went a bit more luminated than if it were turned off, but nothing more happened. I think the hard-disk rattled, but I'm not sure. I held down the power-button, and it turned off. I pressed it, the turned-on-sound came, and same thing: a slightly greyish screen dawned, with nothing more. I tried this once more, before resetting the [PMU](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319) on the blasted thing. No effect. I switched words with [Peter](http://tesugen.com), who said his MacBook (which also likes to shut down and is currently in the shops for repairs) did the same thing, and you can solve it temporarily by pressing Cmd+Alt+T+R Cmd+Alt+P+R before you press the power-button. It worked! Temporarily, and, I may add, until the next spontaneous shutdown.

I really, really hope Apple fix this shit as soon as possible. Vista 2.0 or not, if this goes on after the repairs, if their very latest laptop shuts down as I'm working on important stuff, and this happens out of the blue, as often as the computer cares for it and killing my portal to the digital world in the process - I will get rid of Apple and Macintosh computers for fucking good.

By the way, check [this previous post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1001) for my happy (yet problem-heaving) ranting on the MacBook. I need a fucking time-travel-gizmo so I can sort shit like this out before I get to eat it. I just wish for a happy ending as the MacBook, when it works, is the best laptop I've ever had. And OSX is the best OS I've ever tried. Fuck.

[Antony & The Johnsons win the Mercury Music Prize](http://www.nme.com/news/113619.htm). Good one! If I'd have my choice, I think [MIA](http://www.miauk.com) should have gone home with the award, but I'm no one-man-jury.

But don't forget that [MJ's making a song for the victims of the recent hurricane](http://www.nme.com/news/113624.htm) (which, by sheer existance, served to make the gigantic social, racist differences between white and black in that country much more evident than it already was (if you can believe that)) in the USA, so don't act surprised if he calls you asking for a sotto voce.

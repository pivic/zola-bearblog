So, what went down on Saturday? Apart from further sketching on our yet-to-be-unveiled video project, we gathered more video loveliness to it as Björn and Kuba came by and said hello. We were to watch "[Withnail & I](http://www.criterion.com/ASP/release.asp?id=119)", but that merrily derailed and we instead drank, danced, sang SingStar and had a blast. I remember dancing to A Guy Called Gerald's "_[Voodoo Ray](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FmoY0A_lfk)_" in the middle of the night. All's well.

We imbibed Polish wodka with sliced cucumber, the later there to deafen the taste of the oily, turgid vodka. It worked! By the way, the vodka was made at a varnish factory. Beautiful. Paired with the sljivovica as displayed above, things worked just our way. One day and a few impaired human memory-banks later, we reaped the benefits by scouring through the ~200 pictures and the handful of videos we'd shot during the night, impressing and surprising me in their glory.

Oh, blissful Saturday! It's the best party evening in a long time. Many a thanks to Björn and Kuba for showing up, and to X for always being her wonderful self; the parties wouldn't be the same without you, honey!

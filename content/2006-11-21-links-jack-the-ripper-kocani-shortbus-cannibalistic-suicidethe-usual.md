[![Jack The Ripper?](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-11-21-jtr.jpg)](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6164544.stm)You should know that Jack The Ripper probably looked something like [this](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6164544.stm); Scotland Yard deeply probes onwards in the matter.

A while back I missed out on [Kocani Orkestar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK2IXVTeCrE), gah!

John Cameron Mitchell's new book, "[Shortbus](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367027)", is coming. [Read up](http://www.popmatters.com/pm/news/article/6688/sex-is-real-in-shortbus-and-inspiring-to-some).

How about [cooking your girlfriend and then killing yourself](http://www.crimelibrary.com/news/original/1006/2002_cooks_girlfriend.html)?

The BBC reports (somewhat MS-friendly) [this on MS Office 2007](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6165124.stm) and how prone people are do adapt to the new interface.

How about [this list](http://seanbaby.com/nes/egm.htm) of the ten worst electronic games ever?

[Read this](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730921.aspx) on how to handle really big Excel-sheets in v2007.

You're looking for free anti-virus software? Check out [AVG Free](http://free.grisoft.com/doc/5390/lng/us/tpl/v5#avg-free). Apparently it's "leaves" a very small memory footprint.

I like the idea of [microsummaries](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries/Using#How_do_I_start_using_a_microsummary.3F) in Firefox 2.0.

If you're into digital photography and Photoshop CS2, start using HDR. [Here](http://backingwinds.blogspot.com/2006/10/how-to-create-professional-hdr-images.html)'s how.

[MediaCoder](http://www.rarewares.org/mediacoder) is free software for Windows, allowing you to transcode (i.e. convert) a video or audio format to another. Works fine for me, so far.

Last, [how to hide files _inside_ JPEG-files](http://www.thetechtray.net/videos/rar/).

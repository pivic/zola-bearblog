Yesterday I bought "[_The Pale King_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King)", i.e. the unfinished book by [**David Foster Wallace**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace), an author whom I'm gradually discovering more and more to be absolutely astonishing. And today, [Bret Easton Ellis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Easton_Ellis) soiled himself publicly:

To the best of my abilities, I've found Ellis to be _extremely_ bitter of late. In [a quite recent interview with The Paris Review](http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6127/the-art-of-fiction-no-216-bret-easton-ellis), to me, he seemed to be a bitter, bitter recluse. Ironically, before Foster Wallace killed himself he seemed a lot more healthy ((Despite being depressed and having stopped taking his anti-depressants.)) in both the interviews I've read with him and judging from a lot of what his friend and colleague [Jonathan Franzen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Franzen) wrote about him and his death in his recent collection of essays, titelled "_[Farther Away: Essays](https://niklasblog.com/?p=10655)_", than Ellis has recently seemed.

_A bit of Wallace's writing from "__The Pale King_".

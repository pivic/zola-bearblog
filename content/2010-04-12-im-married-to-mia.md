It's true. I'm married. [X](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com) decided to wed me, to take my hand in marriage and love me forever. To some extent, I still can't believe it's all true. But it most definitely is.

We married in Norman, Oklahoma, in a park. We were married by a pastor from First Babtist Church, a man who used to be a cop but suffered a stroke and now "can't drive fast and shoot people anymore".

Malin and Bobby were our faithful witnesses and loving friends. Bobby handed me away to X. X was given to me by Malin. I looked at the pastor as he spoke and was told "don't look at me, I'm not the one you're marrying".

I nearly cried. I nearly didn't feel the cold through my thrift-store clothes as we stood there, suddenly cheered by students passing by in a yellow school-bus.

I wish you could all be there, but instead, you get to have us together instead, for quite a few decades to come.

And here's my heart to X, The Love of my life. May you always be with me, in sickness and in health, through troubled times and times like now, the best. I love you and forever will.

This Midsummer Eve went down last Friday and was wonderful. Normally, I've not celebrated it at all, for weird reasons. I must admit I haven't felt all accustomed to prancing around a pole and then drink myself senseless ((Yeah, I know...)) which is Swedish tradition. By the way, if you're reading this and not accustomed to the Swedish way to celebrate Midsummer's Eve, check [this informative page](http://www.sweden.se/midsummer) out.

This time around, [X](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com), [The Pirate Cats](http://piratkatter.com) and I went to Flen, where X's mom lives. We ate a lot of good food, drank a lot of good stuff - making up a couple of drinks in the process. X's mom made a lot of vegetarian food, and there were almost as many veggie people present as there were meat-eaters. I was presented with the good fortune to grill halloumi and mushrooms (respectively) which resulted in a few burned hairs and four happy vegetarians, ha! Happy me.

We left the dinner-table to play [kubb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubb), a traditional Swedish game which is played at Midsummer's. Here's a little film displaying a tad of the ordeal, and how I badmouth my poor opponents:

Having left the game as it went on forever - which games of kubb do quite often - some of us went around Flen expecting to find drunken teens, but no such luck! Instead, we carried on drinking and having fun.

Midsummer's was great. Great company really makes the scene.

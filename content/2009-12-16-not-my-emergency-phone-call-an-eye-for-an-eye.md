This is an overheard conversation, not from my work-place.

**user**: I'd like to burn a CD, but the software claims that I don't have a CD-burner installed. **support**: do you have a CD-burner plugged into the computer? **u**: well, that's included with the software, right? **s**: no, the ability to burn CDs depends on whether you have a hardware CD-burner plugged into your PC _and_ software for it. **u**: well, what's the point of delivering the software to us but no burners? **s**: well, what's the point of giving every user access to the internet when all they do is surf for porn?

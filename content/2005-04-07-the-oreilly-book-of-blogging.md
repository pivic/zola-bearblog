Sure, O'Reilly always publishes books which have all types of weird animals on the front, but "[Essential Blogging](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596003889)" really takes the prize. Check the cover out [here](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0596003889.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg). Poor kittens. It's the ugliest yet, either saying "don't f-ing blog!", or what about "one of the authors drew this!" or maybe "bloggers come in all sizes and shapes, and mostly resemble mutated demonic cats!". Hm.

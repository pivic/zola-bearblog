You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off you. You'd be like Heaven to touch. I wanna hold you so much. At long last love has arrived And I thank God I'm alive. You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off you.

Pardon the way that I stare. There's nothing else to compare. The sight of you leaves me weak. There are no words left to speak

\_\_\_\_\_

Say nighty-night and kiss me; Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me. While I'm alone, blue as can be, Dream a little dream of me.

Stars fading but I linger on, dear--- Still craving your kiss. I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear, Just saying this...

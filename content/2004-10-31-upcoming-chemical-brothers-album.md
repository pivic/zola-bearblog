I really wish I could attend their new-year party, but that's just really me being lazy. They, and a bunch of other [Heavenly Social](http://www.heavenly100.com/biogs/biog_sundaysocial1.html) celebs are holding Turnmills, London, hostage. Anyways, I'm sure Stockholm will suffice! Erhm. Anyway, on to news of their coming album, off the Chem's newsletter:

> On January 17th the Chemical Brothers return with 'Galvanize', a full blooded pulsing dancefloor anthem, featuring the vocal talents of US rapper Q-tip. From its pounding bass to its classic breakdown, it is the Chemical Brothers at their prime.
> 
> 'Galvinize' is the first single to be taken from the forthcoming new studio album 'Push the Button' due for release on January 24th, it's an immense and brooding album that looks set to once again revitalise dance music into 2005 and beyond, marking more than ten years of relevance in clubland.

Suddenly it dropped! And it's good. I love me some bombastic Nas stuff after his ride with Damian "Gong" Marley last year. Wee!

_Yee, word, that's some Remy Martin and some good-ass cigars, check it._

Speaking of which, check out the dance at the start of [this](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1885-three-reasons-fish-tank), a Criterion's _3-reasons-to-watch_ video thing about "_Fish Tank_", which I've yet to see. Eric B. & Rakim for President.

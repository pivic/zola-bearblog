Hey, [a new lunchbag](https://www.builtny.com/lunchbag.php)! I can't really see how it's constructed, and that strawberry must be drawn onto the cloth, right? Either way, it looks utterly non-obligatory.

I just ordered the [Jimi wallet](http://thejimi.com/wallet/index.php). I hate wallets, I liked the [demo](http://thejimi.com/wallet/demo.php) and my current quasi-wallet is falling to pieces, so why not?

It's not like I'm crazy doing it, like [Carlos Boozer renting his multi-million-US-dollar-mansion to Prince](http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,,1736496,00.html?gusrc=rss).

Even it's because of a current bug or whatever, I'm using [URLBunch](http://urlbunch.com) as a prime example of why one must test systems on and off before letting them into the real world.

Don't use it. Seriously. The idea is great - gathering a bunch of links into one single link - but the proof is in the pudding; you get served different links than the ones you submitted. See my goofy-sounding screencast about it [here](http://www.screencast.com/users/pivic/folders/Jing/media/f56b691a-68fa-4e11-9f9a-d7c465a9940d).

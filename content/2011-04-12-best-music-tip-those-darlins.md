As though a 1950's girl-group had morphed with parts of the Austin garage scene and bits of the [Ramones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramones), check out [Those Darlins](http://thosedarlins.com)' new album, "**Screws Get Loose**".

I love the production, which has successfully married hi-fi and lo-fi. And the lyrics. Cockiness always works on me when the voice backs it up, and it does. Song-titles like "_Fatty Needs A Fix_" just brings the sunshine in, don't they?

They remind me of [John Wesley Coleman](http://www.flickr.com/photos/theaccent/3619555643/). And [The Black Lips](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%20Lips).

Check out their first single off "**Screws Get Loose**" right here, this is "_Be Your Bro_":

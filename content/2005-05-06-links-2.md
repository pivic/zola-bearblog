First up, I found [a first comparison](http://www.globetechnology.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050425.gtcameraapr25/BNStory/TechReviews) between the Canon 350D and the Nikon D70s. Nice, and I'm still with Nikon, even though it's more expensive and has less megapixels. The lenses are said to be extremely good, I love the LCD display on top and the fact that you don't have to enter menues to see the ISO value (which is the case with the Canon).

Apple has now released [Bonjour for Windows](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/bonjourforwindows_readme.html) (XP/2000/2003). From that page, on what Bonjour is:

> Bonjour, also known as zero-configuration networking, enables automatic discovery of computers, devices, and services on IP networks. Bonjour uses industry standard IP protocols to allow devices to automatically discover each other without the need to enter IP addresses or configure DNS servers.

Remedy, the company mostly known for releasing the Max Payne games, have now revealed a little on their coming title, "Alan Wake". [Here](http://www.alanwake.com)'s the new web site, where you can see two screen-shots and download a trailer from the game.

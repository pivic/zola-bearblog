When visiting my parents yesterday, my mother piped up true to form:

> Oh, you've blocked me! You've blocked me from commenting on your blog! I knew it! Sooner or later you'd start blocking me, I knew it!

No, mom. I've started using [reCAPTCHA](http://recaptcha.net). So what's that?

A captcha is a way to make sure that the comments posted to my blog are from humans and not computers. Basically, it's to fend off spam. A user who wants to perform an action, e.g. comment a blog-post, has to do something a computer can't really do, like answering "What's 1 + 5?" or "Type notspam", in order for the action to be performed. _Captcha_ also sounds hip-hopish, which means I love it. Seriously though, whenever somebody uses reCAPTCHAs they directly help out with digitising books ((Which you may read more about [here](http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html))), which is the reason why I've enabled this on my blog. I'm giving back a little of what I'm getting. Instant karma!

[WordPress](http://wordpress.org), the platform I'm using to blog, is totally free of charge and always will be. I'm basically not making any money off this blog (([My host](http://bluehost.com) costs me appx. $50/year, which I hope to recoup based on what I make off [Google AdSense](http://google.com/adsense); of course, as I'm currently making appx. $1/1000 page impressions and the first payment will happen when I reach $100, my days spent swimming in liquid gold will probably wait a while.)) and I'm only using free add-ons and plug-ins for it, so why not give a little back to the community? What goes around, comes around.

![reCAPTCHA sample](http://recaptcha.net/images/captchaHomePage.gif)The image on the left side is a sample image of what a reCAPTCHA looks like. In order to have your comment posted you have to type the two words (with a space between them) and click the usual "Submit comment-button". Simple.

reCAPTCHA even helps you by [masking your e-mail address](http://mailhide.recaptcha.net), which is a very sane service to use when you post your e-mail address on the web or send it by e-mail. There is [a bunch of simple plug-ins](http://recaptcha.net/resources.html) that enable a few platforms, e.g. WordPress, phpBB and MediaWiki, to use this service. Speaking of tech and usability, reCAPTCHA doesn't mean people who are visually impaired are left out in the cold; there's a built-in option to hear the challenge read aloud.

Mom, do you get it now? ;)

I woke up today from Mikaela waking me up. We spoke of yesterday evening, and what had happened.

Having come home yesterday after all that shopping, Frederic came by, we all drank champagne and ate, then drank wine, listened to music, and went to Lino, a two-dancefloor place, where I turned into shambles much like [last time](https://niklasblog.com/?p=273). I cannot remember much from last night, other than that I felt extremely angry and jealous, for no logical reasons, spewing incoherent blather towards Mikaela. This is totally alcohol-induced, which (yet again) is an explanating factor, not a forgiving one. I should have stopped drinking at an early stage, and even though Mikaela and Frederic lovingly tried to talk me into not drinking more, their efforts failed. Mikaela and I left the place. I'm so sorry about it, and of course, she and I have talked it through, but the only way for me to try and control my drinking is to drink dramatically less. Hence, I will. That's all I can write about that.

Today we've watched a little of [Lost](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost), an American TV-series that we're finally getting into, after all our friends have been saying it's everything from "good" to "great". Mikaela's now sleeping, and I've seen my NBA Daily. Oh, don't forget to check [the NBA Daily humor](http://www.dfw.net/~patricia/nba-daily-humor). Among them:

> Scott Williams (Dal) on suffering a slight stomach strain, but not knowing how he did it: "I'm 36. I could have waved the towel too aggressively for all I know."
> 
> Ray Allen on Shawn Bradley: "He is like that battering ram in Lord of the Rings. They are holding the fort down and then the gargoyles come in with that big tree and start knocking the door down. That's kind of how it was. We're getting to the hole, then they stick him in the game and we're more passive. He just stands there but that's effective."
> 
> Brad Miller on Indiana's inconsistency: "It's not going to be peaches and gravy all the time."

So, off to post links.

First is [a link to a fake ad](http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/nyc/57941224.html) a guy posted, containing all types of weird demands. He got a lot of answers, apparently, due to the relatively low rent.

I like [Postsecret](http://postsecret.blogspot.com). The people who maintain the blog invite people to send them a postcard containing a secret. Upon receiving said card, they scan it and post it on the blog. That sounds like the Swedish site [bikt.se](http://www.bikt.se) \[which isn't functioning properly, at the time of writing this\], where people can type online confessions anonymously. Thousands of confessions of all sorts are lodged there, and unfortunately, it's all in Swedish.

I didn't know about it until today, but there's a site called [Starbucks Workers Union](http://www.starbucksunion.org), that's built and maintained by Starbucks employees - not the corporation. For you who don't know what [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com) is, think _gigantic corporation which doesn't care too much about ethics and is quickly spreading across the world_. The business is to sell a variety of coffees. To get a clue of how big this corporation is, let me tell you a story a friend of mine, Andreas, told me a little while ago. His ex-girlfriend's American friend came to Sweden to visit a few months ago. She quickly started bad-mouthing Stockholm for a lot of stuff, e.g. "why isn't there a decent restaurant open after 23:00" or something like that; of course, this could quickly be arranged, should the Swedish authorities let ultra-minimum wages and nil union laws drop. Anyway, this person ventured on to China, where she visited The Forbidden City. Well there, she was happy. In the City, there was a Starbucks. Whassup. Anyway, on Starbucks Workers Union, they try to help each-other; for instance, check out [this post](http://www.starbucksunion.org/node/71) where a 56-year-old worker reports how he was fired for (answering back and) fleeing from a customer who threatened him with death for not serving him well enough. People at the site take action, and hence the manager who fired the poor employee is receiving loads of mail and telephone calls asking him to change his action. This type of action I fully support. Fight the power!

New comic: [Pigtale](http://pigtalecomic.com/index.html). The images are amazing. I know nothing more about it though.

There's a [flickr pool for Mac stickers](http://flickr.com/groups/52239950786@N01/pool). I love the idea of people littering their Macintosh laptops, smooth surface and all, with [coloury](http://flickr.com/photos/hull/4972322/in/pool-52239950786@N01), [cluttery](http://flickr.com/photos/caterina/747277/in/pool-52239950786@N01) "[evil](http://flickr.com/photos/negatendo/734478/in/pool-52239950786@N01)" stickers.

Oh, Mikaela's sour-dough bread turned fabolous. I'll post pictures of it later.

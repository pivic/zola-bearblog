Hey! Check the smaller frame for the header titelled "Style". Now click one of the listed styles below and bang - you've suddenly transformed my blog into the visual style of your choice. Beware: should this not work instantly, it's because your web browser doesn't accept my cookie. You can tweak this in your browser's settings, and it's worth it.

Users of Mozilla Firefox report of no problems doing this, but you IE users out there, do as follows: click Tools: Internet Options: pick the Privacy-bar: click the Edit-button: type pivic.com in the text field: click the allow button and finish by clicking OK twice. Presto!

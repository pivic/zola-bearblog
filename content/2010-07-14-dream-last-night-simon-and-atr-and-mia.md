I dreamed that Simon, a mate, was sitting on the top of a high-tower roof, outside in the snow. It was dark. I saw a line of people a few meters away from him, as oblivious to him as he was to them. He was calling people for a magazine, MacWorld, asking if anybody wanted to go see Atari Teenage Riot for free as they were playing that night, according to him. He was being very enthusiastic.

I got really excited and quickly found X in the queue and told her the great news.

"Why excited?", she asked. "They're really not playing. The gig's been cancelled." "That's bad," I replied. "How come Simon's still calling people, then?" "I didn't have the heart to tell him", X sighed.

We then stood in line as the queue slowly went forward, and as far as I could see it vanished into a haze of snow. Simon had a glow about him and kept calling people.

Then, I woke up.

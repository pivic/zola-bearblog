A person at work comes in from the cold, says hi and launches into conversation:

â”€Niklas, are you conversing with your future employer? â”€Well, not right now, but I'm not starting ther-- â”€I mean, so that you know what you're going to be doing there. Do you know? â”€...I guess I knew that before I signed the contract. â”€Yeah, yeah, yes. So that you know.

Of course, this set off a hundred different thoughts, all of which were quenched as I thought any rational thought applied here would be the equivalent of setting fire to a million pounds. [Unless you are the K Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%20Foundation%20Burn%20a%20Million%20Quid). Stupidly, I tried:

â”€Generally speaking, I hope that every person knows what they're doing when they sign a contract stating that they'll perform duties for money. â”€Haha, yes, yes.

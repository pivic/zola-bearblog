Saw a brilliant little film called "**[God Bless America](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1912398)**", as written and directed by Bobcat Goldthwait, an old 80s comic who's become everything I hoped he'd become. See this film, I urge you!

Also saw [a documentary on Z Channel](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405496), which was great. Watching all of those great films just fly by...radiance.

Made Amurkan pancakes with banana and maple syrup. Mmm-good!

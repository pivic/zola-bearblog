[![Thorsten Flinck](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2012-02-09_130923.png "Thorsten Flinck")](https://niklasblog.com/?attachment_id=10029)

X's published [a brilliant series of pictures](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2012/02/09/tv4-nyhetsmorgon-efter-tio-thorsten) of [Helena Bergström](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5466) and Thorsten Flinck as they were "interviewed" by [Malou von Sivers](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malou_von_Sivers).

People in Sweden see Thorsten Flinck as a sort of insane renegade. It is my belief that _he probably is_ an insane renegade, but a lot more sane and a hell of a lot more interesting than most people are.

Malou von Sivers actually attacked Flinck, but he didn't do much about it. And he didn't respond to Sivers' non-questions, because...they weren't questions to begin with. And Bergström jumped into it all by responding kind of on Flinck's behalf, while he made the above face. **For almost an entire minute**. Now, that's art to me.

[Here](http://www.tv4play.se/nyheter_och_debatt/efter_tio?title=vad_tankte_du_thorsten_flinck&videoid=2153162)'s a bit of video for your enjoyment.

I understand him throughout this ordeal, let's just put it that way.

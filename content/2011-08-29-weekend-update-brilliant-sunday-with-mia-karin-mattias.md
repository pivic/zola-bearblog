Following the Popaganda music festival of 2011, which I left early on day two because of a troublesome stomach and the need to clean the apartment, X and I spent yesterday with Karin and Mattias, which was good fun! We ate dinner at TGI Friday which was nice - quesadillas for us, salmon for K&M - and we went home with a very nice cake that K&M bought, all lime and cheesecake from Gateaux. Yuuummy! We had a great time. It was really sweet to meet them again, as it's been such a long time. They've been working, we've been working, and we live a long train-ride apart. My stomach still hurts, but this time from laughing so much yesterday. X and Karin are the best of friends, seeing them together is just great.

...of course you need a Blixa-fix. Blurry Blix, the surprised and confused one.

I found this badge on the floor of a subway train I rode this morning! Must be a sign of sorts. Of what, I've got no idea.

As X ((A.k.a. DJ Grepen that evening - a name-change is planned according to herself.)) and I played rekkids all through the evening on Wednesday at Nada, our friends gathered and we had an absolute ball! As I'd brought my trusty Nikon camera I'm pleased to bring you a little slideshow of the whole thing in this post. As usual, more pics are available at [my flickr page](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic).

X played for the first time and you couldn't tell. I mean, she mixed and matched in a way that made me curious as to what would come next. I'm no pro, but I've DJ'ed so many times I know what pitfalls one can fall into when playing for the first time, and there were no technical hiccups (despite a faulty CD-player), no navel-gazing self-serving playing to be heard and she surveyed the room! I remember the first time I played, when I was so nervous I kept my head down at all times, glued to a playlist I'd made up beforehand. People rocked and lulled to X's beats, that ranged from Ladyhawke to Ace of Base to Okkervil River. Too bad there wasn't a dance-floor or I would have been antisocial and on it most of the time; instead I probably looked like a right muppet.

As for myself, I played tracks by Simian Mobile Disco, Dee-Lite, Depeche Mode, Marva Whitney and Soulwax, plus whatnot. It was very sweet, and very intense. I love the feeling where I know what track should be played next, I play it, and then get instant response from people - you see heads popping up from conversations along the room, Only once were we told to lower the volume! The staff at Nada was very nice which always helps. And having friends there turned the experience into something really special. I love you all.

I woke up with a very strange feeling buzzing in my head.

In my dream, [Björn](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3396057261) was standing in a forest, lit up by a strange, David Lynch-esque light and surrounded by indians all dressed up in garb like [this](http://www.old-picture.com/indians/pictures/Indian-in-War-Bonnet.jpg). Björn was holding a beer, wearing Fred Perry clothes, [danced like Ian Brown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8BXQEFZzEM) and suddenly I knew what he was doing. He was singing the chorus to The Dorian Three's "_Mr. Bartender_", but like this: "Mr. Beartender, Mr. Beartender, yo" - over and over again. And the indians dance-walked and did the "hey-ho".

In the middle of a forest. Dark. Warm. And repetitive.

It was a short dream, but will probably be long-lived in memory.

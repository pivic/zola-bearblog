Recently, at Tantogården, a big free area in Stockholm where people like to tan, play games, barbecue and drink, I lay ((Admittedly, with furry chest in the air.)) with X as two guys stepped up.

One wanted a high-five, so I obliged. Never can disallow a high-five, right?

**he**: Haha! You! \[pointing at my uncovered upper chest\] **me**: ...yeah. **he**: Hahaha! \[pointing some more\] **me**: ... **he**: You know, they say that us black are _monkeys_...but _you_...you're _chimpanzee_! Bwahahaha! \[pointing some more\] **me**: I know, I'm the king chimp! **he**: Hahahaha! But OK, you have a beautiful face \[makes a cup-gesture around his own face\] but... \[points at my chest\]... Ahahahaha! **his friend**: he's just jealous! **he**: right! Ahahahahaa!

And they walked away. I knew I had something in common with [Ian Brown](http://www.mewbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/ian-brown.jpg).

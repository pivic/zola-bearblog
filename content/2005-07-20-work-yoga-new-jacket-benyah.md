So you're asking yourselves how come I haven't written anything for a while. The answer is simple: I'm back at work and I'm dog-gone tired.

Even so, Mikaela has been teaching me the basics of [Ashtanga Yoga](http://www.ashtanga.com). Click that link and you'll get a description on what it's about. Apart from feeling more at ease after having excercised yoga, my back feels better than ever. Mikaela, who's better at teaching yoga than she thinks, also knows a lot about stretching. Today I learned that my [m. iliopsoas](http://www.exrx.net/Muscles/Iliopsoas.html) should probably be stretched more, as they actually affect the lower back; if your lower back aches, it might just be because of too short m. iliopsoas. I actually long to do another yoga excercise, and I'm so happy that Mikaela's such an excellent instructor.

I bought a new leather jacket for Autumn a week back, it's called "[Pontus](http://se.zoovillage.com/store/productdetail.asp?CategoryID=0&BrandID=173&DisplayItemID=13033)" and is by [Elvine](http://www.elvine.nu). There's even a picture of me in said jacket, so knock yourselves out [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-07-20-jacket.jpg).

A word on music: check out [Benyah's new site](http://www.benyah.com) - he's a Swedish rapper who's a member of the Skiiteri-collective that [I've written of before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=281). He's only got [one MP3 up](http://www.benyah.com/music/Benyah/Benyah_-_G%E5van_&_F%F6rbannelsen.mp3) but more will get there, so if you're into hip-hop, you know where to go.

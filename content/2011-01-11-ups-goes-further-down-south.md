So, I've called UPS three separate times to change the delivery address of a package. The third time they got it right, or so I thought. Then I checked their site to see where my package had gone.

_I'm-a goin' off to Kentuck-eeeeeeeee_

Hell in a handbasket! Things are more messed-up than if Sammi were to win a fist-fight against Snooki!

So, I called UPS. A representative answered very politely and said that the package was _not_ in Kentucky, but added that _they had to write that the package was in Kentucky to be able to make a note that they did not have the entry code for the door of my apartment complex_.

I see. The Mad Hatter's built a case management system!

P.s. Don't miss them tooting their own horn to the right in the above pic: "You asked for it. **We delivered.**". Actually, I have a few additional suggestions to that second sentence...

Whudda thunk it? I just listened to the Beastie Boys' "Skills To Pay The Bills" and it's horrifying to hear them rapping how it's 1992 and they still don't have a good president. Well, darn it, it's 2004 and still the same deal.

Bush has won Florida. Anybody convinced? He will probably win this one too. This is a day of sorrow, not only for the USA, but for the world. Did I sound like an American president off "Independence Day" there? Sorry! The only good thing about that film was the part where the aliens blew up the White House, and I couldn't sympathise with them more than on this very day.

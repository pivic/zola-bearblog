Is [the oldest woman in the world](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=816&ncid=816&e=1&u=/ap/20050304/ap_on_fe_st/brazil_oldest_woman) 125 years old? She surely looks extremely old, and extremely cool!

Dildo no more; [this article](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2005/03/04/notes030405.DTL&nl=fix) reports of a handful of US states where "genital stimulating devices" have recently been outlawed:

> And stores that sell such nightmare devices are declared a threat to the community and a hazard to the soul and a sure sign of the devil and if you are caught selling a vibrator or using a dildo you could get 10 years in prison and/or be condemned to live in Alabama for the rest of your life.

If you're into Noam Chomsky, and you should be, [check out this page](http://www.chomskytorrents.org), where you can get hold of a lot of his stuff. It's linked to from [his home page](http://www.noamchomsky.info), so don't go thinking this is illegal.

Don't forget to check [this](http://www.ssiworld.com/watch/watch-en.htm) out, a wonderful page displaying machines that scrap...machines. You can watch films of the scrappers (...) transforming computers, boats, DVD's and others to shreds. I'll bet somebody on the Internet's jerking off to that page. Somebodies like...power-tool-lovers.

Take the opportunity to buy and download music off [the Smithsonian Global Sound site](http://www.globalsound.si.edu). You can browse their available tracks by geographic region, culture and musical instrument, which is really cool. OK, Northern Europe, 2207. Let's get nationalistic for a second. Sweden. 81 tracks! Do I recognise any? None! This is the Smithsonian idea:

> Smithsonian Global Sound delivers the world's diverse cultural expressions via the Internet in an informative way for a reasonable price.

I _will_ buy music off that site. I'm looking at "Instrumental Music of the Kalahari San", for $13.35USD (which costs $20USD from a music site), check it out.

I've found [Métro](http://www.pocketpcfreewares.com/en/index.php?soft=2), a wonderful freeware Pocket PC piece of software. Here's what it does:

> Métro is a network calculator of (almost) all the subways and buses in the main cities around the world (around 200 at this date)! It is the only public transportation calculator taking into account the specificities of the metro in Paris and of almost all the undergrounds of the world. The networks are updated on a regular basis. There is a feature letting you "link" a contact to a subway station! You can update your networks online if you have an internet connection available on your Pocket PC (modem or cradle).

In their ever-lasting plan to compete with Microsoft to overtake this galaxy, Google has launched an [SMS service](http://www.google.com/sms), through which you can (if you're American, so far) ask questions and get answers through the miracle that is SMS. So far it's a beta service, but it'll probably grow into fruition soon enough. They now also support a weather service, currently for the USA only. [Here](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=weather+los+angeles%2C+ca)'s an example for Los Angeles.

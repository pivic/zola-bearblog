Yesterday Mikaela's family and I attended her second oldest brother's "studentskiva". It's the kind of party that people who exit upper secondary school throw, before enrolling in college, university or just start working for real. It was a lot more fun than I expected. I'm sad to say I didn't bring my camera, but there will be photos available, I hope.

It all happened at [The Viper Room](http://www.viperroom.se). It's a very shitty place that used to be called Monkey Bar; this name will give you a true sense of its origins, rather than the connotation with [Johnny Depp's bar](http://www.viperroom.com) in the USA.

Let me start by saying that the place we went to has received much critique of recent. Another interesting thing to know is that the webmaster actually deletes any negative words about the place that people write in their guest-book. I know, as I wrote something that appeared in it yesterday, that today is deleted. One fellow actually wrote that the webmaster had barred the IP-address that his school has, which means they can't even access the site from school. That's interesting. One might assume Johnny Depp's people would have trademarked the name "The Viper Room", which they're more likely to catch notice of if people are mad at the Stockholmian place that stole the name for their club. If you know Swedish, read some interesting comments about the place [here](http://www.aos.se/profile?fid=5&id=859065).

The party started. A few of the victims' parents were there, among them, Sebastian and Mikaela's, who, nice as always, drove us to the party and paid for our entrance fee. On site, we met Alexander, Mikaela's youngest brother, who told us that he'd get thrown out should be be seen drinking a single drop of alcohol at the place. Wow. That's not a very nice way to say it. Idiots. I mean, why be aggressive when one can be hyper-aggressive?

The people at the party were very nice. Oh yeah, on the way there, we saw a couple of lads in an entrance, gulping down 1,5 liters of pure moonshine. After a couple of beers at the party, Micke needed to go to the men's room, so I accompanied him. At first, he went for the loo, but just opened the door and closed it. As I didn't want to stand in queue, I went for it. I, too, opened the door but didn't use the facility. Why? One of the beforementioned guys sat there, slumped over, his drawers at his ankles, vomit dripping from his mouth, which was opened, while his eyes were closed. There was also massive amounts of vomit over the whole floor. Amateur!

We then started eating. The entrée consisted of a loaf of square, white bread that had been utterly drowned in oil, on which a shellfish mix with roe and a few greens rested. Crap. The main dish was chicken filets with rösti (not the real deal though, also drowned in oil) and some basic, heated ready-mix the staff called "sauce". It was all dreadful. The dessert was a chocolate cake, actually bought at a low-price place nearby. Everything about the dinner was dreadful, except for the lovely company. Mikaela sat opposite me, and to her one side was Anders, a very close friend to Sebastian, who is very charming. At my left side Micke sat, where he constantly tried to down as much beer as possible in as little time as possible. A waitress passed, saw that we had left a lot of food uneaten (even though I, from sheer hunger, ate all of my main course, which I utterly regret) and asked if anything was wrong. She could tell we didn't want to be rude, as we squirmed, trying to come up with something quasi-positive to say about the ordeal. Micke said everything was splendid and asked what dessert would be. "Chocolate cake", she replied. "Oh! I love chocolate cake! Mmmm! This will surely be wonderful, har har", Micke replied. The fact is, Micke loathes chocolate cake. I desperately tried to give him my chocolate cake, which Mikaela nibbled away, a piece of it anyway, after saying no to the waitress who asked if she wanted a portion of her own, hi hi!

We noticed the dinner was over, when Mikaela went to the bar to order water, only to return to find her chair missing. This was the way the staff showed it was time to leave the table and start partying. Nice.

We partied for a while, which was really nice. Every once in a while the staff came up to Alexander and asked if he had any adult nearby, vouching for his safety. Mikaela counted. I think that was good, as that behaviour showed responsibility. On the other hand, I snuck Alexander a few gulps of my beer and whisky once in a while. Har har. Fight the power!

We left at appx. 01:00, as Micke was getting shitfaced in a nice tact, Sebastian just a little round under his feet and Alexander...had left, together with the parents. We left to visit Rade, who lives just a little walking distance from The Viper Room. Yesterday, he bought a digital TV-box, which enables him to see a LOT more channels. Apparently, NBA lured him to it. He bought it just in the right time, to see [the 7th mind-blowing game between the Wolves and the Kings.](http://www.nba.com/games/20040519/SACMIN/recap.html) There are a lot of more extreme games coming in these play-offs, I'm sure. Damn, I'm getting into the basketball swing. Maybe it's a good thing I don't have a digital TV-box?

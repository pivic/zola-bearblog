As I've struggled with English words during the week, collecting them is a good idea to remember them. Here they are.

- **soliloquy**. an act of speaking one's thoughts aloud by oneself or regardless of any hearers, esp. by a character in a play
- **recourse**. a source of help in a difficult situation : _surgery may be the only recourse_
- **bon mot**. a witty remark
- **moggie**. cat
- **moult**. (of an animal) shed old feathers, hair, or skin, or an old shell, to make way for new growth
- **homograph**. A homograph is a word with the same spelling as another word but with a different meaning. ((From [this](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio/HA012300411033.aspx) Microsoft-page.))

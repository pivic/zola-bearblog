[![Tea](http://static.flickr.com/60/200995914_0c587b9ce9_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=200995914) Thanks to the advent of [33 1/3](http://www.33third.blogspot.com), I've caught up with "[Paul's Boutique](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0826417418/niklasblog-20)" by Dan LeRoy.

33 1/3 publish books on LP's, each written by a different author who is passionate, devoted and very in-depth: the books are liner notes on steroids, if you will.

This track is the second one from "Paul's Boutique", the follow-up to "[License To Ill](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000024JN/niklasblog-20)", the boys' exploration-of-frat-house-neanderthalia debut while on Def Jam. Once they'd moved to Capitol Records, their antics continued but the music differed.

Once Biz Markie got sued by Gilbert O'Sullivan, laws protecting the intellectual rights got more strict, but "Paul's Boutique" got made before that, and as [The Dust Brothers](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:rnd9kectkq79) and [Matt Dike](http://www.beastiemania.com/whois/dike_matt) added their mixes of old records, love for hip-hop and soul and spiced that with psychedelia, the result is explosive. In fact, there's even [this site](http://www.moire.com/beastieboys/samples) dedicated to keeping up with all the samples.

People didn't think so at the time, but the album has grown to become more than explosive in terms of infecting people with enthusiasm and a hysteric mind-set to make music of their own.

As usual, this track will be removed in a week. For more info on it, go [hither](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul's_Boutique).

Track is now removed as more than a week has passed.

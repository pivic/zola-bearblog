Courtesy of Lift to Experience's song "_To Guard and to Guide You_":

> Under the X in Texas is where you'll find me, it's where I'll be, Singing out the songs, warnin' the world of the perils to come. With a cloud by day and a cloud by night. Forced out of 'The Garden Of Earthly Delights'. And one by one the states will know as they crumble like Jericho, from Canada to Mexico that Texas is the rock to lift you up when the words collide. With the angels to guard and the angels to guide, upon this truth you can rely. So take two steps toward Texas tonight.

> Spoken: follow the Lone Star in the sky and beg for the angels to guard and to guide.

> Now the time has come when you must decide To take two steps toward Texas tonight.

Mentally speaking, I'm a few steps ahead.

[![Lauren vs kitteh](http://img.skitch.com/20080603-rcc5ktur32mekqpqs1h6mq6e6c.png)](http://skitch.com/pivic/cumk/lauren-vs-kitteh)_Cat with Lauren. Yes, the cat is wearing a sweater._

You've gotta love _The Hills_. It's an MTV reality soap that may or may not be completely staged, but never the less I like it a lot. It started out with focusing on the lives of two people, Lauren and Heidi, who moved to Beverly Hills where they got an apartment together. Since then, they've become enemies and people who are into the show are either on Team Lauren or Team Heidi. As far as I can tell, 99,9999% are on Team Lauren while Spencer - Heidi's boyfriend - is alone on the other side.

The girls are like many other girls in their early 20s who have a lot of money and security: they drawl, party, love clothes, travel, work, decorate, study, eat, hunt for guys, get heart-broken, talk a lot of shit and end up in fights. It's very entertaining.

Lauren's friends - Audrina, Whitney, and Lo - make up for extra entertainment. Audrina is nice, Lo is like an elf with no filter between what she's thinking and what comes out of her mouth and Whitney is nice and special; she is known to dent the English language quite a bit. From [this article about the season 3 finale at Gossip Word](http://gossipword.com/the-hills-recap/the-hills-season-3-finale.html):

> Whitney continues to add the “K“ sound at the end of every word that ends with a “G.“ For example when talking about Audrina she says: How's she doinK? She continues on by saying, “Maybe you guys are just driftinK?“ Oh Whitney. It's time to practice your letters again because you're killinK me!

While Lauren has become a kind of center of the series, showing integrity and getting constantly shat upon by so-called friends and lovers, Heidi is known for acting like she's never done anything wrong and being controlled by Spencer, her idiot boyfriend. It seems that very little reaches Heidi to let her return to being the relatively sane person she once vaguely appeared to be, which is quite evident in the clip below where Elody, one of Heidi's colleagues, tells Heidi to go to Hell in no uncertain terms:

That's because Elody once made the mistake to tell Heidi that she was going to apply for another job within the same company where they both worked; Heidi did the very same thing and got the position. And there you go.

_The Hills_ is an unabided, interesting view into the lives of a few people and I've not seen anything like it. Even though it may seem trite and you rarely see any regular-person-action on the show, it's nothing but an orchestrated insight into the world of a few people and has foul language and blatant sex peeled off; the main players are quite normal just-post-teen westerners who are looking to develop. Thankfully, with a lot of fun things in there.

[![Drawing from meeting](http://static.flickr.com/47/149286402_f52137a8c7_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=149286402)Thanks to UN, the USA are now in a little more trouble, even though they've got [John Bolton as their idiot-in-chief ambassador](https://niklasblog.com/?p=521); don't forget to click his image when you've followed that URL, and the link at the side to see the next picture.

So, what? Well, the [UN is against](http://www.guardian.co.uk/guantanamo/story/0,,1778948,00.html) the massive amounts of torture that the US government have exerted though the torture-haven that is Guantà¡namo Bay, plus the "secret prisons" around Europe, and, indeed, the rest of the world. You want more on that? [Here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/guantanamo/0,,1000982,00.html) you go.

For instance, three men from Manchester, England, were "forced to shave off their beards, harassed as they worshipped and once saw a guard throw a copy of the Koran into a toilet bucket" as is reported in [this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/guantanamo/story/0,,1773171,00.html) article. Or how about [the amount of detainees who try to commit suicide](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4998928.stm)? So let's see if the US government keeps holding their official torture-chamber in...Cuba...open. [They said no a little more than a week ago](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4760365.stm).

Oh, I can't wait to see "[The Road To Guà¡ntanamo](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/A9803720)".

Fucking bastard tormentors.

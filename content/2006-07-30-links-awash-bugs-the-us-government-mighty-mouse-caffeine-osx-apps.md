[![Rade, me, Tamara](http://static.flickr.com/60/201678413_846fd3e34e_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=201678413) [Scary ones](http://www.potatobugs.com/index.html), the potatoe-bugs. Really weird and horrid, but probably only misunderstood.

Much like the band The Grey, who are now [forbidden to enter the USA for five years](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/07/24/homeland_security_ba.html), just because they told border-patrol they weren't touring the USA (when, in fact, they were). [They lied](http://tinyurl.com/f7uzf), but should that mean they were to be treated like terrorists? I know, emo sucks, but anyway.

[No ghost](http://www.macuser.com/geekery/ghostmouse_in_the_shell.php) for you, if you're running the new [Mighty Mouse](http://apple.com/mightymouse) from Apple. I'm thinking about this combo:

The [Griffin iCurve](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/icurve) looks good, and needs a wireless mouse and [keyboard](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/1064002/wo/7K3mCY7P7rwa2erKMn81tVCH84C/2.0.19.1.0.8.25.7.11.2.3).

Nah. I might not need all that. The mouse is quite interesting, though.

[Calculate how much caffeine](http://www.energyfiend.com/death-by-caffeine), in a variety of ways, you have to ingest before you start [KeePassX](http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=push up daisies.

I like <a href=) for OSX; I've been using [the Windows-version](http://keepass.sourceforge.net) for ages, and it's really good, so why not for OSX, too? Lifehacker has [this post](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/downloads/keepass-password-manager-38223.php) on how to turn the Windows-edition into your life.

And I like [this menu-item](http://haroldchu.id.au/?page_id=3) that allows you to remember your library loans. OSX only.

How about [Creature Comforts going political](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N_tnsvmeAo)? Too bad it's not because of Aardman.

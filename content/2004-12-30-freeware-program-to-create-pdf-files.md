Wanna make PDF files without having to buy [Adobe Acrobat](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro/main.html)? Try free software, namely [PDFCreator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator). Sure, it has bugged out a few times when trying to tweak the settings, but it produces lovely PDF files and installs as a virtual printer, enabling the user to create PDF files from any program that features print functionality.

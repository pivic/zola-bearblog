This was an unexpected collection of short-stories. I have not read anything by [Alice Munro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%20Munro) before reading this, somewhat restrained yet wildly cathartic collection of odd stories.

Ten stories are collected here, all of them surrounding characters who seem to want to belong, who are in different stages of life. The tales are quite contemporary in tone, geographically centered around Canada and the USA, apart from the last story where Stockholm is involved.

One thing about these tales is that they all made me read faster and faster as I went along, to slow down at the beginning of a new one. Munro's styles spun me along. At times, I really wanted to get to the end, but these writings aren't about the end of the stories. They're based on the content. Or one simple thing. Or they provide an oversight.

They're a lot of things.

And I will most definitely recommend this domesticated yet feral tome to anybody who will listen. Impressive.

![Noisettes - Wild Young Hearts](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2009-05-06-noisettes.jpg)I really, really loved a couple of tracks off [Noisettes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisettes)' last album, "What's The Time Mr. Wolf?", e.g. "_[Scratch Your Name](http://www.imeem.com/people/xxjbQB/music/iCbNH2AU/the-noisettes-scratch-your-name/)_" and "_[Sister Rosetta (Capture The Spirit)](http://www.imeem.com/jukeboxmusic11/music/QwvdLief/noisettes-sister-rosetta-capture-the-spirit-album-version/)_". Forget all about that on this album.

No controlled screaming will now emanate from Shingai Shoniwa's mouth! There will be electronic beats making their first single, "_Don't Upset The Rhythm (Go Baby Go)_", that's currently #1 everywhere! You will find songs structured a bit like [Queen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%20%28band%29)'s "_Killer Queen_"! Aah!

If this makes your blood boil, read on.

The album curve-balls. It uses cleverly disguised monikers, spying ways and melodies to steer its way into your mind where it makes a nest, lays eggs and propagates faster than you can say Lady GaGa. This album will make you retch as you try to recall how many times you've hummed the songs over and over! You will have a hard time when somebody asks you which is the best song on the album!

And you will, most likely, love this if you're into great tunes. Elitism, fade away...

These are mostly great tracks; the guitar-playing, the harmonies, the song, the variety of styles and the sheer craft of song-writing is this forté of this group, with very little margin for error. They have created an album so strong, it doesn't contain a single filler. Nearly all killer, then?

Well. While Shingai's voice wrenches up and down and around, bends and twists, it doesn't rockingly, cooly break like it used to. On the other hand, it's made up through vocal skills and emotion, first and foremost.

So, [lyric-wise](http://lyricwiki.org/Noisettes:Wild_Young_Hearts_(2009))? While it's heart-breaking to hear her sad, mature lyrics off "_Sometimes_":

> Sometimes we start over And go solo We're looking for That summer home Beside the sea And for the future

...we've also got youthful and funny stuff from "_Wild Young Hearts_":

> Now that the city's awake, my heart aches Oh what a silly mistake it seems I've made You left your keys under my bed Left a thumpin in my head I would say sorry, what's the use

...there are actually bits of hope for the seeming lead character, and yes, I'm interpreting this a bit like a theme album even though it probably isn't; here's a tad from "_Never Forget You_":

> I'm sorry I'm a little late You know the stripes on a tiger are hard to change I know this World feels like an empty stage I wouldn't change a thing So glad you're back again

While the lyrics aren't exactly reading material, they're fair together with the sweet music; while a trifle like "_Saturday Night_" looks plain in writing, the song - reminiscent of [Ladyhawke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladyhawke%20%28musician%29) - bounces and makes for a perfect all-in-all song-to-play-before-you-head-into-the-taxi-and-go-out.

The complexity that's created between the song and lead guitar on some songs makes for brilliant multiple listens, e.g. "_Sometimes_" and "_24 Hours_", but I get the feeling that the band has worked on the songs rather than trying to further separate bits that make out the music, song by song. I even like the proper Amy Winehouse vocal rip-off in _"Never Forget You_"; the chorus kills me and shows how seemingly easy it is for this band to conjure up brilliant tunes.

Hooks are prominent, rhythms are changing between (and sometimes in) tracks and this album reeks of fresh, youthful yet matured and just radiant pop-and-rock: go get it now.

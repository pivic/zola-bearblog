Hernà¡n Cattà¡neo, the Brazilian DJ and producer, is [heading to Stockholm for a DJ date. 2005-07-03](http://www.hernancattaneo.com/tourdates.php?id=658&sp=2) is the day, a Sunday no less, but that's during my vacation, hitting in in two weeks! Loovely.

Also, you've gotta check out [Saul Williams](http://www.saulwilliams.com)' second album, "[Saul Williams](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:8c8n1v75zzxa)". He's a poet-cum-rapper whose lyrics and voce are great; combined with his poetry background it makes for very interesting listening. There's even a track done together with Zach De La Rocha off Rage Against The Machine on that album, so pick it up if you can, it's all I'm listening to right now, apart from an old [Chi-Lites](http://www.chi-lites.info) album called "[Happy Being Lonely](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:tmduak8k5m3l)". Oh, those Philly strings.

I've dreamt so much sick stuff for the past two weeks it's enough to fill a regular year of supply for me. I feel I have to start keeping notes.

Last night I dreamt that I was sitting in our living-room sofa, smartly dressed: buttoned-down blue, new shirt, hair plastered across my head (don't ask, it was surreal), knees together with hands on them. X entered the room from the right and I merely twisted my head in her direction to see what was going on. She was a [Whirling dervish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dervish#Whirling), hands flailing, body rotating, skirt afloat. She hit some paintings on our walls that came crashing down, while yelping to and fro.

Suddenly, I saw [Blixa](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3863507335/) entering the room, standing on her hind legs, dressed like [a Romani gypsy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Gipsy_Fortune_Teller_by_Taras_Shevchenko.jpg) while banging a tambourine to X's dancing. The both suddenly stood still before me in their respective constellations. The end.

Like De La Soul once asked: _what does it all mean?_

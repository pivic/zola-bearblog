Fo hizz, me has gots that bizz, I didn't think I'd wish, but after hearing his shizz, I went amiss, and just got myself tickets for [Morrissey's gig in Stockholm on the second of April](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-02-13-morrissey.gif "Moz, Moz, Moz!"). I wasn't planning to go, but now I've booked tickets for Mikaela and myself, and hence, ruptured my economy for this month.

The freaking ticket-system nearly gave up on me and [at the moment it's totally unreachable, but there you go.](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-02-13-morrissey2.gif "What you mean, logged out?").

The album is released the day _after_ the gig, argh.

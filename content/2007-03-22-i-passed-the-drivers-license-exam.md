Where [I once failed miserably](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1160), I now returned triumphant, passing with a combined score of 52/70! If I would have had one more error, I would have flunked, but no, I made it!

Ten minutes before the doors to the room where the exam was held were opened, I sat writing a letter while listening to [Voxtrot](http://www.voxtrot.net), thinking there's no way I would pass the exam as I've been very preoccupied with all kinds of stuff for the past month, to say the least.

When I sat down harmony descended and I felt confident. I felt like I had nothing to lose. The instructor told us they'd experienced a major power-surge this morning and hoped everything was alright. Fair enough; I'd just come to assess what gaps I'd have to fill in later.

But things turned out alright. F-ing ACES! YEEE-HAW! As I rose from my chair, the guy in front of me (we sat in rows) stood up and I saw "Failed" in red letters across his screen. Hence, I waited until I was safely away from him and the people waiting to take the exam before jumping up and down like a kid, which I instead did in [Cityterminalen](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/383105736).

Let me celebrate by quoting Jay Z:

> I ain't passed the bar/but I know a little bit

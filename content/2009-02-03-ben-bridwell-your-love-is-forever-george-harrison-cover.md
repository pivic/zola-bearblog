[![Ben Bridwell](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3023/2315750680_c04cfd9fc1.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/2315750680)When Band of Horses played Stockholm in March last year they played some beautiful, tender songs. When [they played Ryan Monroe's "_Older_"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n8DRfmmMFY), it felt calm, collected and nurtured to life. I even prefer the live version to the original.

Now, Ben Bridwell ((The front-guy of Band of Horses.)) has recorded a cover of George Harrison's "_Your Love Is Forever_" for a compilation titelled "Sweetheart: Our Favourite Artists Sing Their Favourite Long Songs", as published by [an evil coffee corporation](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/77141743).

It's a triumphant cover. Normally, I dislike covers that are even remotely similar to the original unless there's something very, very special there to make me like them. Bridwell's voice and his way with harmonies, the guitars, the sound of the track, the _rrrrrrrrrrrrr_ of the sitars in the background. Oh, my. It's the stamp of a truly gifted artist, who has combined technique with beauty.

> I feel it and my heart knows you're the one The guiding light in all your love shines on The only lover worth it all Your love is forever.

The track will be gone in a week.

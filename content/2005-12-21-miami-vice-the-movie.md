[Here](http://www.miamivice.com)'s evidence I'm not joking, and there's even a trailer out there, so keep your chin up.

Made by Michael Mann, starring Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx as Crockett and Tubbs, respectively \[...\], it seems the mullet US 80's are coming back just as [GTA](http://rockstargames.com/gta) was going away from most memories.

And oh, I do hope [MF Doom](http://www.mfdoomsite.com) has made his impession deep, because [RZA](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0753526) is making the original music. Too bad Limpizkit Park Doors Down (even though it's with Jay-Z) have made the crappy music in the trailer.

I just received a link to [this little piece of radio software](http://www.screamer-radio.com) not only enabling the user to listen to a huge variety of stations from all over the globe, but also to record them as MP3's, directly. The program is very easy to use, and easy to hide in your system tray. Click [here](http://www.screamer-radio.com/screenshots.php) for a few screen-shots.

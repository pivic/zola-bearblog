Even though exorcism may really be what is needed to get this song out of my head, posting about it might do just as well.

[Solid HarmoniE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid%20Harmonie) was a British pop group, even though I thought they were actually from [Denmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark "Denmark"); must be because I keep confusing them with [S.O.A.P.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.O.A.P.)...

Anyway, I was hit by an apparition: the members in this band have really big mouths. And _what_ an apparition this is!

OK, first Solid HarmoniE...

...then the brunette from A-Teens:

She not only takes the cake, but can easily devour it in one swift swoop! **Aaah!** Imagine inviting her over to a buffet, or getting the [Camorra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camorra) to dump nuclear waste in her mouth. I just find myself wanting to basketball-hook a turkey in there. Pow!

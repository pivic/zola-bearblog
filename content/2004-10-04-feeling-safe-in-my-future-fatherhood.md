I'm reading Michael Newton's "[Century of Slaughter](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0595004512)", which this far (I've read appx. 40 pages) seems to be a very insightful book on serial killers.

As I read of the [different types of childhood traumas many serial killers have undergone,](http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkiller_insight/trauma.htm) I feel quite confident I won't end up a very bad future parent. I mean, I'll try my best never to even raise my voice at my future kid(s), but reading of what some of these poor children, later turned murderers, went through is utterly heart-shattering. I couldn't even think up some of the vile deeds their parents committed, even if I really set my mind to it.

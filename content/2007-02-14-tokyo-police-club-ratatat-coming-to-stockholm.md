 _**Tokyo Police Club** - "Cheer It On"_

So, they're [coming to Debaser Slussen](http://debaser.nu/shopexd.asp?id=445#445) with [Ratatat](http://www.ratatatmusic.com)! Am I going? [Hell yes](http://www.last.fm/event/82097).

I'm more excited by TPC than Ratatat, but they're quite different which will no doubt put a finishing touch on the evening; too bad TPC's supporting and not lead. The singer in TPC sounds a lot like Julian Casablancas. Looking forward to it. _Operator! Get me the President of The World!_

ThinkFree has just released [Office Online 3](http://online.thinkfree.com/learnmore/index.jsp), which is a set of MS Office-clone apps (Write, Show and Calc - guess which apps they aim to emulate) that you can run online, i.e. without having to install them on your machine, and hence lets you run them on any platform that has a web browser, is online and runs java. Linux! Your PSP! Anything, nearly.

I've signed up for their free account that gives you 30MB's of storage for free, which is more than ample facility for my Office-files. Let's just see if I actually use this. The files are located on the host's server, which is sort of a security-ish drag but never the less, it's interesting and good, if you wanna show somebody an Office file and you don't happen to have Office installed on some computer that's online.

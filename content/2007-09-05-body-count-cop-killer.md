![2007-09-05-bodycount.jpg](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-09-05-bodycount.jpg)[Ice-T](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice-T) has rarely been a stranger for controversy, so when he formed the hardcore punk group [Body Count](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Count) and released their first album, "Body Count", nobody expected much noise than from the usual places.

_Unfortunately, shit ain't like that._

From Wikipedia:

> The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas launched a campaign to force Warner Bros. Records to withdraw the album. Within a week, they were joined by police organizations across the United States. \[...\] Over the next month, controversy against the band grew. Vice President Dan Quayle branded "Cop Killer" as being "obscene," and President George H.W. Bush publicly denounced any record company that would release such a product. At a Time-Warner shareholders' meeting, actor Charlton Heston stood and read lyrics from the song "KKK Bitch" to an astonished audience and demanded that the company take action.

I would give anything to see the decrepit and unintelligent Charlton Heston read those lyrics. By the way, hearing Bush/Quayle denounce people is like hearing Hitler say killing's bad.

"Cop Killer" song is about corrupt police, not _every_ badge-wearing freak, but as some people are bound by idiocy and the illusion of upholding the law, they ganged up and tried to bully the label and band into deleting the song from the album. Body Count's record-label, Warner/Sire, supported the band in the matter, but Ice-T swapped the track for another one, "Freedom of Speech", as he expressed why:

> I didn't need people to come in and really back me on the First Amendment. I needed people to come in and say 'Ice-T has grounds to make this record.' I have the right to make it because the cops are killing my people. So fuck the First Amendment, let's deal with the fact that I have the right to make it. \[...\] I didn't want my band to get pigeon-holed as that's the only reason that record sold. It just got outta hand and I was just tired of hearing it. I said, 'fuck it,' I mean they're saying we did it for money, and we didn't. I'd gave the record away, ya know, let's move on, let's get back to real issues, not a record but the cops that are out there killing people.

I really like this track. It's hardcore, it's punk, it's focused aggression funneled through a quite simple song. It deals with the fact that blacks are treated with less respect and authority than whites, by the American police. If you don't know what I'm talking about, read "[In Search of Respect: Selling Crack in El Barrio (Structural Analysis in the Social Sciences)](http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/print.asp?isbn=0521815622)" by Philippe Bourgois and you'll know.

By the way, don't dismiss the line "Fuck [Daryl Gates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Gates) ((Former Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department.))" so quickly; yet again, from Wikipedia:

> Gates gained great notoriety for his controversial and inflammatory rhetoric on many occasions. Some of the most notable examples of this were:
> 
> “¢ his remarks before a Congressional committee that "casual drug users should be taken out and shot," which he later explained as "hyperbole,"
> 
> “¢ his dismissive response to concerns about excessive force by police employing "choke holds." Gates attributed several deaths of people held in choke holds to the theory that "blacks might be more likely to die from chokeholds because their arteries do not open as fast as they do on 'normal people.'"

Fight the power and take it back! Tracks like these are **needed**.

You'll find the lyrics [here](http://www.lyrics007.com/Body%20Count%20Lyrics/Cop%20Killer%20Lyrics.html), and the song will be deleted in a week.

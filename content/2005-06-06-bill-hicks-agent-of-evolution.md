Buy "[Agent of Evolution](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007198299)" by Kevin Booth today. I've ordered it, but I haven't read it, so why do I recommend it? Well, Kevin Booth and Bill Hicks were friends since way back. Kevin's been tending to Bill's legacy in a very good way, and while Bill was alive it seems Kevin and he were involved in a variety of projects together, making films, music (as Marblehead Johnson - suck on that, [all you Bluetones fans](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:yzouak2kkmkp)) and audio recordings of Bill's shows. Buy it! [I liked](https://niklasblog.com/?p=204) "American Scream" by Cynthia True.

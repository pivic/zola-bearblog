![Marva Whitney](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-12-07-marva.jpg)As the story goes, [Marva Whitney](http://www.marvawhitney.com) used to sing in the James Brown Revue before cooking up her own stew. This album is over-looked by James Brown himself, who co-wrote some tracks and oversaw the general stuff. So, is it funky? Let me just say that if this doesn't move you, nothing will. And it's one of the most sampled albums in history.

Hearing Marva's voice, to me, was a bit like hearing [Aretha Franklin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aretha_Franklin)'s at the start of her "R.E.S.P.E.C.T.", you know, "_baby, baby, sweet baby_"; thunder struck.

And this track...as if the album isn't funky all-round! It's so good I can't stop, aaah! Check out Marva's yelping for appx 20 seconds right after the 2:00 mark, and that leading up to the pause appx. 2:27...and then the comedown. It's just so f-ing great.

This is greatness in a bottle.

As usual, the track will be deleted in a week.

Frederic and I took a late trip to town to go to [Slick](http://www.klubbslick.se), a club that's run by Asynja Gray and Daniel Bergqvist; the latter used to run a punkish club at Tip Top, one of the more legendary gay clubs in Stockholm for the past 10 years, where Frederic and I DJ'ed once. Oh, memories; the very same must have clouded our minds enough to make us give fawk all about time, so when we met Anka on the way and turned up at the place by 23:45, there were nearly a hundred people in queue to get in. Big ha-ha. We should have known better. Anka kept telling us we should have come into town earlier, but on the other hand, he'd come half an hour earlier, saw the queue and left; without taking a place in line. My comrades decided to venture further, to [Söderkällaren](http://www.sunkhak.se/hak/soderkallaren.shtml), an extremely shitty place in every way imaginable, I went home.

The south of town was filled with people, walking everywhere. I just read that an open-air mini-festival was held on Götgatan, _the_ street in the south of Stockholm, to celebrate the fact that it's been turned into a no-cars-allowed street. Queues to pubs and clubs were extremely wide and long. Jesper was out partying (in good fashion, as always) with Marie, but went home about the time I started looking for alternatives for us. Not that Frederic and Anka were bad companions, not at all, but I couldn't come up with anywhere to go, at that time. I wish Sweden could get more continental, soon. _I miss Madrid_.

I also wish I could have gone to the [Roskilde music-festival](http://www.roskilde-festival.dk) instead of hiking on the bad excursion tonight; [Sonic Youth](http://www.sonicyouth.com) apparently played a great set with [Merzbow](http://merzbow.net) as guest. Aah! Now, friends, it's bed-time. Adieu!

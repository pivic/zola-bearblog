Mikaela and I left home at noon to check out a house in Fruängen, which is up for sale at appx. 2.1 million Swedish crowns. It was quite nice even though it was a bit on a slope, which meant there were stone steps up to the house and it carried a steep back lawn. The house in itself was quite nice, having been built in 1936 it showed good wood-work in the floor, a sort of woven ceiling and not many errors about overall. I like looking at apartments and houses. Our next move, whenever that will be, will entail a bigger apartment or a house.

After that, we went to see another house but stopped as soon as we'd entered the front door, as the mere smell instilled distress in us. We left for home, and quickly thereafter went to see Frederic, which is duly documented in pictures [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-08-29).

We met up with him and left for an apartment that was being shown in the same house as his, so we found a few nice objects and also a very ugly drum that's shown among the pictures mentioned.

Frederic has recently bought his second Xbox, Microsoft's game console. We played "[Gotham Racing 2](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/pgr2/default.htm)", a very fast-paced driving game with loads of interesting traits. Among the stuff one can do, is to play online. As Frederic got himself a headset with his game, I was able to wear it and talk to other players while I played. I actually did a few jungle shout-outs ("Bring it down to the sound of the massive, up one to the Brixton crew, boo-ya ikki ikki ikki") and insulted a couple of Norwegian lads who didn't think I knew what they were saying, but all in good fun, no nastiness. One guy had masked his voice so he sounded like Stephen Hawking. I said "Oh god, is Stephen Hawking driving?" to which a quick-thinking englander said "Yes, and he's ahead of you". It was all a lot of fun, especially as the milieus were actual; the pictures had been photoed and digitised into the game. We had loads of fun with that.

Speaking of buying things, I actually bought a little bit of music stuff this week-end. I got myself an effect pedal for my guitar, together with a new sound card which would have enabled me to plug my guitar into my computer. Tops! I thought, but after I plugged in the new sound-card, switched on the computer and waited 20 seconds, it just went POOF! and everything went stone dead. My heart nearly stopped, and I had to control my breath not to go insane. The day before I lost one of my hard disks. No, not like last time when I lost all data on it (and the other big one). This time, it mechanically died. Yep, a Maxtor 5000XT, it carried 250GB and held out for 2 years. Anyway, back to the sound-card. I lifted it out of the computer, it smelled like smoke and then attempted to run the computer. It started without any bother. THANK BOG. I then plugged in another card, a graphics card, to try and see if it would work. Yep, it did, without any problems. Hm. I tried the sound card again and the computer didn't start. As something's obviously wrong with the card in question, I'm going to go back to the shop (Jam) tomorrow and see if I can get my money back. [Konsumentverket](http://www.konsumentratt.konsumentverket.se/mallar/sv/artikel.asp?lngCategoryId=712&lngArticleId=125) evidently gives me the right to, and I hope the shop people will, without hassle. I'm thinking of getting an Orange amplifier through the same shop, though, so I don't think they'll gripe much about it all.

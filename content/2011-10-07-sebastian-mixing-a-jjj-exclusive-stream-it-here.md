  [Sebastian on JJJ MIX UP EXCLUSIVES](http://soundcloud.com/edbangerrecords/sebastian-on-jjj-mix-up) by [edbangerrecords](http://soundcloud.com/edbangerrecords)

I'm not using Soundcloud enough, but I've now found the above mix by [SebastiAn](http://www.myspace.com/0sebastian0), my fave Ed Banger artist who - despite a surprisingly mediocre first debut album released a few months ago - here presents a shockingly good DJ-mix for the great Australian JJJ radio station.

It's an eclectic ride, turning Ed Banger artists on their heads as well as others. It's not as eclectic as his Spotify playlist titelled "[Sebastian presents...](http://open.spotify.com/user/edrecofficial/playlist/0FW1UJoiHTEdy62uhnrWVh)", but you will find artists like Skrillex, Beastie Boys, Cassius and Mr. Oizo in there.

Enjoy!

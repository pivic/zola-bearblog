A person named Richard Chi Fai Li claims that removing the top case of a MacBook that suffers from spontaneous shutdowns may lead to solving the problem; check [this post](http://www.macfixit.com/article.php?story=20060821101232169) to read further on the issue, and be very aware that doing so probably renders your warranty void.

Very interesting, and I hope it's true, in which case I believe it will force Apple to act.

While on the subject I've so far waited 8 work-days for my computer to be fixed. LAN Master say that they're waiting for the parts needed to fix my problems, even though I'm more than a little sceptical on whether swapping the logic-board on my MacBook for a new one will solve the issue.

Meanwhile, the recent firmware-update to fix the mooing fan in the MacBook seems to work for some and _not_ for others. [Take a look](http://www.appledefects.com/?p=84).

Apple! Get working!

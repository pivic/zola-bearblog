[![Pizza with parma ham and rocket](http://static.flickr.com/40/81713462_b0be876ce7_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=81713462) So, Frederic and I ventured into town today to look for different stuffs, and ended up at Julias splendid second-hand shop. I think we were there for 30 minutes, during which Fred found a marvellous shirt that would have made Timothy Leary envious. He also picked up a jacket which was great; it fit nicely, the pattern was splendid and the colours sublime. I only wish I could have afforded a leather coat I found, which almost made me look like [Herr Flick](http://www.parool.nl/dossiers/lijstjes/2002/beeld/1406-media_flick.jpg), but I didn't happen to have 4000SKR (~Â£300) on me at the time. Yada! Damn it.

Instead, I did something creative. I made pizza from scratch (with some assistance from Mikaela), even the tomatoe sauce, which is very simple to make, really - all you need is an hour for it to simmer by itself, and during that time you prepare the dough and let it ferment for an hour or so, and that's all there's to it - apart from rolling out the bread, which I didn't care for very much. I've gotta train at that. I'm very pleased with the result, and I really felt like eating pizza for a change, and as this is nice pizza with fresh ingredients, it's all good.

As you may notice, clicking the above picture of the pizza brings you a flickr photo that's been embedded in this site. This is thanks to the [WordPress Flickr Post Bar](http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/wp-flickr-post-bar) plugin I wrote of a few days ago, which has now been upgraded to WordPress 2.0. It integrates nicely with [FAlbum](http://www.randombyte.net/blog/projects/falbum), which allows my flickr pictures to be displayed on my site, and with Picture Frame, that I also mentioned. **Edit**: [Picture Frame](http://www.paulchiu.net/projects/picture-frame) does _not_ work nicely with FAlbum; as soon as Picture Frame's `frame="yes"` is in place, the picture won't link anywhere else than to the static flickr page, and not to your own FAlbum. Blah.

Speaking of flickr: if you're searching for a picture you can draw, [here](http://labs.systemone.at/retrievr)'s the perfect way to get what you need.

The day before yesterday, Mikaela said she'd like to contact a singing-teacher that some of her friends from her days at the opera had referred to as good. Then, in a moment of despair, Mikaela added that she was probably dead anyway. No, of course not! I replied.

Yesterday, as I was reading my news through a computer and Mikaela was reading [Dagens Nyheter](http://dn.se), she uttered something along the lines of "oh, cripes" and showed me a printed epitaph for said teacher. Goes to show how psychic you may go. I'll tell you when Mikaela's started to prognosticate the stock-market.

In the 80's it was turned into a temporary site for refugees, which it has stayed as until the place was shut down. Today, the place is totally delapidated and abandoned by all, some tramps exempt, which is why I went there to take some pictures. It turned out well, and I over-used different types of saturation while toying with the pictures, pre-processing them. Some even call the processing of digital images "developing", harr.

[![Crooked tree, crooked tree](http://static.flickr.com/57/219130457_40628b56b9_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=219130457) Today we're heading out to [Saltsj√∂baden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltsj%C3%B6baden), as we're purchasing [this Kenwood Major](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-08-20-kenwoodmajor.jpg "Ten years old, used five times. Sweeeet.")! We're thrilled. We're told the machine is ten years old, but has been used a total of five times. It looks very nice in the picture, anyway, and a bunch of accessories are included, as shown. The machine is severely ugly compared with a [KitchenAid stand mixer](http://www.kitchenaid.com/catalog/product.jsp?src=Stand+Mixers&cat=310&prod=349), but it's got a motor which is twice as strong, and is actually more expensive when bought as [new](http://www.electricshopping.com/shop/kenwood/shop.do?cID=128&pID=685). Mikaela is really looking forward to making her own bread, and I've got a mind into that as well. And we'll make our own minced meat, stuff sausages, et.c. Nice.

I have to say I rather liked [this bit](http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0609/feature2/index.html) courtesy of National Geographic, on shoes. Speaking of which...yesterday, Mikaela and I saw [a National Geographic-documentary about extraterrestrial existence](http://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/watch/program_details.aspx?id_program=8072), and even though it was quite Americanised it had a few interesting bits, once you cut out all the repetitions. I'll boil it down for you: it's all about numbers; if you count the 70 million million million (!) stars that probably are out there, the probability that we're alone, is...small. And we've only been trying to make contact for a few decades. The [SETI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETI)\-project has been alive for two decades. All in all, what's there to say we don't have aliens walking about us today? I can't help thinking about [Morbo](http://inner-moppet.net/morbo) and the [Omicronians](http://www.gotfuturama.com/Information/Encyc-40-Omicronians) (especially [Lrrr](http://www.geocities.com/zoidberg_fan/lrrr.html)). And I wonder how much the current US government is actually fighting to try and stay scientific (i.e. mostly by helping to dosh out cash to agencies such as [NASA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA), SETI and their likes) while trying to stay christian; if "intelligent" alien lifeforms are discovered, it will probably make the bible (and other major religions) look silly. Hm. [Tin-foil hat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin-foil_hat), on.

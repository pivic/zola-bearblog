X and I went to town.

We got a slew of fun stuff, by Jove. Throw your mouse-pointer over the pic to see the details.

I've been waiting to read Burroughs' "Junky" for ages. Haven't, ever. Weird. I've even read "The Yage Letters" apart from stuff like "The Naked Lunch" and "Nova Express".

Dorothy Parker...I've yet to discover her. I only know her as a wit, and as this volume includes "The Portable Dorothy Parker" as edited by herself, it's definitely a good step in, I'm guessing.

I like those reissued old Penguin books. The mere look of them makes me want to get them all.

Marilyn. With the book "Fragments" we actually got a couple of movie tickets to see the recent film where Michelle Williams plays Marilyn Monroe. Fun! This book includes Monroe's own poetry, pictures - there's an excellent shot on the back of this book of her reading James Joyce's "Ulysses" - and notes, translations and pictures. I'm really looking forward to it.

And X gave me a Moleskine Wine Journal. Excellent! It's so sweet of her. Finally, a decent chance to actually remember the contents other than "Oh! I remember this! It was good...can't remember anything else about it, though".

Chuck Palahniuk's novel seems enticing enough. Nice cover, ought to be enough, right?

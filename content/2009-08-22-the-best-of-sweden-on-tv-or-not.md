Yesterday X and I raided YouTube for clips from the Swedish-Norwegian version of the TV-series [Big Brother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big%20Brother%20%28Sweden%29).

There was a person named Jessica Lindgren in the house, and I don't understand how she was let into the series at all; just before entering the house, her brother had recently committed suicide. She seems to have been quite violent while in the house, both verbally and physically, hurling bottles and other stuffs. I've just seen a few clips, so I cannot say more about her. After Big Brother, she turned into a "jehovah's witness", which her family was already into.

The below clip carries a very tragic tinge even though it's comedy gold. I must say, I appreciate her blunt, vulgar and very straight-forward approach; for those of you who don't understand Swedish, it's still very worth watching because of falls. ((You'll see.)) Jessica informs a fellow contestant that they had sex by simply stating "your cock was inside my pussy" after he'd winced on the subject.

I really enjoy watching this to see how it really brings people to the surface. Just watching things as they progress makes me feel like an anthropologist and, at times, very horrified.

As we're due to soon be haunted by all types of supernatural stupidities, e.g. people extra-scared of walking under ladders, crossing the path of a black cat, et.c., 'tis the time of the season to repeat myself:

A couple of seasons of Saturday Night Live ago, Natalie Portman turned up and gangsta-rapped about her life. Funny as hell, I just came to think about this on the way to work today. Check out [the lyrics](http://kydem.blogspot.com/2006/03/natalie-portmans-snl-gangsta-rap.html) about her sniffing airplane glue and defecating in your face.

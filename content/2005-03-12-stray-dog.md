![](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-12-straydog.jpg)Last night I saw the [Criterion edition of Akira Kurosawa's "Stray Dog"](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=233). As this is the earliest [Kurosawa](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041) film of the ones I've seen, made a year before he started on his incredibly good samurai films, I thought he might not yet had got his shit together, but thankfully I was wrong.

This is another great collaboration between Kurosawa and [Toshirà´ Mifune](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001536), one of the most, of not the most, prominent actors I've seen out of Japan. Even though this is two years after Mifune got into acting, he shows his genius very early, playing Murakami, a young detective who desperately tries to find his Colt pistol that has been stolen. There is a wonderful darkness about the film; the characters, the directing (which is absolutely stunning), some of the characters and the rain, or the sheer absence of it. I will not say more of the innards of the film. In retrospect, if I'd read a single review or even the backside of the DVD box, it wouldn't have made any good. So, if I didn't know much of the film (actually not anything else other than what I've told you about the main character), why did I buy it? Simple: Kurosawa has not disappointed me yet.

If I could force you into buying [the Criterion edition of "Seven Samurai"](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=2), I bloody well would. Yes, it is that good. I actually gave a copy (=a Critierion edition, mind you very much) of it to the guy who tiled our kitchen as we didn't pay him much \[he didn't ask for much, as he's one of Mikaela's brothers' best friends\]. He's still not seen it, the bugger! Well, when he does, he can die happy.

Speaking of film, soon enough Criterion will be releasing what is considered by many to be _the_ documentary film, especially if you're into basketball. I'll get "[Hoop Dreams](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=289)" as soon as it's released. From the Criterion web site:

> Two ordinary inner-city kids dare to dream the impossible “” professional basketball glory “” in this epic chronicle of hope and faith. Filmed over a five-year period, Hoop Dreams follows young Arthur Agee and William Gates as they navigate the complex, competitive world of scholastic athletics while striving to overcome the intense pressures of family life and the realities of their Chicago streets. The Criterion Collection is proud to present this landmark documentary chronicling two remarkable families who challenge the American dream.

I've spoken about it with Andreas, who runs [Badlands](http://www.badlands.se), who says it's really good, so let's hope so.

Writing about films, another interesting item is "[The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=300)", the recent film by Wes Anderson. It's interesting to see that Criterion is following his releases with such vigour, as they normally release films made at least 30 years ago. "[The Royal Tenenbaums](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=157)" was Criterion-pushed not long after its cinema release, but I've got more hope for "Aquatic".

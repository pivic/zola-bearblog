In [this fresh video interview](http://news.com.com/1606-2_3-6147894.html) with Bill Gates at CES, he flaunts the importance of a "home server" that Microsoft will release to the general public, enabling users to access the same files no matter which computer they use to reach the data from. When asked, Gates adds that the server won't need a server administrator.

In [this video](http://news.com.com/1606-12994_3-6147955.html), from the same interview, Gates says Apple has a "huge disadvantage" in the digital living-room, in comparison with Microsoft. It will be interesting to see what goes down at [the Keynote event that Steve Jobs (Apple) will hold tomorrow](http://www.macworldexpo.com/live/20/media//news/CC539333) & [How to use Facetime on iPad | How to Run and Install Manually](https://facetimeforpc.site/how-to-use-facetime-on-ipad-how-to-run-and-install-manually/).

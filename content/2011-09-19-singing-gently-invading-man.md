Last week I went on a little walk around a lake near my work-place. Suddenly, the above man showed up behind a tree, singing. He was singing quite good, actually.

He quickly jumped onto the path I was walking on and made a stop-sign using one of his hands. No, he was not dressed like Diana Ross. Anyway, he sang to me for about five seconds, stopped, smiled and made a "you may walk" sign using both hands.

I walked on, knowing I'd just taken part of a performance bigger and better than most in Stockholm.

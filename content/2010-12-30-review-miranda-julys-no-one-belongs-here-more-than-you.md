[![No One Belongs Here More Than You](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZrBbRaIsL._SX106_.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2066751.No_One_Belongs_Here_More_Than_You)[No One Belongs Here More Than You](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2066751.No_One_Belongs_Here_More_Than_You) by [Miranda July](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/65678.Miranda_July)  
  
  
Miranda July's style is very evident, and shows throughout her film "_[Me And You And Everyone We Know](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415978)_" and very much here, in her short-story collection.  
  
I feel as though I could easily have become irritated by her characters, where the main person often attains the same view as she, seemingly over and over again. In some way. On the other hand, try and find a truly versatile writer, in that sense. And there are a lot more positives than negatives while reading this, put it that way.  
  
July does know how to write compellingly and in-depth, which I think is often hard when it comes to short-stories. These pieces vary in length, from two pages to something twentyish. The plots vary from story to story and often relate to basic human needs. Love, sex, money, work, friendship. Not in a corny, Oprah-would-love-this way, but rather in quirky ones, more emotive than intellectual. I can't really pigeon-hole this.  
  
Quite short, I'll say this is recommendable for all.

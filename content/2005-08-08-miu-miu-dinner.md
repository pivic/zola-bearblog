After work today, Mikaela and I ventured to [Nitty Gritty](http://www.nittygritty.se), where their sale was still on. I bought [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/32331103) grand Miu Miu shirt, we had a talk with the guy who is in charge of the in-house caf√©. He actually makes the pastries, bakes the cakes and makes the lunches himself, and it's inexpensive stuff - and I mean that money-wise. I haven't tried anything other than the espresso, which is good (and cheap).

We visited [Sattva](http://www.veganstockholm.se/lang_swe/shop.php%3Fmode%3DseeOne%26id%3D52&ei=l6L3QrCnPK7IwQGD1oCFDg) across the street from Nitty after that; it's a bakery offering biodynamically grown products, so we bought a loaf of bread that was filled with raisin, which gave the entire loaf great, natural sweetness.

We had that with [this dinner](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/32331102), made by Mikaela. Frr.

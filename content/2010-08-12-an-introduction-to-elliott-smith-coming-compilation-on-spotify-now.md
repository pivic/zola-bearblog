The first [Elliott Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott%20Smith) retrospective compilation-album, woo! I've compiled it on Spotify [here](http://open.spotify.com/user/pivic/playlist/6v4R4msVIwQkBpjIhBWHJw), so click that to hear what isn't out in the shops yet.

From [killrockstars](http://www.killrockstars.com):

> AN INTRODUCTION TO ELLIOTT SMITH On November 2nd Kill Rock Stars will release An Introduction to... Elliott Smith on CD and 180 gram vinyl. This album features fourteen tracks compiled from all seven of Elliott Smith's albums: Roman Candle, Elliott Smith, Either/Or, XO, Figure 8, From A Basement on the Hill, and New Moon.
> 
> An Introduction to... is, as the title suggests, intended as an introduction to one of the greatest songwriters of our era. We hope this will enable new generations to learn about Elliott's music by providing a pathway for people to delve more deeply into his immensely satisfying catalog.

**Morrissey**: "Animals are nicer than humans. And they're conscious beings." **Colbert**: "What about animals that eat other animals? **Morrissey**: "Only when they really have to." **Colbert**: "What about an animal that's already dead? Like a cow that's been sentenced to death for, eh, murder? Or a pig that commits suicide from listening to too many of your songs?" **Morrissey**: "You shouldn't laugh at that. \[chuckles\]"

Also, it's nice to hear his words on the English royal family. Plus this by Colbert:

**Morrissey**: "Do _you_ have a royal family?" **Colbert**: "Yes, they're called The Romneys."

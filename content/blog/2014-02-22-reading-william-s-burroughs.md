[William Burroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs)' birthday centennial was celebrated recently. I'm looking forward to reading [Barry Miles' biography](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17899672-call-me-burroughs) about the man, recently released, and the below video is a good splice of Miles' storytelling and video + imagery from Burroughs' life, narrated by [Miles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Miles).

I've always liked Burroughs. When I was little I was rummaging through my local library and found "_[Naked Lunch](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7437.Naked_Lunch)_" and was enthralled by a world that was very unlike my own; I loved the idea of the cut-up technique and adored that Burroughs had said that one would like "_Naked Lunch_" just as much read forwards as backwards. I remember that I didn't like the book as much as the idea of it, which is probably why I read it twice in a row, got out from there without the contents but with a new view of everything. Seriously, if I hadn't seen the film by Cronenberg I couldn't tell you much about the book today. Still, Burroughs was one of the main reasons to why I started writing my own stories. [Arthur Rimbaud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rimbaud) was the other one.

I really enjoy a bunch of Burroughs' other stuff, e.g. "[_Junky_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkie_(novel))" and "[_The Yage Letters_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yage_Letters)". I really have to read more. I think "[_The Language Virus_](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23938.Word_Virus)" will follow after the mentioned biography.

Burroughs loved kittens, free speech, had an open mind and tried to combat ignorance and boredom. What's there not to like about that? And don't miss to read [his final journal entry](https://niklasblog.com/?p=6623), which is a great way to finish off reading about Burroughs, I say.

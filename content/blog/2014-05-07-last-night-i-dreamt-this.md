X had bought a couple of new headphones that had terrific bass. She showcased this by playing a track by Young Leek ((And this must be due to the fact that we watched the very last episode of "The Wire" last night.)) and twerked and did a _Crazy Driver_ dance routine... Anyway, the bass from the headphones was so great that if anybody who used them listened to music with a lot of bass, and that person was, politically speaking, far to the right, his head would melt. And yes, it only happened to men.

In my dream, women weren't the wrong-doers. Men had to fess up to their crimes against women or their heads would melt in other ways. That news spread throughout the globe and men were scared. There was no easy solution, but men actually started speaking with each other about what they're doing to women, actually without blaming the women.

It was actually quite the calming dream.

It's interesting. [Spinsanity](http://www.spinsanity.org) shows how the Bush administration skews the political debates a month before the USA election is due. [Jim Gilliam also reports on how Fox tries hard to hide the fact that their news are as trustworthy as Nixon](http://www.jimgilliam.com/2004/10/foxnewscom_is_totally_out_of_control.php).

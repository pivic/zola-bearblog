[![Antifeminism](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2014-03-28_antifeminism-456x300.png)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2014-03-28_antifeminism.png)

I don't know why I waited for so long, but I finally got my head in check and unfriended somebody on Facebook who posted this; as he was confronted with how bad his posting this picture was, he said it was merely "a joke".

What a fallacy. It's not a joke. I may sound very harsh, but this is just so wrong. I can't be friends with somebody who treats men and women differently in this way, and adds to antifeminism. If you can't mend your way, go away.

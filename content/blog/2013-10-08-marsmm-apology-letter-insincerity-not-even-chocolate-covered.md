This is a copy of the "apology letter" that I received yesterday from Mars regarding [the M&M debacle that I've written about](https://niklasblog.com/?p=14092):

<script type="text/javascript" src="//e.issuu.com/embed.js" async="true"></script>

Now. There are a few things wrong here.

**1**. They hand me 150 SEK ((Which roughly is 22 USD by the exchange rate today, which won't cover even half of what a cheap dentist would take for a first exam of my teeth, considering the base of this entire ordeal.)) in candy vouchers which I don't actually consider as making up for the thing that I found inside of an M&M that I bought, but for having fought through their "customer support", which was slow over the Internet and really snooty over the telephone.

**2**. The contents of the letter is clearly translated from English to Swedish, comes out really _stock_ and the end of it, "och vi ber Dig prova igen" (("and we ask You to try again")), makes sense in English but not in Swedish, and the use of "Dig" instead of "Er" ((I.e. their using the non-formal Swedish "you" instead of the formal.)) comes out wrong and makes the letter sound even more insincere.

**3**. The person's title, probably one of the few words in Swedish in this letter, is written incorrectly; change it to "kundkontakt", damn it!

If there's one thing I can take away from this, is the fact that customer service from Mars really probably does originate from there. Wait a minute - what am I saying? Sorry, planet Mars. There's not enough oxygen on you to have [wolves living on you](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120304120414AA4wY0c), where they would be raising company Mars customer contact people.

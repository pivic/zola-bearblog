This company is redefining the meaning of 'shady'.

A few hours ago, they just posted [this](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/01/a-message-to-our-users/). From it:

> Thousands of enterprises around the world have done exhaustive security reviews of our user, network, and data center layers and confidently selected Zoom for complete deployment. 

Thousands of enterprises should have taught you not to miss out on your compound modifier, you…

Anyway, that sentence doesn't really account for the fact that Zoom have committed some atrociously heinous acts, such as (and not limited to):

- [Abuse how installation works on macOS](https://niklasblog.com/?p=24503)
- [Claiming to support end-to-end encryption while not doing that](https://niklasblog.com/?p=24499) and then, shadily inventing a nomenclature that steers away from standards
- [Sending your data to Facebook even if you don't have a Facebook account and hiding this practice from their privacy policy](https://niklasblog.com/?p=24469)
- [Installing a web server on your Mac that Apple had to build a tool to erase](https://protonmail.com/blog/zoom-privacy-issues/)

This is the best part of their message; are you ready? Here we go:

> Transparency has always been a core part of our culture.

If Zoom were to handle advice on how to handle COVID-19, some of it would undoubtedly look like this:

After sending that info out their CEO would naturally blog about how health conscious they've always been.

**Edit**: Zoom say they're gonna focus on fixing bugs and privacy-related issues. From [this TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/zoom-freezes-feature-development-to-fix-security-and-privacy-issues/):

> The company is far from done. Don’t forget that it [claimed](https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/) that calls are end-to-end encrypted even though they’re not at all. More importantly, the fact that Zoom is fixing issues as quickly as it can isn’t enough. Something is wrong at Zoom — there’s a corporate culture issue that leads to all those missteps. It’ll take much longer than 90 days.

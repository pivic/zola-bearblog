**Existential Comics** is a humour site where philosophy meets comedy.

Here's the latest example: [Philosopher's Challenge](https://existentialcomics.com/comic/336).

There's so much dark humour, making fun of philosophers and philosophy, and self-deprecation, that I love this page.

That, and the fact that the guy behind the site pointed out [Elon Musk's misappropriation of American tax-payer money](https://niklasblog.com/?p=21537), makes it a site worth to spend a lot of time on.

![Wu-Tang vs The Beatles](http://bandcamp.com/files/49/36/493699739-1.jpg)A few years back, [Danger Mouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_Mouse "Danger Mouse") mixed [Jay-Z](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z "Jay-Z") with The Beatles and made "**[The Grey Album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grey_Album "The Grey Album")**". Now, [Tom Caruana](http://www.myspace.com/tomcaruana) has released an album called "**Enter The Magical Mystery Chambers**" as Wu-Tang vs. The Beatles. It's a magnificent beats-laden mash-up! Find it right [here](http://wutangvsthebeatles.bandcamp.com) for now.

And damn, it's good! He's even thrown a bit of Tchaikovsky in there.

Here's a taster, sampling The Beatles' "_Yesterday_" and something from "**[The White Album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Beatles%20%28album%29)**" over words from [Wu-Tang Clan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu-Tang_Clan "Wu-Tang Clan")'s "_Criminology_":

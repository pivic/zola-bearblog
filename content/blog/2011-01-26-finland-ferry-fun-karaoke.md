So I'm going on a [Finland ferry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS%20Viking%20Cinderella) trip pretty soon and it's with my workplace, yeah, so don't even think twice that I'd do that on my own accord. **Never again!**

I'm actually afraid that my body will disintegrate like a vampire exposed to sunlight once I board that freaking thing. I feel like Karl Pilkington travelling the world in "[An Idiot Abroad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An%20Idiot%20Abroad)"; but where he's scared of everything unknown, I'm scared of the _known_. I've been on those things before, and the last time I was, I missed out Tokyo Police Club and Ratatat playing in Stockholm. Instead, I got drunken people everywhere, people chasing me through corridors and midgets falling down stairs.

If I'm going to have fun tonight, it's most likely I'll embarrass myself by singing karaoke. I love it and I really want to buy a [PS3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation%203) for it. No, I really don't care about the thing's BluRay capabilities, the games, the media server bit, blah blah, but I want to use a wireless mic and do SingStar Kent Queen all through the night.

To show you what I mean, here's a six year old video of yours truly doing [Beastie Boys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie%20Boys)' "_[Sure Shot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sure%20Shot)_" at a karaoke place in central Stockholm. See it and wish me all the best on the seas of cheese tonight...

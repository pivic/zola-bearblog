[This](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/31/bush_disassembles_en.html) Boing Boing post is interesting. I mean, there are many examples of Dubya's craziness out there, but this is an excellent example where his bad lingual skills either shows his madness flat out, or just blunts the perception of people further; when you listen to somebody who rarely makes sense, you tend to shut your senses down.

I think that if the people who voted for Dubya actually listened to what he was saying all the time, sifted through the _lingual_ craziness and saw the _sheer_ craziness, i.e. the gist of what he was actually saying, they'd never vote for him.

As Bill Hicks once said: "Remove the safety labels from everything, and the problem will take care of itself."

Loads of [people tweet about spring hitting Stockholm](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=stockholm+spring), and I admit to having done the same. For the first time, despite a lot of false starts, I think we're getting there. I really felt so standing in [Skanstull](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=59.3078528%2C18.0762265&hl=en&z=16&ie=UTF8), when the sun really shone down:

X met me and we went swimming for the first time in a bunch of weeks. It felt really good. Training, floating, working out in the water. Talking.

On the way home I saw how [Medborgarplatsen is transforming](http://s3.amazonaws.com/bk_store/images/photo_object/photos/3/4/3428474/200904013398.jpg). As spring hits, bar-owners throw out all of their furniture as Swedes - which I've written about before - are prone to drink outdoors whenever they can. True to form, the places open 17-ish were packed with people, even queuing to get in to drink beer in the sunlight! Nothing wrong with that, but it's so frikking cold in the air! And when the sun hides for the evening people scurry home or inwards like bats from...whatever bats are frightened of.

By no way, I think [Google pulled off the best geeky April 1st joke](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/autopilot/index.html).

I was actually hunting for some type of desktop-clutter-solving software for Windows, and at first found [this one](http://www.entbloess.com) through [Lifehack](http://www.lifehack.org), but as nobody has been able to download that software for more than a day, I gave up on it, and instead found [Deskloops](http://www.xilokit.com/deskloops/deskloops.html). This software is still beta, but downloadable and very nice! At first I had trouble getting the hang of it, but just remember two things as you run it: 1) push the mouse-pointer to the middle top of the screen and right-click, and you get an overview of all your open windows; 2) right-click while having the mouse on the left-hand side of the screen and you scroll that way, do it on the right-hand side...and you know what happens. I like it, but I may be giving way to [TopDesk](http://www.otakusoftware.com/topdesk), which costs cash and is actually just a steal off Konfabulator [Yahoo! Widget Engine](http://widgets.yahoo.com)'s Konpos√© and [Expose](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose) of Mac OSX, respectively. We'll see, but I fancy Deskloops the most, at the moment. Finding the right application is a matter of taking one's time, really taking time to use it and use it _correctly_, i.e. [RTFM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM).

Speaking of which, I made my latest gallery using [PostcardViewer](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/projects/postcardviewer) through [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com). How? Check [this guide](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/projects/postcardviewer/auto_desktop_instruct.html). All freeware.

Speaking of applications, a lot of people are looking for what might be the great use of AJAX, the programming technology a lot of people are screaming for. But what's the use? Well, if you're using [GMail](http://gmail.com), the e-mail-service that [Google](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/29/google_logo_redesign.html) provides, you know what I mean; [Google rely heavily on AJAX](http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php) these days. [Gregarius](http://gregarius.net) is another one. While there are [pro's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX#Pros) with this, there are most definitely [con's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX#Cons_.26_Criticism). A great use for this could be online storage. Check this post about it. I like the idea of opening a file through a provider, saving it in the application without having to upload it again, through some interface; currently only OmniDrive supports that, but check that post, it's quite interesting, even though I firmly dislike the thought of relying on having my files hosted somewhere; what happens if they go bankrupt? You've got three options: 1) you backup your files regularly, to a hard-drive at home. 2) You get a deal with the provider, saying they backup, care for, and give you access to your file even if they go bankrupt - and trust me, very few, if any hosts, will do this - so you can 3) not give a toss, which will only hurt you in the end. So what to do? Go with option #1, and rely on sane advice on what to go for.

It's interesting to see some of the products from the MySQL-team, such as [the migration toolkit](http://www.mysql.com/products/tools/migration-toolkit) through which you can convert Oracle-, MS SQL- and MS Access-databases to MySQL-databases. Very interesting, swift and sane. Works like a charm. Additionally, you have [the query browser](http://www.mysql.com/products/tools/query-browser), that's very user-friendly and a good way to learn to write SQL code. On the other hand, what's most interesting is [Eventum](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/other/eventum), which is a "a user-friendly and flexible issue tracking system that can be used by a support department to track incoming technical support requests, or by a software development team to quickly organize tasks and bugs". Very interesting indeed.

Need a few lessons in retouching pictures? See [these old pics](http://news.com.com/2300-1026_3-6033210-1.html), then imagine how they can be tweaked, using...the technology of today.

I just implemented [scrobbler](http://leflo.de/projekte/scrobbler), a WordPress plug-in that displays what you've latest listened to through [Audioscrobbler](http://www.last.fm), so that's now available in the sidebar, under "Latest listens".

I just bought [a new hard-disk](http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10468). For you Swedes, be sure to check it out, 250GB external USB 2.0 HDD is cheap at appx. 1300SKR.

And if you've managed to read this far, respect [Chewie's blog](http://huuuuuurrnnnnnnnnnnn.blogspot.com).

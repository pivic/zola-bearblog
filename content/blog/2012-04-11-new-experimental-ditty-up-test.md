I think it's all inspired due to "**[Living In The Material World](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1113829)**", a documentary on the most inspirational [George Harrison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison).

It's recorded in GarageBand using the built-in mic in the home computer. It's all recorded in one take, warts and all.

I enjoyed the theme that recurs throughout the entire thing, even though it should be tidied up, edited, properly recorded - aw, but then I'd never release it, would I? It'll be on Spotify soon enough, much to the chagrin of The Known Universe.

The BBC has filmed a [brinicle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinicle) forming in water under arctic ice. It kills anything alive simply by touch.

As I first saw the below video, I found myself both unable to look away and becoming horrified at the same time.

It's part of their massive new TV-series, "_[Frozen Planet](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mfl7n)_", which is a "massive polar expedition".

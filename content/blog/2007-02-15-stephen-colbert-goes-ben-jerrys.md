![colbit](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-02-15-americonecolbert.jpg)You guessed it. One of the biggest, truthiest Americans is getting his own ice-cream brand. I must be missing the cone-iness as it's in a freaking box, but what the hell, better that than having a truthcicle. Or a truth-dae. I'll stop.

The packaging contains "Vanilla Ice Cream with Fudge Covered Vanilla Cone Pieces and a Caramel Swirl", designed to lure elephants and asses to the goods, probably poison them, but the thing is: imagine these animals dying _together_. Only Americans or somebody more into American politics than those rampant in her/his own country ((That will be me.)) will know what the hell I mean by that.

I believe this would be better to ship to Iraq rather than the [363 tons of cash](http://americablog.blogspot.com/2007/02/bush-sent-363-tons-of-cold-hard-cash.html) ((Incidentally, appx. 12 billion US Dollars, of which 11 billion seem to have been lost.)) that the Americans dropped in Iraq.

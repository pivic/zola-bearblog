The above dome is from the innards of [Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet](http://www.nrm.se), a place of tranquility and glass boxes that have not been touched since the 1970s. Lucky us, these boxes contained stuffed animals.

The day was glorious!

And yes, I kept thinking "the owls are not what they seem".

I liked the lemming in the middle. Not sure why, actually.

The eagles weren't exactly what they seemed, either - or rather as they should be! Mangy eagles.

It's nice to see somebody's still using Windows 98.

Actually, I think the entire museum is a homage to the past millennium: nothing's changed since then, anyway.

**Seal me out!** Scary and yet enticing, much like a car crash.

Stop it, lynx. The bird is not responsible for your state.

In Polish, "seal" is "foka". So yeah, you fokas, just laying around. Foking around. ((I'm sorry.))

This T. Rex-replica is less scary than the foka above.

"Well, hello, it's a bit awkward knocking on your door in the middle of the night, but I was smoking some weed and got the munchies, and well, I started making pancakes and found out I had no flour, so could you please help a brother?"

The IMAX cinema. They asked if I'd "checked in", so I "checked in", i.e. I didn't.

They wanted visitors to put their visitor's stamp here based on where they were from. Malin picked America. X and I picked Outer Space.

At home we made some mar√§ngsviss. This is ice-cream, banana, caramel sauce and meringue. Mmm-good! Brilliant.

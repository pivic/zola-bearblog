One of my favourite front-people ever, [Gruff Rhys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruff_Rhys), has sung a track with [Mogwai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogwai_(band)), titelled "Dial: Revenge". Gruff - having written [the lyrics](http://www.mogwai.co.uk/words/Lyrics/Dial:Revenge) - is as funny as ever:

> “˜Dial' in Welsh means “˜revenge'“¦If a welsh speaker enters an English phone booth, having paid the coin/phone card the next command the l.e.d screen throws at the customer is “˜revenge!' thus setting the tone for a confrontational conversation

Here's the video:

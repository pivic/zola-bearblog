During lunch today, I quickly spent my 45 minutes of lunch doing the following:

- Bought and ate a big sandwich for lunch.
- Rushed to the subway.
- Filmed a beggar on the subway:
  

- Purchased stuff at åhléns, Skanstull.
- Purchased alcohol in Skanstull.
  

Not bad! Now it's time to go home and welcome The Pirate Cats who are coming for a little visit.

Now I've got my US and Aussie pals in check:

> [Microsoft Time Zone](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bff59fcf-3148-40b8-a286-fe7274f6e4d8&DisplayLang=en) conveniently runs in the system tray and allows you to easily view the date and time in various locations around the world. You can also quickly and easily add your own personal locations to customize Microsoft Time Zone the way you want.

On Monday, [Edward Hardwicke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hardwicke) died in London, 78 years of age.

"Who was he?" I hear you think. He played Doctor Watson to [Jeremy Brett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Brett)'s seminal, unequivocal portrait of Sherlock Holmes in the Granada Television-produced TV-series based on Holmes' adventures.

Here's an interview with Hardwicke and Brett from English TV, conducted in the late 1980s.

Today I helped D&T move from their old apartment to their new. There was a lot of heavy lifting but I have taken a long bath and read [Pauline Kael](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael)'s "I Lost It At The Movies" where she disses "[A Taste Of Honey](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055506)" (the film) so she can fuck herself.

By the way, that's Tobit in the pic above, gazing over the last goods that were to be chucked home. At this point, two seconds later, it started raining.

This car was parked right outside the new apartment.

Met a couple of deer as we were leaving the new apartment for the last time, having finished the move, which took a few hours but felt joyously triumphant at the end.

One of the deer scratched one of its ears using a hoof. Cat-like shit, right there.

Saw this fellow when leaving a local store in Bagarmossen. It looked sad.

I've just played a lot of The Jesus & Mary Chain, Morrissey and Primal Scream's entire "[Vanishing Point"](http://grooveshark.com/album/Vanishing+Point/370005). That album is one of the best I know. Here's a great song from it:

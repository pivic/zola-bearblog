It's interesting to see quotes like these from the current pope's mouth, courtesy of [this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5353208.stm) from the BBC:

> Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.
> 
> \[...\]
> 
> \[Violence was\] incompatible with the nature of God and the nature of the soul.

The pope stressed that the words were not his own, at the occation. Once pressed to dash out a public apology, he added that "the medieval text which he quoted did not express in any way his personal opinion" (I'm quoting said BBC-article).

Let's pair the Pope's statements with the following quote, shall we? From Matthew 10:34-36, the bible:

> Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.

Especially, don't miss out on the foot-notes in [my post on Mel Gibson vs all Jews](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1014), where you'll find some further naughty words from the bible.

_And peace to all._

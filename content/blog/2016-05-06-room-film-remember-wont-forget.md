> `**Mark**: How was work today? **Johnny**: Oh, pretty good. We got a new client and the bank will make a lot of money. **Mark**: What client? **Johnny**: I cannot tell you; it's confidential. **Mark**: Aw, come on. Why not? **Johnny**: No, I can't. Anyway, how is your sex life?`

The above are a few lines of dialogue from "[_The Room_](http://letterboxd.com/film/the-room)", a film that I saw yesterday with X and friends.

I'll give it 9/10 and at the same time 0/10. While I cannot do the film justice in any way, I recommend you see it. It may be the best _worst_ film I've ever seen.

I think, apart from the inexplicable details of the film that contorted my little mind, the best experience was watching X as she reacted to the film. I mean, she reacted _sanely_ - e.g. throwing hands in the air, making WHAT!? faces, laughing uncontrollably, flinching at the atrocious sex scenes - and she actually grounded me in reality, as I thought "glad I'm not the only one who thinks this film is completely demented".

Oh hell, that film was fun. If you haven't seen it, don't research it too much, just see it. It'll be worth your time.

Just one of the many-an-inexplicable scene from the film:

DN På Stan, a weekly insert that appears in [DN](http://dn.se) on Fridays, has reviewed Pappa Ray Ray today.

DN gives the café 4/10. Read the story [here](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=&a=416974&sb1594i0=1_416974) (in Swedish). A couple of days ago (i.e. before the article was published) I spoke with Johan, the guy who's referred to as "darned good-looking", who said DN had been around. He knew this as they'd sent a photographer that day, but he had no idea who the reviewer was or what they were going to write. "I just hope they didn't show up on Monday. Everything was chaotic. The bulgur had turned into mush. Just chaos."

It seems they turned up on Monday. I must say the casserole mentioned has never been as bad as DN writes of it to be, when I've eaten it, although it's been getting more and more oil included with every serving. Also, the staff have in total thrice missed my order when I've been there, forcing me to eat something else at a moment's notice. I sound like [the NY cousin in South Park](http://www.spscriptorium.com/Season5/ConnecticutKyle.jpg), right? You bastards! Anyway, I'm only eating the chicken casserole when there, as it's the tastiest of their dishes. I haven't tried a sandwich more than once, as it was very dry.

Oh, the reviewers from DN made fools of themselves by twice mentioning what a hunk Johan was, mentioning (hopefully ironically) that his good looks affected their overall grade. Here's the punch-line: Johan quit working there this week, and will only help out at times. Ha, you sexist reviewers.

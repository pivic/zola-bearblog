Today marks the one-year-anniversary since [X](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com) and I got engaged. I'm happy. _Happy_. I wish I could express this in words.

X's written about it [here](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2009/04/19/one-year-on-many-more-to-come) and while I feel a loss for words, I'll let imagery speak.

I love her, and our entire happy family:

_Baby!_

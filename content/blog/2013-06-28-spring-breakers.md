The quote above is from [Harmony Korine](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005101), the director, which he used to sell the idea of the film to James Franco.

I really love the film called "[**Spring Breakers**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2101441/combined)" by Harmony Korine.

This film combines a lot of feelings, a lot of mental sentiments and excellent cinematography, a great soundtrack used wonderfully, perhaps especially in the no-speaking parts of the film, the colours, the experience, the prejudice, the non-prejudice (from viewer and the characters, respectively), the dream-like sequences, the love, the hate. The non-sexualities. The breaking off from parents, authority figures, the love between peers. Support. Mad fun and stupid fun. This is truly a film to cherish and remember.

Cliff Martinez's soundtrack is really memorable; it fuses with songs by Skrillex and notably Britney Spears' "_Everytime_", which is played on piano by Alien, James Franco's character, to great success.

It's my favourite film by Korine. Buy it, watch it.

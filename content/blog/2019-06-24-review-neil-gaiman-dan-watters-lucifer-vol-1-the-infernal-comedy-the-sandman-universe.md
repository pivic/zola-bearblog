This anthology of stories started taking place years after the first "Sandman" series came to an end. After that, Leslie S. Klinger annotated them, which allowed a lot of Neil Gaiman's original ruminations to be explained and clarified.

History now moves on. Aided by raven Matthew, we are guided through worlds where the Prince of Sleep is, seemingly, missing, or even escaped.

Through a barrage of well-known entities, we see the Universe unfurl through large and very colourful representations of both Earth, The Dreaming, and other places.

Gaiman's style is the same as before, as is his imagination. The only thing that is remarkably lacking from this anthology is plot, which is lacklustre. I've always thought Gaiman to be an extraordinary storyteller, but where he goes on a downward trajectory he falls quickly; this is, sadly, the case here. The stories don't hold up to their usual standard and the epics feel repetitive in comparison with what previously has been.

This is still an OK collection of fantastical stories.

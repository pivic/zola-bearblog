?????

This is a humanistic work of art. This book makes way with the human experience, interactions between family members, and romantic interest much in the same way as Oliver Assayas did with _[Summer Hours](https://www.criterion.com/films/473-summer-hours)_ and Terence Malick did with _[The Thin Red Line](https://www.criterion.com/films/27513-the-thin-red-line)_.

This book is the best graphic novel that I've read since Adrian Tomine's _[The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/26/adrian-tomine-loneliness-long-distance-cartoonist)_. It reminds me a lot of the deeply human experience of reading Colum McCann's masterpiece, _[Apeirogon](https://niklasblog.com/?p=24485)_.

The book follows Nick, a young illustrator, who suddenly feels he can't be stuck in his same forms of interactions. Opening up to a plumber starts shaping consequences that are very strange to Nick, and he dithers into entirely new worlds.

I'll simply paste some of what I wrote to Will McPhail as I was reading this book:

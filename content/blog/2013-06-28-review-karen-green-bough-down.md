[![Bough Down](http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1362121040m/17194983.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17194983)[Bough Down](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17194983) by [Karen Green](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/176048)  
My rating: [5 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/633789337)  
  
This is a hardcore, honest and well-written book. It deals with Green's husband's suicide, some of what happened before that, during and afterwards. It's a painful and beautiful read, filled with trinkets of their life, their love and her anguish. Her delirium, her heart and her rationale is spilled out onto the pages, on which you can also read of her longing for him back. And of her picking her life up and putting herself back together, with The Support People. Added is her visual poetry as well, cut-ups from everywhere.

What is one of my top five favourite albums ever, **[Beastie Boys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie_Boys)**' "_[Paul's Boutique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul%27s_Boutique)_", has been reworked by DJ Food, DJ Cheeba and DJ Moneyshot for this mix, where the original tracks are prolonged, altered, mixed and voiceovers are added - this is SOME funky stuff, adding the "B-Boy Bouillabaisse" flavour all over

It's been quite some time since I listened to the album, and it's got so many sources and influences, I've gotta recommend [the 33 1/3 book about the album](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/301877.Paul_s_Boutique), written by Dan LeRoy; it's easily one of the best books about the creation of an album that I've encountered.

And recently, artist Danielle Mastrion has created a Beastie Boys mural to celebrate "Paul's Boutique"; check it out [here](http://www.spin.com/articles/beastie-boys-pauls-boutique-anniversary-mural-lower-east-side/).

Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, has now opened its first free wi-fi hotspot thanks to a bunch of sponsors. All you need (apart from a wi-fi-equipped computer) is a mobile phone: by sending an SMS to a certain number you will receive an access-code and you will then be able to surf for free when in [Kungstr채dg책rden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kungstr%C3%A4dg%C3%A5rden).

The project is open from 2006-08-07 until 2006-09-30, and there is no telling whether this will be a permanent solution.

More info about this is found [here](http://www.stockholmtown.com/templates/page____13469.aspx?epslanguage=EN).

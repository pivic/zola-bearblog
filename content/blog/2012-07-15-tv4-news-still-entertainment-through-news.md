Since [its dreadful, unintentionally funny becoming in April this year](https://niklasblog.com/?p=10539), the TV4 news-ticker at the bottom never ceases to confound. From today:

That roughly translates to "Bees search for living quarters in central Stockholm".

Well, I'd like to add a few species to that list, but wait - bees are all the rave in the TV4 news today!

"Lack of experience may be behind bee-swarms".

Hmmm... Let's see now. Could this mean that bees flock to Stockholm because they swarm? And do they swarm because of somebody's lack of experience? Hence - let's spread some knowledge to avoid scores of bees invading the capital of Sweden! I wouldn't want to wake up all honey-infested.

TV4 News: you know your beeswax. Why don't you mind it?

Despite their unveiling [a Windows Vista-loving keyboard](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/ultimatekeyboard/docs/Hardware_RELEASE_062206.html), there are dark skies approaching Redmond.

As [Microsoft are sacking 214 American sales-persons](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1983773,00.asp), they have recently disclosed the fact that [Office 2007 will be delayed](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1983845,00.asp) and now a [2.5 million USD antitrust-fine](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1984148,00.asp) will most likely be heading up. People are already thinking that [Windows Vista](http://lifehacker.com/software/windows-vista-beta/windows-vista-beta-a-tour-in-screenshots-183883.php) will be delayed further.

Oy vey. I wonder what their [employees think](http://www.savagechickens.com/blog/2006/06/employee-satisfaction-survey.html).

Of course, they _are_ the biggest company on the globe, but I'm very interested in what new products they will throw our way in the future, that is, if their head of research comes back from [his sabbatical term](http://news.com.com/2061-10805_3-6089195.html).

> I am recommending **_BoJack Horseman_**. _[BoJack Horseman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman)_ is a television show that makes me feel terrible but that I also love, and that I can’t stop watching. I wake up in the morning wanting to watch this deeply depressing show. I habitually watch this deeply depressing show in the bath, Epsom salts or no, during my relaxation time. I don’t know what to tell you. I guess it’s just really good. Maybe there’s some sort of reflective property going on but really I think it’s just genius writing—which always makes me feel just a little bit better about things.

I've seen all of BoJack Horseman. It's unstoppable; the latest season may be the best yet, and that's after oodles of human/animal behaviour at its peak. This is not a sad series. It's a _human_ series, possibly the greatest TV-series ever.

It makes me feel better about things, too. First and foremost, it makes me feel as though something on TV is actually connecting with what humans are thinking. Sure, it's larger than life, riddled with laffs, too, but at the core there's something that I just haven't found with other series, and it makes me cry, scream-laugh, and everything in-between.

It reminds me a little of Art Spiegelman's "[_Maus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maus)", one of my favourite graphic novels. The animal characters are just mirrors into ourselves.

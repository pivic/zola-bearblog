Thanks to the above I'll be grilling my hands off sooner than you know! Yeah, it's a really small grill and I don't want a big one; I've never been the typical it's-time-to-grill-now-y'all male, but soon enough I'll be splashing lighter-fluid onto charcoal ([sorry, Hank](http://dailybiz.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/king-of-hill3.jpg)) and pretend like I know what I'm doing.

Really though, I'm just looking forward to eating food outdoors with my beloved and friends. It's summer, and I intend to make it more so.

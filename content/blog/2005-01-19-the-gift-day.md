![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-01-19-me.gif)This morning Mikaela woke me up, proffering a gift! How sweet! She had given me the latest L'eau De Kenzo, the eau de toilette and deodorant. So I left for work, came home after a hard day's work and then Mikaela fixed a dinner for us, how very nice! We had bought a Faustino I wine, very light and fresh for a 1995. I was so tired as I've slept really badly the entire week, so I leaned to the right while eating dinner, heard some kind of frizzle and thought "My hair is on fire". Lo and behold, it was! I put it out with my hand, and sadly, there is no evidence of the big fire. I did, however, get the opportunity to have my picture taken while trying to look like a mix of the Swedish king and Bush II. [Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-01-19) be pictures!

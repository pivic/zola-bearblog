I got extremely tired of my old DVD-burner which I bought from Swedisc; the Sony burner was pure crap, hardly ever burned x4 as it wasn't compatible with any brand of DVD-discs other than the most expensive ones (which is hardly an exaggeration). Today, for a fourth of the price I paid for the Sony less than a year ago, I got a [NEC ND-2150A](http://www.nec.co.uk/DVD_RW__ND2510.aspx).

So far, I've burned four DVD's, all in time, no hassle and it's virtually sound-proof. The Sony sounded as if it were ready to die. At the end, I had to insert a CD/DVD appx. 10 times to get the operating system to read it at all.

Now I'm happy. This one's got dual layer support, which means one can record 8,6GB of data, yet that requires special DVD-discs, which still cost a bundle, yet that price will go down soon I hope. And then there are the blue laser-cut DVD's, which can hold appx. 12-23GB of memory, but that's _in the future_.

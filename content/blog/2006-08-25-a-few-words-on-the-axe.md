![Poppycocteau](http://static.flickr.com/76/223582245_8cc9c2869d_m.jpg)[Bernard Butler](http://www.bernardbutler.com), former guitar-hero of [Suede](http://www.suede.net), nowadays [Bert Jansch](http://www.bertjansch.com)\-and-[Phil Spector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Spector)\-worshipper and member of [The Tears](http://www.thetears.org/site/index.php), talks about the guitar in [this article](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1858079,00.html) published today in The Guardian.

I reckoned I'd have to read a maximum of three paragraphs before hitting Butler's love for [The Smiths](http://www.askmeaskmeaskme.com), and I was right; no surprise there, I would have done the same thing, and I hail Butler for standing by his love that got him into playing guitar (with gusto) in the first place. Also, on keeping yer guitars mum:

> A guitar is like a pair of boots. They've got to be a bit battered, and that takes a few years. \[...\] It's not cool right now to be technically extraordinary. The Libertines couldn't play guitar to save their lives. The attitude that you can pick up an instrument that's out of tune and thrash away at it, singing to your heart's content, is massively inspiring. We're fed up with supershiny pop records, and the monster stadium-rock bands. When I produced some of the Libertines' records, Carl Barat would come up with the simplest riffs and he'd not be able to play them properly, and it was brilliant. He didn't think in terms of complex scales and notes, just something to sing along to.

And that's love. Cheers to you, Bernard.

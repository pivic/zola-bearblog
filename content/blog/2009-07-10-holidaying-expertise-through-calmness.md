> She often speaks so softly She sends me to sleep She's the opposite of coffee She's the last thing I need first thing in the morning

I'm getting relaxed. Getting there. It's almost the end of the first week of my summer holiday and I'm entrenched in slowness. It's good. I'm re-learning how to take it easy. X and I are doing things like we try to cram in on the weekend, e.g. taking things slowly, waking up at our own (or rather, at the cats') pace, doing whatever we feel like.

This first week has so far been quite slow. I love it.

> You know I'm thinking of you In the bookstore, in the laundromat Guess how much I love you Much more, more than that

Last Wednesday we saw [The Lucksmiths](http://www.thelucksmiths.com.au) play Stockholm for the last time. They're doing a bunch of farewell gigs on their last tour before they break up, because "the last few years have been too much of an uphill struggle." Here's "_Sunlight In A Jar_", as recorded through my shitty mobile phone.

> And I say hey, it's a beautiful day And I'm starting to feel a lot better So wake up, wake up It's T-shirt weather

Currently, it's not t-shirt weather but we're holding up! It's a battle of the wills, nature! I long for summer and dipping my feet into the lake where my parents have their summer house. But mostly, I'm just prolonging the loveliness of behaving like a complete sloth. Reading a bit, reading news even less, watching TV-shows (("[Veronica Mars](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412253)" being my current obsession.)) and drinking coffee.

And celebrating X's birthday! My love's older, and wiser and...yeah, she's good at celebrating her birthday, and I won't say more. Congratulations, Love!

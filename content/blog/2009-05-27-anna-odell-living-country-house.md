Remember the part of the film "_[Cyclo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4MNu3NLHSk#t=5)_", where a prostitute is paid to drink mineral water of a certain brand over and over until she peed and a john watched? I couldn't drink that brand for a year after that.

That's how I feel about [Anna Odell](http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2515953,00.html).

She is a Swedish person who quite recently **faked** mental illness, acted psychotic near a bridge and got picked up and restrained against her will by the authorities, who wanted to help.

As Odell claims it was just an art project ((Which I think seems akin to being rude and, when confronted, you answer that you're simply _being honest_.)) designed to raise awareness about the state of psychiatric health-care in Sweden “” plus fill out her artistic portfolio, I guess “” I feel this is simply a cynical equivalent of war generals saying "you have to break eggs to make an omelet" when coldly discussing how many individuals on their own team they deem expendable when planning to invade an area. Where's the artistic merit in that?

I have nothing against art. Hell, I love dadaism, impressionism and absurdism! I think Marcel Duchamp's "[Fountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain%20%28Duchamp%29)" is a brilliant and extremely important piece of art. On the other hand, calling Odell's stunt a performance just bores me to the point where I want to buy socks. I think said stunt only portrays Odell as egoistic, especially considering the mentally unstable people in dire need of help who faced the option of having to wait because of her.

Imagine you're in the worst mental state you've ever been in, and you're lucky enough that you've managed to call for emergency mental aid before you do something drastic enough to hurt or even kill yourself, or somebody cares enough about you to help you get professional help.

Then imagine you're in that very state, but you can't get help because somebody entered the emergency psychiatric ward before you did, and that person's faking her/his ills.

I can't even begin to explain how much I loathe Odell's way. For quite some time, I've wrung my hands in despair by trying to cop something off her "art", but her stunt is intellectual teflon: nothing sticks to it. Nothing of value, at least. Maybe occasionally stuff that hits fans.

[X](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2009/05/25/debate-anna-odell-and-the-psychiatric-care) and [The Pirate Cat](http://www.piratkatter.com/?p=302) have already written respective posts on the matter, being more focused and intelligent than I am, to great value and extent, especially considering constructive ways of discussing Swedish health-care alternatives. There _are_ ways, e.g. discussion, debate and contacting your politicians.

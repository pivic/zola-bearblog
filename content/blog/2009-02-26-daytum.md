I've kind of fallen in love with [Daytum](http://daytum.com), a site made for ordinary people - or those with Aspergers syndrome - who want to keep stuff in check. I hope that I'm more of the first than the second, but in all probability...

So, what's this about? First of all, I love the design: clean-cut and simple. Second, as culled from the site:

> Daytum is a home for collecting and communicating your daily data. Begin tracking anything you can count and display the results immediately.

So, its _raison d'àªtre_ is as simple as that of Twitter. But what does it do, man? Easy. You display data through the use of panels or statements.

**Statements** is the simple bit: it's like holding a sign with what you've written. A digital post-it note. **Displays** are different. This is where you collect data, usually assembled by date/time or by numbers. For instance, you could show how many pages you read from different books by day:

As you see, that's displayed through a stacked line chart, but you can choose from a variety of charts. For example, you can use Daytum to easily visualise how you spend your days:

...and if you're a fan of, or you blatantly loathe meetings:

...or you might be counting the number of books you've read:

...and you can tell how long since you last drank booze and what you've drunk:

...and gander at what you've been eating for lunch:

Daytum is in private beta at the moment, but register your addy and hopefully get on the bandwagon soon enough if this tickles your fancy! New features are continuously added and can be monitored through [their blog](http://daytum.wordpress.com), and my Daytum is [here](http://daytum.com/pivic).

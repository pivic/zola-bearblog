Last night X and I saw "_[All Tomorrow's Parties](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870210)_", the documentary about the music festival that started out little and has since grown into a global thing, with ATPs turning up from the USA to Australia and London.

But it was to [Butlins Holiday Resort in Minehead](http://www.butlins.com/resorts/minehead) that I travelled in May of 2008 to experience the ATP that was curated by [Explosions In The Sky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosions%20in%20the%20Sky). I posted a little 1,5 hour-long video on the subject [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1480) and pics [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1473).

What I experienced can't really be pushed by words, unless Rimbaud came alive, went to the bugger and said it all. I really can't. Although I must say, this documentary made me shiver and tremble with love and a profound longing to go back as soon as possible. I'm not trying too be an asshole, but I think there's no way you can really get the gist of the festival unless you've gone yourself. And I think it's probably an entirely different experience depending on who's curating at the moment.

But back to the documentary. It's directed by [Jonathan Caouette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan%20Caouette) and the festival-goers, most of which contributed film and stills when ATP asked for it, mostly for this documentary. It's notably also shot by [Vincent Moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent%20Moon), who's done a lot of Take Away Shows, where he's filmed quasi-famous bands performing their songs (mostly acoustic sets) on the streets.

600 hours of footage that was compiled from fans was edited by [Nick Fenton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1067898/) and comprises this collage from 200 contributors. It's surprisingly coherent.

After-show delights from fans (including a girl trying to climb a cottage and failing) and artists (who are fans, of course), people arriving to the resort, history, gigs, snippets of [Patti Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_Smith "Patti Smith"), [Sun Ra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ra "Sun Ra"), [Iggy Pop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iggy_Pop "Iggy Pop") and others from different eras explaining how they feel about music are included, as well as the place in itself. It's a magical place that makes Tim Burton's "_[Alice in Wonderland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland")_" feel like a commercial trick. The people. The people! The after-shows, the gigs outside people's chalets, the cheap, bad wine from the shop in the center of it all, [Lightning Bolt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning%20Bolt%20%28band%29) blowing a speaker, the [Yeah Yeah Yeahs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeah%20Yeah%20Yeahs) walking around everywhere, [Daniel Johnston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel%20Johnston) sitting in a garden with loads of people hearing him sing and play an acoustic guitar, the sun shining in as the bloody seagulls squawk you awake and as you wake up you push the curtains - with the ugliest print you've ever seen - away from the window to see people returning home from a late late night that never really ends. Not until you leave. But the place sticks, and it's been a part of my heart ever since and it'll never leave, because it's just that beautiful. It's the wind moaning in your ears as you realise it's not the wind, it's the fact that you've just left a small chalet where Scott sits with a laser device, people from The National walk along and you hear bands in the background. Bands? What bands? You don't care, because it's all like one big party where nobody's headlining. _It's just music_, to paraphrase a guy - who looked a lot like [Jerry Garcia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia "Jerry Garcia") - in the documentary. From another time, another age.

I suddenly feel like [Hunter S. Thompson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson "Hunter S. Thompson") at the end of the film "_[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear%20and%20Loathing%20in%20Las%20Vegas%20%28film%29)_", where he talks and writes of the American election and how it _becomes_ America. The documentary is a part of the experience as much as a piece of the puzzle, and to me it's the bottle that says "drink me". Drink it! And then go to Minehead. You will be a better person for it. Trust me. There is no ego in this. There are no competitions. There's bingo in the early mornings, places to hang out with friends you don't know yet and the best feeling I've ever experienced with them, like you're all weirdly connected through more than music. I love it.

If there's something to complain about, I'd say it's the amount of publicity that Warren Ellis and Nick Cave gets. Otherwise, it's a great show.

Buy the documentary [here](http://ourtrueintent.com). I did.

Here's a couple of trailers:

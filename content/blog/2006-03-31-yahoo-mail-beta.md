I've just been given a beta-pass for Yahoo!'s revamped Yahoo! Mail.

[Here](http://overview.mail.yahoo.com/uk)'s an overview of it, and it's expected to be available to all users in the coming couple of months, if all goes well. I really like the drag-n-drop interface, the tabbed e-mail-conversations one can keep track of, and keyboard shortcuts one can use.

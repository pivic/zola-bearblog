[X](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com) and I celebrated our one-year anniversary with eating at [Le Rouge](http://www.lerouge.se). Sitting down at a table with X on the other side of a table is wonderful, but add hunger and great food to the mix, and it's even lovelier!

I can't even begin to describe the risotto. The fragrance of the truffle...I can't tell you how well-cooked this dish was. Creamy yet starchy from the rice, the individual flavours rising and being distinct by themselves. Fresh, crisp ingredients. A real little triumph. I ate this carefully, taking my time, and right opposite of me was X, and seeing how she really loved the food as well just made me tingle all over.

For dessert came the lemon tart with raspberry sorbet, and it absolutely **killed**. I savoured it as much as I did with the main, and didn't want it to end. The top might look like a shell, but was a very, very creamy, sculpted layer of white foam over a bed of lemony greatness. The bottom was harder, yet still not too much.

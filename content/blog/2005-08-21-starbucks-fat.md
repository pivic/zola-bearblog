As I was reading the comments on [this](http://manolo.se/index.php?p=419) Swedish post on coffee, I was reminded on a little piece of fact from the great book titelled "[Fat - The Anthropology Of An Obsession](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=niklasblog-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/1585423866)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)". Here's a quote for all you Starbucks fans:

> Two new products, the Strawberries & Crà¨me Frappuccino Blended Crà¨me and the Double Chocolate Chip Frappuccino Blended Crà¨me recently earned the "Food Porn of the Month Award" from the Center for the Science in the Public Interest's (CPSI) Nutrition Action Healthletter. Past winners of this award include the Coconut Crà¨me Frappuccino and the Vanilla Crà¨me Frappucino. This award is not for the best hard-core food ad but for food products the CPSI considers to be impressively unhealthy. A 20-ounce venti of either of these products has over 600 calories and while the Strawberries & Crà¨me has 7 grams of fat, the Double Chocolate Chip Frappuccino contains 16 grams of fat. (Venti means "really big" for those not fluent in American coffee café Italian). Neither drink actually contains coffee; the Nutrition Action Healthletter calls them "fattuccinos" - more like milk shakes than coffee.

Alright, I saw this poster while walking past a theatre with X and I just stopped in my tracks. It's a play based on one of my absolute kid's story faves, "[Historien om någon](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historien_om_n%C3%A5gon)". The entire story's there on Wikipedia.

It's really beautiful to walk to work in the morning.

I know the above picture looks very Blair Witch Project, but at least you get _something_, ha! What the picture says, is that X and I've been to [Mamas and Tapas](http://tapas.nu) on Renstiernas Gata 22 in Stockholm, which was a quite bad experience.

Service was mostly very absent and slow, food was mostly bland - apart from the mushrooms and artichokes, but I think that wasn't because of the deep-fry technique, more because the produce was good - and the dessert...don't get me started! That was supposed to be flambéed pineapple with vanilla ice-cream, but **hell no** if anybody states that they were flambéed!

I bit my tongue, didn't tell service and actually tipped them 30 Swedish crowns for the ordeal which was ludicrous as they didn't deserve a single penny. Arrrrgh. Hopefully I can dissuade people from going there by this post which will be read by a total five people, all wondering why I'm blogging about a Swedish place in English. ;-)

Oh yes, the "flambéed" dessert. Yes, now I'll shut up about this.

It's always a good thing to let a rant spill out into _Blixa's moments of Zen_.

Here's the story and link:

> Beans has been busy putting together a mix for your ears, which will in the most part resemble his Summercase dj set tune for tune. So whether you didn't make it along and want to know what you've missed or if you want to re-live that night...you can now download the summercase mix at [http://www.sendspace.com/file/2oq5tw](http://www.sendspace.com/file/2oq5tw)

**edit**: this has some sweet tunes on it. Kicking off with Max Romeo's "Chase The Devil", lounging into funk jazz, KRS-ONE, Jackson 5, afrobeat, Prince, Justice, Sister Sledge, Michael Viner's Incredible Bongo Band, _Bon Jovi_ and Daft Punk.

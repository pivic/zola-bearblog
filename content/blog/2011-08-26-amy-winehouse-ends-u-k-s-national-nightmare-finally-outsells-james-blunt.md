[The Amplifier says it better than I](http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/amplifier/89714/amy-winehouse-ends-uks-national-nightmare-finally-outsells-james-blunt) could. From the article:

> \[Amy Winehouse's "**Back To Black**"\] has officially been named Britain's best-selling album of the century. A few notes:
> 
> “¢ The century is really not that old yet.
> 
> “¢ Winehouse has saved Brits from a load of embarrassment: The previous top-selling album of the century was James Blunt's 2004 disc **Back to Bedlam**, which featured his ubiquitous, irritating smash "_You're Beautiful_."
> 
> “¢ Everyone in the U.K. should go buy a few more copies of Back to Black to ensure Back to Bedlam doesn't sneak back up on it because the margin is pretty slim -- 3,259,100 copies of Black compared to 3,241,118 of Bedlam.

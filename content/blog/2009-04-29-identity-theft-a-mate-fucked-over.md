The free Swedish mag called Red Pages, which is distributed to more than 400000 Swedes, contains a little something that their CEO, Peter Blom, calls an "advertorial". This "advertorial" is an advertisement disguised as an article for the magazine. Unfair enough.

The thing is, one of my friends are in this fucking mess with her husband and their daughter. The photographs used were shot for a wholly different thing. The photographer sold the pics to an agency, that in turn sold them to Red Pages who renamed my mate's family and made up an interview where my mate now "giggles", speaks about her husband's keen interest in soccer and how she herself can watch "Robinson" ((The precursor to the American show "Survivor".)). Fucking hell! What bastards!

Read more about the theft in Swedish right [here](http://www.resume.se/nyheter/2009/04/28/det-ar-en-djavla-blufftidn), as said CEO Peter Blom tries the blame game onto one of his colleagues and ends up saying nothing was made up even though it apparently is. Of course [I've tried to cancel my subscription to said rag-mag](http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/2913/redpages.gif) and I had to screencast my shaky voice regarding this whole debacle.

[![Pixies at Gröna Lund](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2014-06-10-11.25.14-1-410x300.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2014-06-10-11.25.14-1.jpg)

I went to see Pixies at Gröna Lund yesterday, and it was better than expected; well, I didn't really know what to expect other than from a few live video recordings but I hoped that it would amount to a lot more than oldie goldies from a very aged bunch on stage, and...it was. The songs are still so fucking great that they basically stand out even if the band would be decrepit. Hearing "_U-mass_" so early in the gig just upped everything, the weather was blinding sun and happiness and the company...I hugged X. And Ida was there, live and direct. So what were we watching? I mean, Frank Black's screams are still as they should be, Dave Lovering looks like Santa Claus in his grey beard and demeanour while drumming like hell, and even though Joey Santiago almost looked too comfortable on stage, it was a good show. I mean, if I'd have their back catalogue, I'd proudly tour it till the day I died.

I snapped some pics and shot a very quick video from the gig:

En route home I happened to see that Kim Deal, the former bassist of Pixies, and Joey Santiago both were born that very day ((A few years back.)). Naw. And I read [**this article**](http://thequietus.com/articles/15427-pixies-beyond-the-hits) from The Quietus, where Pixies' more unknown songs are celebrated. If you want to experience their better known tracks, I recommend the compilation named "[_**Death To The Pixies**_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_to_the_Pixies)" (Spotify link [here](http://open.spotify.com/album/718KJ6VFOdcqCFCWykJKoG)). Anyway, if you wanna experience the weirder tracks mentioned in that Quietus article, [here](http://open.spotify.com/user/thequietus/playlist/4U2GAdDKIknT95QGXrdLws)'s the Spotify playlist, and [here](http://www.deezer.com/playlist/893942321)'s the same playlist in Deezer.

Extra: Joey Santiago and Dave Lovering talk about how "Where Is My Mind?" was made in [this video](http://www.nme.com/nme-video/song-stories---pixies-where-is-my-mind/3607050385001).

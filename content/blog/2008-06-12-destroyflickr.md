![DestroyFlickr](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-06-11-destroyflickr.jpg)

I just discovered an [Adobe AIR](http://www.adobe.com/products/air) application titelled [DestroyFlickr](http://www.destroytoday.com/?p=Project&id=DestroyFlickr), which - despite its nasty name - lets you display, upload, download and comment pictures at [flickr](http://flickr.com), the most popular image and 90-second-video hosting website. It's completely free of charge, sweet.

I've made a short screencast that shows you how to basically use it, which you can see by clicking [here](http://screencast.com/t/HtF08DNz9).

You'll find the application [here](http://www.destroytoday.com/?p=Project&id=DestroyFlickr).

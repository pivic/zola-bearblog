It's my second Spotify single, all lo-fi. And by that I'm talking very acoustic guitar through Mac microphone.

It's as usual a frame of ideas and trials; I'm not making excuses by saying that. I'm satisfied while hearing stuff I'd love to have changed, but if I had access to a better studio, if I could play better, if I'd composed something before this...it wouldn't be me, would it?

**Bonus**: dogs yapping and howling in the background throughout the track. I reckon my upstairs neighbour will be demanding royalties _reeeal_ soon.

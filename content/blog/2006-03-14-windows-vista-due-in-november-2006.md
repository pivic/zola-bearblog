[Microsoft Watch says Windows Vista will be out in November](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1937540,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535). Yes, November 2006. I wonder how much RAM Windows Vista and Office 2007 will demand, running simultaneously while Internet Explorer 7 reloads a few tabs and Windows Media Player plays a video?

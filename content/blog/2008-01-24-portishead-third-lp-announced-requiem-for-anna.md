[Portishead](http://www.portishead.co.uk) have just announced the release-date for their third LP:

> We're pleased to announce that we'll be releasing our album, titled THIRD. on April 14th 2008.
> 
> The album has 11 tracks and is 49 minutes 13 seconds long.

I love you, you sly bastards. Finally, after 11 years since your last studio-album, a new one. And they're touring, but as of yet, not to Sweden. I recommend keeping updated through [their MySpace-page](http://www.myspace.com/portisheadalbum3).

Because they're announcing this terrific news, I'm letting you sample their cover of Serge Gainsbourg's "Un jour comme un autre - Anna", culled from the compilation-album "_Monsieur Gainsbourg: Revisited_". It'll be up for a week and then snatched away by evil gnomes. Enjoy.

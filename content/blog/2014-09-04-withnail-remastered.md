Arrow Video has decided to remaster "**[Withnail and I](http://letterboxd.com/film/withnail-i)**", which is probably in my top three film list, _ever_; you'll find a pretty site from Arrow Video about it all right [here](http://withnailfilm.com). Details about what the box contains follow after these two newly released, HD-enabled videos:

All is really impressive. I mean, a 200-page book, four documentaries, you get both Blu-ray and DVD, and you get _another_ film by Bruce Robinson, "[How to Get Ahead in Advertising](http://letterboxd.com/film/how-to-get-ahead-in-advertising)", which also stars [Richard E. Grant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Grant).

[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-22-musicthumb.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-22-music.jpg)I'm going to learn how to use Reason, if it's the last thing I do. And I'll try hard.

I got the drum machines working, that was quite easy, but I'll be damned if I ever get the sampler up and running! I mean, I recorded a few guitar snippets and then just imported one of the WAV-files into the sampler, but hey - no cigar. Nothing came out of it. Where's "play"? I'll have to work harder.

Today I listened more to Beck. I can't figure out why he's a scientologist. And Dustin Hoffman. Sure, John Travolta's a douche, but Hoffman? Well, reminds me of the off-camera story between Hoffman and Lawrence Olivier on the set of "[Marathon Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074860)":

> A story circulated for a long time that Dustin Hoffman (being a "method actor") stayed up all night to play a character who has stayed up all night. Arriving on the set, Laurence Olivier asked him why he looked they way he did. Hoffman told him, to which Olivier replied in jest: "Why not try acting? It's much easier." Dustin Hoffman repeatedly denied the story, and finally cleared up the story in 2004. The torture scene was filmed early in the morning, Hoffman was going through a divorce from his first wife and was depressed, and had spend the previous two nights partying hard. Hoffman told Olivier this and his comment related to his lifestyle and not his "method" style of acting.

A person at work said "that's not really using a guitar" about [my line-up](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-22-music.jpg). I mean, a [_Podxt_](http://www.line6.com/podxt) connected to an electric guitar and a computer? When I press arrow up or arrow down on the computer I not only change guitar, but mic and amp sound. It's called [evolution](http://www.merch-bot.com/images/products/500apesSTICKER.gif), cretin. Where were you when the drum machines took over the world?

Speaking of which, [iPodder 2.0](http://ipodder.sourceforge.net) has just been released. Go download your radio shows!

And by no way, [Goatse cookies](http://www.dontbewillful.com/misc/goatsecookies.jpg)!

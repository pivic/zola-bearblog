[![Threepenny Memoir: The Lives of a Libertine](http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1356443370m/9248062.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9248062-threepenny-memoir)[Threepenny Memoir: The Lives of a Libertine](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9248062-threepenny-memoir) by [Carl Barât](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4333664.Carl_Bar_t)  
My rating: [3 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/527908220)  
  

> I did an NME cover with Morrissey once, and Morrissey said, 'To some people I'll always be Morrissey from The Smiths, no matter what else I do. And you'll always be Carl from The Libertines.'

  
  
Yes, but these are not the words from a panicked man, even though Carl Barât seems to be frazzled and afraid at times. In a good way, because he lets his emotions go and reveals himself as another person than the confident man onstage, as he says he often comes across as, according to other people.  
  
He writes about his special relationship with Peter Doherty, about the greatness, of the "brown" and other drugs that helped to spoil it all (even though all of the responsibility of that use is of course due to Peter himself), and at the very end, on how they reformed. That actually makes this book seem rushed, as though a deadline was set. I'd love to have read more about the Libertines' reformation after the fact, but then we have Roger Sargent's visual documentary, "There Are No Innocent Bystanders", for that.  
  
Barât delves into what made him and Doherty gel, love and live. The former's heroes - notably Oliver Reed and David Niven - are referred to but mainly, this tome is a book on his own life.  
  

> Even though he'd ultimately kick my door in and try to steal my stuff, Peter gave me security and confidence to go out and do that, to believe that I could go out on a limb, even in prosaic, financial matters. When we were really firing on all cylinders and were together then it really felt like no one could touch us, and that nothing else mattered. As much as I try to deflect it, play it down and be English about it, there was a very powerful romance and beauty to our friendship.

  
  
Yes, and it spawned The Libertines' brilliant first album with a very good second one.  
  
All in all: reflecting on some Days of Yore while his girlfriend expects their first child, having disbanded Dirty Pretty Things and en route to releasing his debut album, Barât has written a scattered yet very honest book about his life, mostly his musical life, that is.

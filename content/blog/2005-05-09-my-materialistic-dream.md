I'm going to get myself a digital system camera, but I'm a little indecisive. It's either going to be a Nikon D70s or a Canon 350D, but it's leaning towards Nikon in a 90-10 fashion. And I also want a [Mac Mini](http://www.apple.com/macmini), which is another trip altogether. I've checked out [Tiger](http://www.apple.com/macosx/newfeatures), the new version of the OSX operating system from Apple, but as Frederic says, it may be better to wait half a year until Apple are to (or rather: will most probably) release a new version of the Mac Mini, hopefully with better hardware features.

[Steve Nash has just been chosen MVP 2004-2005](http://www.nba.com/news/nash_mvp_050508.html). Steve's the man (after [Reggie Miller](http://www.nba.com/playerfile/reggie_miller/index.html?nav=page) and [Ron Artest](http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/artest_page_0405.html), of course)!

Went out this week-end with Zak and Frederic, which was very nice. After spending a bit of time at Fred's place, talking, drinking and watching [a great South Park episode](http://sp24-7.lambtron.com/510grabs.htm), we went to Lino, where I've been [once before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=557). This time was a world of difference. There was a house floor, a schlager floor and a funk/soul floor, which was very nice! During the stay, I:

1\. Asked to hear any Rick James song other than "Superfreak", and got it instantly played by the nice DJ. 2. Said hello to one of [Leila K](http://tihlde.org/~ivara/leilak)'s old dancers (courtesy of Zak, who recognised him). 3. Tried to get a picture of a dwarf who was walking around everywhere, giving me [a nice Twin Peaks feel](http://www.duncancumming.co.uk/photos/theArm.jpg) (no offence, dwarves!). I failed. 4. Had a good time with Zak and Frederic.

Yesterday I had a severe hang-over, yet managed to go see Mikaela's parents in the evening. Thank gawd they live near-by, otherwise I wouldn't have the strength to go there nearly as often. Sebastian and I thrashed out a few songs in their basement. He plays the drums, and I tried to play the guitar. It was mighty fun! I haven't played with another person in years, not since I was in a band appx. ten years ago. Hm, I've got to brush up on my Nirvana, Guns 'n' Roses and Sex Pistols until next time.

I picked up Criterion's version of "[Hoop Dreams](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=289)" today. Steve Nash turned MVP, and now this. It's a sure-fire sign Indiana will win the finals this year. Fo sho!

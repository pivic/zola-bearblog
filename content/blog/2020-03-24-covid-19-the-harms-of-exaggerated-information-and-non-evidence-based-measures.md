I just found a scientific paper that is _[Coronavirus disease 2019: the harms of exaggerated information and non-evidence-based measures](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eci.13222)_ by John P.A. Ioannidis.

From it:

> If COVID-19 is not as grave as it is depicted, high evidence standards are equally relevant. Exaggeration and over-reaction may seriously damage the reputation of science, public health, media, and policy makers. It may foster disbelief that will jeopardize the prospects of an appropriately strong response if and when a more major pandemic strikes in the future.

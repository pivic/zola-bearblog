Went out walking yesterday after I came home; X'd made a sensational dinner: beet root steaks!

The sun. It's hard to think it was snowing only a month or so ago. Fuck that. Today, it's all about staying out when you're able to.

And yes, fuck _orientering_. The pole says "ORKA MERA ORIENTERA" which almost translates to "MORE STAMINA THROUGH ORIENTEERING" which is, as you plainly see, shit and [the terd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PXAcG8oETI).

Yes, the obligatory Blixa shot. She was so cute.

I sometimes want to add more Blixa posts, but as I hate people who photograph their children...well, if their children are cool, then it's ok. Blixa is always cute, so that's ok.

Watched "[Efterlyst](http://www.tv3.se/efterlyst)" some yesterday. That's the Swedish equivalent of American TV show "Cops" and "America's Most Wanted", which is atrocious. You'd think TV3, that broadcasts this pap, should have learned from the mistakes of others, but no. It's all talk about "monsters", "good" and "evil" everywhere, paired with chosen quotes streaming by from people have to say on Instagram and Facebook, which naturally, given that the host of the show doesn't like to listen to reason, is little, itty bitty pieces of shit. "Lock 'em up fer liaef!" isn't an unusual comment to be found. Medieval talk is always...medieval. And the cases... To contrast that, we checked out "[Uppdrag Granskning](http://www.svt.se/ug)" after that, an episode where the police attacked an 18-year-old man in holding for nothing; the case had after that been thrown out of police court. Talk about worlds apart.

Today I'm off from work - yeay! It's time to go to Stockholm University with X and friends, and dip my head into what [David Farrington](http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/people/academic_research/david_farrington) has to say.

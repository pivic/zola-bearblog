![Shot By Both Sides](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-09-09-shotbybothsides.jpg)I swear, I didn't know [Magazine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(band)) - the wonderful post-punk outfit that was founded by punk godfather/mystic/intellectual/super-songsmith [Howard Devoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Devoto) after he left [Buzzcocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzcocks) - were set to reform after 29 years of non-existence for two gigs in early 2009 until _after_ I started writing this post, but there you go. Things happen.

This track, "_[Shot By Both Sides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_By_Both_Sides)_", is one of the best debut singles ever. I know how I sound by that, like some John Cusack-type of character, but if you haven't heard it you must, immediately. Here's the original as written by Howard Devoto and Steve Shelley:

Incidentally, a few others have covered this, albeit live. Here's a cover by [Jarvis Cocker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis_Cocker):

And Radiohead's gone and done the very same:

All tracks will be deleted after a week. Enjoy!

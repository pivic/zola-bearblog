Did I have a wondrous weekend? Yes, I did.

Snuggled up with X, [Jeffrey Dahmer](http://letterboxd.com/film/the-jeffrey-dahmer-files) (well, sort of), [John Lydon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22911580-anger-is-an-energy) (_in literary form_) and a date at [Fotografiska](http://fotografiska.eu) where we tried their newly relaunched restaurant...oh, just too good to be true. Loads of calmness, including films. I'm blessed.

The exhibitions of photographic works by [Joyce Tenneson](http://www.tenneson.com) and [Anders Petersen](http://www.anderspetersen.se) were fantastic and realistic (yes, those worlds can intertwine); I dig Petersen's more but something must be said for Tenneson's incredible touch where the photographic meets the spiritual and ethereal; her presentation simply overcomes the doubts I had, which were simply based on every photograph I've ever seen where the word "spiritual" has proved to be a precursor to Bad photography. I adored her shots of old people, and a couple of those in gold simply shone warmth into me. Her "film", i.e. projections of shots while some "atmospheric" music was playing was a great thing, experienced just before heading off to dinner.

Below are a few pics from the culinary wonders that we had; I can't write how it felt sitting opposite to X, laughing, touching, loving. I won't, either, _ha!_

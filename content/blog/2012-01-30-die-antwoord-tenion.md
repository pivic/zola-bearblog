If I were a recording artist I'd be content with the name **Â¥o-Landi Vi$$er**.

Die Antwoord has finally produced an album that's really coherent, funny, gangsta and playful at once. If you haven't experienced them yet, check out the video for "_Fok Julle Naaiers_", one of the tracks off the new album:

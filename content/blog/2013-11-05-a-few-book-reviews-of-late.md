This is a really well-written book, and by that I mean loose language, non-pushy sell and reason. It's thinking loosely outside the box, in an intellectual way, putting facts behind words and personal experience as well. This is a real boon to workers and managers alike, who work using the internet.

With an introduction by Morrissey, a fan since the 1970s, this book encases the notion that Sparks' lyrics are poetry. Well, they _are_. Always dry, almost always funny, at times introspective and often philosophical, this is beyond pop despite it being just that. Well, not nowadays, and that's part of the fun. A good little read, not just once but repeatedly, as a reminder that most musical lyrics wouldn't stand a chance against this collection.

A really tormented story, quite strongly written and in non-chronological form, this is a cathartic tale of a person's youth as paved by her alcoholic, abusive mother, who in Sweden is a fairly well-known author of books on parenting.  
  
All in all: interesting and a very quick read, but I feel it could have fared much better if written differently, where the little emotions could have been given more range and depth.

One of my favourite films, ever. It's possible to quote endlessly from this book, but what this screenplay does add beyond the film, are the explanations on the characters' intents, notably during the final scene. Also, Robinson's explanations of the scenes are wonderfully humorous (and tragic, put it that way). Very well worth the cash.

My rating: [4 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/706661881)  
  
Vilket verk. Jag är verkligen glad över Handbergs samlande av berättelser, brev, notiser, dagboks- och memoarhandteckningar, muntliga redovisningar, o.s.v. som sammantaget betecknar von Kleists liv, som avslutades brutalt och ändå oerhört vackert.  
  
Glöm Werther. Här framstår en lidande poets tankar och vänskap, hans kärlek och liv, från hans hårda början till hans slut. Vackert berättat, framför allt genom von Kleists egna brev, men också genom hur Handberg har valt att presentera allt. En fin utgåva av Modernista.

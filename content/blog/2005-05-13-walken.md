[These](http://www.brandonbird.com/walken_letters.html) are letters from students to Christopher Walken. [This one](http://www.brandonbird.com/fear_of_god.html), and [this one](http://www.brandonbird.com/jony_dep.html) are my favourites.

A wonderful little fact about The Fall:

> The Fall are on Jools Holland's show next week. Mark E Smith is the only artist in the history of the show to have a clause in his contract inserted to state that Jools will not play boogie-woogie piano over any of his songs.

[Boing Boing reports](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/12/legal_fund_for_frenc.html) of a French blogger who's been arrested and charged for criticizing a city, that's now amassed _a lot of money_ to bring down the law on his head. Bitches!

[Here](http://homepage.mac.com/onegoodmove/movies/ds051205gaywatch.html)'s a great one. Jim West is the hypocritical republican mayor of Spokane, USA. Mr. West has historically been supporting a few interesting subjects, such as:

\* Barring gays from bars \* Opposing anti-gay discrimination laws \* Opposing partnership rights for gay city employees

[This little film](http://homepage.mac.com/onegoodmove/movies/ds051205gaywatch.html) shows why he's a hypocrite. I won't say too much, other than it involves gay.com and a "brutal outing" (Mr. West's quote). Also, don't miss Wolf Blitzer's "subtle" questioning of _the brain of the homosexual_.

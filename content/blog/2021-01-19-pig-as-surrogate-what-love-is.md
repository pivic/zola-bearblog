Cave art: [Celebes warty pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebes_warty_pig#Cave_art). This may be the oldest cave art known to humanity, approximately 45,500 years old.

I just heard an episode of BBC World Service: The Documentary, with the title [_My viral video and me_.](https://pca.st/episode/f1f4ab4e-5899-401b-8111-c5a7249b8c19)

In it, 33-year-old Colm Flynn interviews individuals who have had a 'viral hit', i.e. a video that suddenly rose to fame without being produced by someone who is already famous, a phenomenon that is, these days, both more seldom and more often seen than before.

Flynn asked one person what they felt when the 'love' that people sent via youtube comments dissipated over time.

When I listened to the documentary, it was clear to me that Flynn was sucked into fandom, a place where 'fame' often outweighs rational thinking. Sure, in the world of pop, rationality isn't worth much—which is, to me, as it should be—but to think a short and immediate comment is the same as love, is, to myself, profoundly vexing.

At the very least, if true, it would be extremely hyperkinetic; Imagine a world where we fully and completely absorb what others say about us. Then imagine thinking about what others may be saying about us. Extend that to think about what people have said about us in the past, how that plays into the present, and what might be said about us in the future. And then paint 'love' and 'hate' and other disparate and superlative words on thoughts, often without nuance.

In short: I don't think it's healthy to give a fuck about what other people think about you while I think care is super-healthy; it all depends on context and intention, both from the giver to the receiver.

Haven't we all confused good intention with malice at some point in our lives?

Flynn believes 'love' is in youtube comments. He may be right, but it's a flippant and vapid remark to make, as in 'What did you feel when the love died down?' when he (hopefully) meant 'What did you feel when people were no longer commenting on your youtube video en masse?'

Flynn interviewed Rebecca Black, famous for _Friday_, a low-budget video and song, that became extremely well-known in a short period of time. Black spoke of how negative comments online affected her at the time, when she was thirteen years old. She added that 'years of therapy' helped her feel better and be able to handle all of that.

Therapy. Not 'love' from [a machine that always ends up feeding its users right-wing hate](https://niklasblog.com/?p=24952).

Why can't we use pigs as surrogate parents for human babies?

We share most of our DNA with each other.

If we cast aside the biological trickery that must happen for this to be feasible, and also to answer my own question, I think the answer is: people would deem it unethical.

I think a lot of humans couldn't care less about a pig's suffering in the process. The same humans don't care about the suffering of human surrogate parents who do it for money, so imagine how little they have the capacities to care about an animal surrogate parent.

Part of me would love to know what, for example, the catholic church would say about a human who was born from an animal.

Imagine yourself as a follower of a religion that doesn't make room for things outside The Creator's comprehension: doesn't that point to the fact that the religion were completely made up by humans?

Ever since I was a little boy I had issues with religion. I mean, I grew up in a multi-cultural place, for which I am grateful. My friends and their families ushered me in and showed me a plethora of cultures that enriched my life and opened doors that I did not know to exist.

What I mean is this: religions are mostly barriers and not just rules. When a child and I came across a barrier, I asked myself why it existed. The most common answer was 'Because it's always been like that', which is, naturally, a shit answer. You fool no child with that answer: they see right through it.

What so-called grown-ups do when reinforcing that traditionalist mindset, is limit the capabilities of a child. I can't say I have many barriers myself, and I'd love to say I have none, but I know better; Some times I think life is one big game where the only rule is to try to remove all barriers before we die.

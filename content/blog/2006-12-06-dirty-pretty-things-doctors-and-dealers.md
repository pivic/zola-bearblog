![Dirty Pretty Things](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-12-06-dpt.jpg)When [The Libertines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Libertines) lay in rubble due to [Pete Doherty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Doherty)'s drug-abuse, the band's co-founding member, [Carl Barât](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Bar%C3%A2t), essentially grabbed the rest of the guys ((Save for John Hassall, who went on to found his own band, [Yeti](http://www.myspace.com/yetiintelligence).)) and formed [Dirty Pretty Things](http://www.dirtyprettythingsband.com).

Anything that differs DPT from The Libs? Yes. They're more rock 'n' roll in the scrawny sense, yet at the same time pertain some of the lyrical gist that Doherty carried away in the split, admonishing all that Barât had come a long way since the days of writing "[You're My Waterloo](http://hype.non-standard.net/track/134485)" (with Doherty). Since [Babyshambles](http://www.babyshambles.net), Doherty's band aprés Libs, released their debut album first, DPT got somewhat in the background due to their having no scandals for the mass-media to report of - but those in the know have accepted DPT's album as being very good in due course. _Time tells all_.

[The track](http://www.lyricsmania.com/lyrics/dirty_pretty_things_lyrics_7692/waterloo_to_anywhere_lyrics_25759/doctors_and_dealers_lyrics_308152.html) will be deleted in a week, so hop to it!

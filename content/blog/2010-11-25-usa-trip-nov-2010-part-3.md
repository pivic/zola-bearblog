**2010-11-11**

Yesterday was very special.

Riding on the long, high ramps of the freeways was daunting as much as the first time I ever rode a roller-coaster. All of my qualms of driving around in the middle of Stockholm city were crushed in comparison with rolling at 60 mph toward downtown Houston.

Before that, however, we visited Memorial Mall. It was quite big. Not as big as The Galleria, but still very impressive. Do keep in mind that I'm from tiny Sweden, where the corporate baby known as The Mall has really started festering a mere few years ago.

Memorial Mall had a lot of stores. Even had a train running inside the place, and a carousel. It was quite daunting, somewhat lending itself to an inferiority complex, something that kept on repeating throughout my US stay, mostly in Houston, not much in Austin.

We got downtown and tried to visit the Museum of Fine Arts. If I hadn't forgotten my wallet in the car, X probably wouldn't have been given advice not to enter the museum as it was only an hour left until they closed. So we strolled down Main Street and avoided the rain. A lot of rain. And the same night my mom texted me saying it was snowing in Stockholm.

We cruised through 5pm traffic, which means we creeped more than Eazy-E ever did; slow stuff! Right then, I was very grateful for driving a car with automatic transmission. Dinner at IHOP.

Today we're travelling to Austin. I can't wait.

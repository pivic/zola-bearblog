I thought _Murder in Plain English_ would be interesting.

This is from the start of the book:

'All indigent prostitutes'.

Now read from Hallie Rubenhold's _The Five_:

This is a clear example of what makes me stop reading a book.

Where Rubenhold has investigated matters thoroughly, _Murder in Plain English_ is anything but plain: instead, it plainly states that 'this book is written by two persons who have not done their research'.

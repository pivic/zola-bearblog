[![Hellraisers: The Life and Inebriated Times of Richard Burton, Richard Harris, Peter O'Toole, and Oliver Reed](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2013-01-22_1220-2.png "Hellraisers: The Life and Inebriated Times of Richard Burton, Richard Harris, Peter O'Toole, and Oliver Reed")](https://niklasblog.com/?attachment_id=12689)

First, I found "**[Hellraisers: The Life and Inebriated Times of Richard Burton, Richard Harris, Peter O'Toole, and Oliver Reed](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OA63EY)**", which may be a lot more tragic than it is interesting ((Or any form of learning experience.)). Then, I found [the graphic novel version](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906838364).

I'm intrigued. I wonder if it'll lead to more tragedy or to some actual knowledge beyond the GG Allin/Hunter S. Thompson-esque.

Nah, I'll skip the text. But the graphic novel looks interesting. Maybe it is, but I still won't pay for either of them. I've just had enough of these types of stories from people who've at least acted as though they're great and tough and wonderful, but are actually complete degenerates who've destroyed everybody around them.

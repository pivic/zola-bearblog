> A significant number of US high-school students regard their constitutional right to freedom of speech as excessive, according to a new survey.

Mad? Hell yes. Check [this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4225013.stm) on the facts that make up the above statement. It's an interview where 100000 youths get their say. It sounds like Dubya and friends have spawned their perfect gun-fodder robots.

I've just discovered [English Cut](http://englishcut.com), "the website of thomas mahon, bespoke savile row tailor, london." It's a quite interesting blog, where Mahon describes the pains and pleasures of being a Savile Row bespoke tailor. I love that word, "bespoke". Anyway, an excerpt of Mahon's straightforwardness:

> Regardless of who makes your suit, if you're paying over a certain amount you should make sure the coat is canvassed by hand. Otherwise you're being swindled.
> 
> If the tailor tells you a hand canvas is overrated or unnecessary, he is either incompetent or dishonest. Probably both. Turn around and leave his shop at once.

It's a killer blog so far. Mahon's the [Anthony Bourdain](http://www.anthonybourdain.com) of tailors. God, I wish I could have a suit made by this guy or somebody recommended by him.

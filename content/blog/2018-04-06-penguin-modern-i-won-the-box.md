About a month ago I got myself [the Penguin Little Black Classics box](https://niklasblog.com/?p=21323), and yesterday...I found out I've won [the Penguin Modern box](http://www.penguinmodern.com/list)!

I've now got a whole bunch of books from Penguin to read. My Bog. Anyway, this box is "merely" 50 books, in comparison with the staggeringly "Little Black Classics box"; physically speaking, it's about half the size of that...any way, it's daunting. But _I shall persevere_.

The books range from fiction to non-fiction, William S. Burroughs to Dorothy Parker, from Franz Kafka to Clarice Lispector.

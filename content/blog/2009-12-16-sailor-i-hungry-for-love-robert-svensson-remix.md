My mate Alexander and his band-mates Per and Tim in [Sailor & I](http://www.myspace.com/sailorandi) are constantly recording, and are both in the middle of recording their second EP (before the first one's even released, which will be the case in January 2010) and now Robert Svensson has remixed one track, "_Talking to a Wall_", off the first EP. This remix will included in _another_ EP which will only contain remixes! Here's the track re-vamped by Svensson.

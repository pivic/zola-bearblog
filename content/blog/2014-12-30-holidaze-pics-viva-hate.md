Just a bunch of pictures and a little text. Well, more, actually. The post expanded.

Blixa. Clearly her brightest face. She loves her bed that's attached to a radiator - now that there's heat in said radiator. She almost won't leave her bed for ours, but this morning I woke up with a bunch of paws ((Not belonging to X.)) across my back. By the way, I think her tongue's sticking out in this pic.

Shopping in Skanstull.

[![Viva Hate](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/20141228_215022-1024x576.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/20141228_215022.jpg)

The new Swedish three-episode TV-series named "[**Viva Hate**](http://www.svtplay.se/video/2549606/viva-hate/avsnitt-1)" ((Written by [Peter Birro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Birro), Morrissey fan.)) premiered this December. It's a series set in 1991, where four boys start a band, fuelled by Morrissey, The Smiths, The Clash and The Cult. I liked it, even though it had its ups and downs. In the pic above you'll probably spot at least one Morrissey poster. If I'd spot a fave bit in the series, it'd be the end of the second episode, where "_Now My Heart Is Full_" starts playing, right after - spoiler alert! - the lead character is kicked out of his band. Here's the track (no video from the show, though):

Here's a trailer of the ~6 first minutes of the first episode, with English subtitles:

Anyway. If you're a Moz fan you'll most likely enjoy that.

Another thing I've enjoyed a lot is Morrissey's "Lost":

This song is one of the best, ever. Not only among Morrissey's songs, but it's just the best. We're talking this good:

Please carry on enjoying your day. For my part, it's so far fairly calm. There are so few colleagues in the office that I feel like I'm home alone. I'm looking forward to cooking up some New Year's treats for X and myself.

_All is full of love._

Truly Yours, **Niklas**

I try not to write reissued, repackaged, repackaged.

Anyway, [Criterion are re-releasing this classic film](https://www.criterion.com/films/28734-a-taste-of-honey) in a week!

Even though I've written more on how [Shelagh Delaney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelagh_Delaney) - who wrote the play that the film is firmly based on - affected Morrissey/The Smiths [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=8852), I will leave you with [a quote of his](http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_111121_02):

> 'A Taste of Honey' was a sentiment that had not been expressed before its time - far more real than life. It was the Salford of sagging roofs, rag and bone men, walk-up flats, derelict sites, rear-entrance buses, and life in tight circumstances.

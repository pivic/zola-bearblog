I'd love [World Rally Championship 4](http://www.gametrailers.com/gt_vault/t_wrc4_w.html), as the trailer looks great, but then again it's more fun if more people can play, so here's to [SingStar 2](http://www.futuregamez.net/ps2games/singstarp/singstarp.html), a karaoke game for 1-8 players using two USB microphones. Check out the track list! It'll be great. Frederic and I are thinking of a night with friends, wine and food.

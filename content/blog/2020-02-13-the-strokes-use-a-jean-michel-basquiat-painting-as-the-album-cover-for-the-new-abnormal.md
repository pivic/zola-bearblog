Basquiat, Jean-Michel. 1981. “Bird on Money.” 1981. [https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-michel-basquiat/bird-on-money](https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-michel-basquiat/bird-on-money).

The Strokes have recently announced that they will release their new album, _The New Abnormal_, with cover art that's a detail of Jean-Michel Basquiat's painting _Bird on Money_.

I love Jean-Michel Basquiat.

Other artists: please use his shit more often. Thank you.

If I were a terrorist, looking to transfer money, I would know better than to use an "arab name", unlike what [whackos at Western Union](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060706/ap_on_bi_ge/emirates_muslim_money) think.

I wonder if they will take another step soon, e.g. forbid people with big noses to transfer money, or only permit Christian men with _proper names_ to use Western Union.

[David Koresh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Koresh), come back, all is (nearly) forgiven!

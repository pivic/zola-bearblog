I answered the tech support phone.

**Niklas**: Tech support, Niklas speaking. How may I help you? **User**: Hey there! I'd like to have Application X installed. Can you do that for me? **N**: I'm sorry, but Application X isn't known to us and is not included in our service catalogue. You will have to apply for it, to start with, according to policy. **U**: Oh, but I have to have it installed _today_.

A rushed installation date is almost never written in stone.

**N**: I understand. What is the software for? **U**: Eh, I don't know.

At this moment, I feared a [Monty Python And The Holy Grail-type of conversation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWS8Mg-JWSg), sans sane-ish answers.

**N**: How do you intend to use the software? **U**: Actually... I don't know. **N**: This may sound awkward, but I have to ask you: why are you requesting to have it installed? **U**: Because Person X told me to. **N**: Do you have any more information about the software, access to the installation media for this software, or knowledge of where it can be attained? **U**: Um, no. **N**: Please ask Person X to request the software with details as to why it should be installed, as we cannot help you today; at the moment, it's impossible to install the software, as it's not a part of our existing service catalogue. Also, we can't tell what it's for, from where it can be attained nor why you should have it installed.

Punchline time:

**U**: So... You won't install it now for me, will ya?

If I could have sent the user the above picture as an answer, I would have.

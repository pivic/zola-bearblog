The best social commentary you'll see. I mean, it's good to see stuff like Beyoncé's "_Formation_" but this is beyond that, and by beyond I mean **Morrissey** lays out the truth.

During the gig Moz spoke about how he rathers YouTube to the BBC and CNN. And it's plain to see why, really; you won't see exposés like the above on those networks.

The police...

You will, however, see them paired with the most combative opposition to the industrial animal-killing there is, at a Morrissey concert.

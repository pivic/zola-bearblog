When walking home yesterday evening, a person standing across the street shouted at me for attention and then asked me if I had a phone. Yes, I replied. She walked sideways, and I saw the silhouette of a woman behind her.

As I moved towards them, it became clear that the woman was lying on the ground. She seemed delirious, wobbling repetitively.

The person who beckoned me said the woman didn't know her own name or where she lived and seemed like she might be in shock. What seemed like her bag laying beside her was half-emptied onto the street. A pair of gloves and a few letters were at her feet. The woman looked at me with a completely blank, innocent face.

"Are you alright?", I asked. "Fuck you. You fucking shit-sack." she replied. "Bastard." "Are you cold? Would you like to have your gloves?" I replied. "Go home. And! Then fuck _yourself_."

Right you are. I called the police, who asked if the woman was drunk. I said I couldn't tell, but added that she was indeed delirious. The cops said they'd come to pick her up. Fifteen minutes of verbal abuse and stinging cold weather later, I called the police again, who informed me that a patrol-car was on the way: "We're there straight away unless an armoured truck gets robbed before they reach you!"

The woman lunged at my bag but I was quicker than she. This vexed her.

"You cunt", she told the person next to me. "You hard cunt. You think you're such a good person. You're _not_. You're just a cunt."

We sighed.

"Fuck straight off! Do as I say! Fuck off! You...you...youuu..."

After ten minutes the cops came to pick her up. She didn't say a word when they came by. I left her to her destiny. I hope she's feeling a lot better today even though I somehow doubt it.

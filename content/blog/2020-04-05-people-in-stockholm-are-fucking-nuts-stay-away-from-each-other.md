The Public Health Agency in Sweden has since some time [stated that old people should stay home](https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=4916&artikel=7430726).

In other words: order shit to your home regardless of whether you're old or not, have somebody help you out if you're old and alone, and don't go out.

Even if you're not afraid of getting sick, don't go out, because you might spread COVID-19 to somebody who might die or spread the virus to others.

COVID-idiot to the left, my idiot self to the right

On Friday, I went to the supermarket.

The supermarket had printed massive posters telling people to stay at least 1.5 meters away from each other.

While queuing, this idiot behind me started standing closer and closer to me. When he was ten centimetres away from me—appx. fifteen times closer than the supermarket recommendation—I politely told him that he was standing too close to me and, please, would he move back?

He just looked at me. I then suspected that he didn't know Swedish. I asked, in English, him if he spoke English or Swedish. He just looked down. He didn't look drunk or lost at all. I then told him to stand back. He didn't.

Another person came in and told the man to keep his distance, that it's important because people could infect him and he could infect others.

'But I'm not sick', he said, in perfect Swedish.

Instagram-story post from a Swedish person who states that 'my friend is infected and we hung out on Saturday. But I feel healthy!'. I messaged her and asked her whether this is true or not and pointed out what she's obviously doing wrong if she's joking. She hasn't replied. Her Instagram account is now private.

I told him that he could not know whether he had COVID-19, that he was putting others in dangers by acting the way he did, that he was violating both the supermarket's proximity rule and what The Public Health Agency in Sweden states.

He didn't move.

I told him that I was taking precautions to make sure he didn't violate rules and common decency further; I placed my empty plastic grocery carrier on the floor so that he couldn't move closer to me and kept my foot on it as I gently moved away; he actually tried to move over it but couldn't.

I can't believe that I had to keep an old person away from me because that person was acting insanely.

I believe his stupidity stopped him from acting rationally.

I'm all for idiots killing themselves, but please, don't do that to others. I'm not thinking about myself; if I'm infected, I can order food to my home and I'm lucky enough to have money to see me through.

If an idiot like the above person infects me, I might infect somebody else who might die or suffer horrible consequences, e.g. infect their child or something like it.

Swedish Democrat (=racist and extreme-right-wing political party) politician [Claus Zaar](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_Zaar) wears a home-made visor, saying 'I'm completely healthy, the visor protects me, I'm not going to isolate myself.'

The idiots must be called out for what they're doing. It's not about shaming, it's about saving lives and preventing the pandemic as much as we can.

This Scottish instruction should serve as both comedy cold and a reminder of what counts.

Naturally, all of this is not about Stockholm. It's about how everybody has to act. We need to thwart the spreading of everything bad.

I remember dad coming home from the training camp in Leksand, north of Stockholm, Sweden. [The Yugoslavian football team had just been thrown out of the European Championships](http://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/05/31/Yugoslavia-barred-from-European-Championships/3160707284800/) because of sanctions imposed by the EU. The same sanctions prevented all gasoline companies from loading the plane that was to fly the team out of Sweden, while at Arlanda airport; really, all but one, Statoil. Which the players had to pay. In cash. They happened to have that money then. Before Dinars were about as valuable as German money used to be, circa WW2.

The players went by plane, not knowing their future, or just how harrowed and split-up their country would be. What would be where. Who would be what, and to whom.

So they went by plane to a place called hom, and NATO went after by plane and illegally bombed Serbia for 78 days straight, setting a record by doing that.

My dad went home by car, not plane. He lived and lives in Sweden. I remember SÃ„PO, the Swedish "secret" police, before the training camp was held, calling him at insane hours of the day, asking which players would be travelling to Sweden. He told them to go to hell and check a flight itinerary instead. In the end he obliged. He had no choice.

Serbia did not have a choice. The USA joined in, bombing away as part of NATO.

Now Statoil is changing its name to Circle K, as it's been sold and bought by a bigger entity.

It's a second bombing, of sorts. The attack of the corporations. [Not that this is new in any way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ou9rOssPg). It's just sad, in an economically criminal sense of the word. Makes me remember Morrissey's nationalistic words: "Everything went downhill from the moment the McDonald's chain was allowed to invade England."

Wow. Neko Case, k.d. lang and Laura Veirs are releasing an album. It's sounds a lot like Neko's prior stuff, even though I must confess I'm not familiar with lang and Veirs. Here's the first track, "_Atomic Number_":

I'm not sure of the longevity of the track, but the jump-off from the start of the chorus along with the sheer reverb and melodies of the track, make me guess the album will be wondrous.

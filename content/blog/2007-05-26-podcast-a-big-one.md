So, what have I spent doing this morning? Yep, making a new podcast for you!

I've adorned this track with my voce, speaking of and playing Voxtrot, The Tough Alliance, Ping Pong Bitches, Dondole, Ceephax, Okkervil River, Manic Street Preachers, Marcus Berg, Vive La Fàªte, LCD Soundsystem/Franz Ferdinand, Dan Deacon, New Young Pony Club, Ash and (of course) Bonde Do Role.

If you use iTunes or/and a fairly new iPod, I believe you should get [this file](http://www.divshare.com/download/741931-01e) as it's prepared for those platforms: you'll get album covers, links, correct names and chapters for every single track. Yep, I've put my heart and soul into this ish.

If you don't use iStuff, just download or stream this track right here:

The tracks will be gone in a week's time. All comments are appreciated.

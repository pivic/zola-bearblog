When visiting a public bathroom that consists of one room for men and another room for women, I rarely pick the one for women, even when the men's room is busy and the women's is free. I get scared of the idea that someone would find out that I'd been somewhere I shouldn't have been.

I hate the fact that many public bathrooms are gender specific.

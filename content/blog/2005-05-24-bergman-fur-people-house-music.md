Ingmar Bergman is getting his big info-desk on the web. This new website is opening in September, and can be reached through [this link](http://www.ingmarbergman.se). I've already downloaded the screen-saver with Bergman quotes to take the cloudy edges off our currently dark and rain-filled Swedish skies.

Now, I've discovered [the Fur people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_people). I nearly laughed myself to pieces when I read "The Fur are a people of the western Sudan", but I love "They speak Fur" and "The Furs' lifestyle". I'm just thinking of [Tribbles](http://members.cox.net/mokwella/classic/tribbles.jpg)!

A Swedish club called Mixed Feelings are posting DJ-sets online, to be downloaded. [Go on](http://www.mixedfeelings.nu/mix.html#). **edit**: the MP3's are reported to contain a lot of audible "ID3 tag garbage inside stream" and "mpeg stream error" errors, according to [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org); the tracks are hence badly ripped.

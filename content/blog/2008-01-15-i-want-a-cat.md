Blaah. I just saw the above video on [Seesmic](http://seesmic.com) and almost got tears in my eyes. I've owned two [Cornish Rex](http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/cornish.html) cats, but became allergic to them after six months. Nothing says I'd stand a [Sphynx](http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/sphynx.html) (i.e. the breed in the video), but I'd love that to be true.

Yesterday I went to town to see [Nina Persson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Persson), [Ebbot Lundberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebbot_Lundberg) and [Magnus Carlson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlson) play a tribute to The Velvet Underground [as part of Stockholms Kulturfestival](http://kulturfestivalen.stockholm.se/program/details.php?AID=679).

It was lovely! They played tracks I didn't recognise - not that I'm a Velvets zealot in the least - and some that I love, e.g. "_Who Loves The Sun_" and "_Sunday Morning_". I shot some video, so here you go. Sadly, you will hear me belting out words that don't necessarily fit with what the artists sang...

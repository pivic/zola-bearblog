...says the rock star after marrying in 2003, having five kids and then playing what he's described as Blur's best gigs ever.

I'm not buying it.

I mean, being married is part of rock 'n' roll. It's rock 'n' roll, _literally_. Some people die as they marry but that's just a blip on an otherwise clear downward trajectory.

No, marriage is sacred to me as it's more than rock 'n' roll, flowers und romance. It's a bond. But it's what you do when you're married that defines you, not the word itself.

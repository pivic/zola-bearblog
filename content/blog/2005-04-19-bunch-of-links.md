Here's a link-fest for you, raped off the fields of other Internet blogs.

[David Fincher is apparently going to direct "Zodiac"](http://chud.com/news/2533), a film about the American serial-killer. Very interesting indeed, considering Fincher made "Seven". If you don't know anything about that film, _see it_.

Speaking of films, Coming Soon reports [a few pictures](http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=9242) from the set of "V For Vendetta", the coming film that's based on the book by Alan Moore and David Lloyd.

[ni9e](http://www.ni9e.com) has just released the "Explicit Contents Only Version" of [N.W.A.'s "Straight Outta Compton"](http://www.mp3.com/albums/145607/summary.html). Go DL it now!

Are you into Calvin & Hobbes? Wait just a tad longer. On 2005-10-05, [this shocker](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0740748475) is released: 1440 pages of everything that is Calvin & Hobbes.

Are you into truth? Get [a fact shirt](http://www.factshirt.com). Here's what's on them:

> Fact Shirt is a socially responsible business created in response to the declining state of U.S. foreign and domestic policy, and the feeling of helplessness brought on by watching a chorus of corporate-owned media recite the government's lies in unison.
> 
> To put it simply, we felt there were some important facts missing from the public policy dialogue in America (come to think of it, the entire dialogue is missing).

The next version of Photoshop, CS2, is on its way. In it, there's a cool feature called "Vanishing Tool". Check it out in action [here](http://www.photoshopsupport.com/tutorials/tt-cs2/vanishing-point.html). Just click the dog picture to see a step-by-step QuickTime film on how it works.

Now to a couple of work-unsafe URL's. First, there's [Beautiful Agony](http://www.beautifulagony.com). This site shows faces of people who experiences _the little death_. If that's too French for you, check out [these bukkake cookies](http://www.porn-bread.com/bukkake.htm).

To finish off, [here](http://www.durhamtownship.com)'s a site that shows dreamy pictures of a little city in America.

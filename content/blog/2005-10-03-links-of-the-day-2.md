PC World has posted their "[The 100 Best Products of 2005](http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,120763,pg,12,00.asp)", ranging from e-mail systems to routers, spam-protection suites to MP3-players and desktop search software to DVD-burners.

From that list, I found [Password Agent](http://www.moonsoftware.com/pwagent.asp), a password storage program that's very neat. Small, offering 256-bit AES/Rijndael-encryption and a load of tiny, effective features, I suggest you check it out. Oh, and if you have a USB-memory with you and need your passwords, check out this feature that's very handy:

> Encrypted password database files, accessible only via user selectable master password (for enhanced security, master password is used as encryption/decryption key only and is not stored anywhere). You can also assign a short master password hint text so if you accidentally forget your master password, the hint will help you to recall it.

Apparently I'm the only nerd in the village who thinks that [Office 12 is getting native PDF-file support implemented](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1866160,00.asp) is cool. Yeah, it means you'll be able, just as [OpenOffice 2.0](http://www.openoffice.org) already has, built-in functions to export the file you're working with as a PDF-file.

Another cool thing about Office 12 is that [the preview site](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview) is open and accepting applications for the first beta of Office 12. On [this page](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/developers/filefaq.mspx), I discovered that the coming new file-extensions (i.e. forget about .DOC, .XLS and Ye Olde Formatse) are to let you know that the files produced (by default) in Office 12 are built using the OpenXML-standard, and that the files are compressed using ZIP-technology upon saving, and are uncompressed during opening. This, according to Microsoft, should make the files 50-75% smaller than they are today. It also means you can open default-saved Office 12-files in any application that accepts the standard XML-format. But, if you're using a version of MS Office that's not the latest one, you've got to use a converter if you want to open files created in Office 12:

> Q. Will there be an XML file converter for people using previous releases that don't support XML? A. Yes. Microsoft will release converters for Microsoft Office 2000, Microsoft Office XP, and Microsoft Office 2003, so customers using previous releases of Microsoft Office will be able to open files created using the new file formats.

This means that if you're using Office 97 and would like to open a Office 12-created file - boo-ya! Bad luck to you. On the other hand I understand Microsoft; they wanna make money and as the OpenXML-format is in fact smart and a lot better one than the old formats, I say go for it. Besides, Office 97 is nine years old. That's a lot of time.

Now to something completely different: it's...[30GB's of mailbox](http://www.30gigs.com). Go for it.

Harvey Danger has released their new album on the Internet, totally free of charge. Read the press-release [here](http://harveydanger.com/press/why.php), or just get the album [here](http://www.harveydanger.com/downloads). I've heard it before, and I didn't like it. The reason? MOR USA BORE.

By no way, I wonder if Numark have brought in [this turntable](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000190061514) just to fuck with purists' minds; it contains a hard-drive, gives you the ability to scratch your music and also to auto-tag them using the Gracenote database.

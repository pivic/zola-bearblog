I actually really like [my Pelikan Souverän Stresemann M400](https://niklasblog.com/?p=17883), and it's very, very fine with its big B nib. However, yesterday, thanks to the powers of Lukas, I bought his M800, which is a slightly larger pen:

The ink above is [Pilot's Iroshizuku Murasaki-Shikibu](https://www.gouletpens.com/pilot-iroshizuku-murasaki-shikibu-50ml-bottled-fountain-pen-ink/p/PN69221).

I love the length and the F nib that goes with it. I'm so used to [my Platinum 3776](https://pivic.exposure.co/the-past-week/photos/353881) with its EF nib, which is - in Pelikan's world - something like a super-EF nib. The M800 is great to write with, and due to how the nib is designed, one can hold it _upside-down_ to write with a lot thinner nib size. It's almost like having two pens in one.

When I press the nib, something really happens. It's a very sensitive pen, and it feels as though it'll work forever. Pressing hard onto paper results in more ink. No waste, no drool, and it's excellent on my non-feathering TWSBI paper.

Now, all I need is a [Platinum Izumo Biwatame (Tan) Urushi Fountain Pen](https://nibsmith.com/product/platinum-izumo-biwatame-tan-urushi-fountain-pen)...

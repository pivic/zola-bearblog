[![Not featured in the song!](http://static.flickr.com/27/48569057_77b74d60b4_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=48569057) I thought I'd give you more songs than before, so starting tonight I'm going to aim at releasing one song a week, which will be available for a week only, before it's ejected.

The track "Groovin' With Mr. Bloe" is a rarity in itself. The illustrious Mr. Bloe is said to be a certain Harry Pincher, the man who plays the harmonica on the track. Believe it or not, but very little is known other than that, the fact that the track was made in 1970...and gets engraved in your mind as soon as you've heard it once. Here's a description I found on the net:

> Nothing but bass, harmonica and groove - not funk, not rhythm, but groove in excelsis, and sometimes that's enough.

How true. Searching for information on this song on the Internet either requires somebody with infinite patience, more skill or...there just isn't any available. One of the cached Google hits, however, was an old post written by...me. Allow me the rancidity to quote my old self:

> I just got hold of Mr. Bloe's “Groovin' With Mr. Bloe". For those of you who haven't heard it, it's a musical masterpiece. Not even reaching three full minutes, it pumps a steady piano vamp, a grinding non-fuzzed electric bass and a“¦harmonica that leads the melody. The gentleman \[who made it\] is Harry Pincher, a person who is probably most well-known for laying down the harmonica on the song, which I stumbled across as I read an interview with Morrissey a few years ago, where he talked far and wide of the genius of it. True, the second time I saw Mozza this song was played just before he ran onstage. Anyway, it's brilliant. The importance of the song has built over time.

Yeah, [Morrissey loves the track](http://vu.morrissey-solo.com/moz/gig/intro.htm), and so do plenty of other people. I was thrilled with opening a copy of Q Magazine a couple of years ago, only to find an entire column dedicated to the track in question.

A Swedish band, [Robert Johnson and Punchdrunks](http://www.robertjohnsonandpunchdrunks.com), have covered the track and released it as a single. [Here](http://www.robertjohnsonandpunchdrunks.com/video/Groovin.wmv)'s the video for their version. As some might hear, Tomas à–berg from the Swedish, massively influential, Pixies-devotees [bob hund](http://www.silence.se/bobhund).

Anyway, on with the show. You shan't keep a great track waiting. Any comments are appreciated!

**edit**: the audio has been deleted as it's lived long enough.

**edit 2**: finally, enlightenment. The man who made "Groovin' With Mr. Bloe" is [Harry Pitch](http://harmonica.co.uk/harry.htm).

Even though it's currently available for purchase on vinyl, the electronic version of **[Kavinsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavinsky)**'s debut album, "_Outrun_", drops tomorrow. Here's a taster with bits from the entire album:

It's co-produced by SebastiAn, one of my fave electronic artists. The album can prove to be a really nasty trip to the 1980s! There's even a synopsis for this synth-lead rock opera ((Taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outrun_(album)).)):

> Outrun is the debut album by French house artist Kavinsky. The album is set to release on 25 February 2013. The name is a reference to Sega's 1986 arcade game OutRun, which featured the Testarossa. Outrun has a running theme which refers to Kavinsky's backstory of a man who crashes his Ferrari Testarossa resulting in him becoming a zombie who produces electronic music. Kavinsky cites influences from 80's videogames and TV cop shows such as Xmi Vice, and describes the record as 'cold' sounding.

I think the album will drop at [Kavinsky's Bandcamp](http://kavinsky.bandcamp.com) page tomorrow. Hopefully! It's most likely already out on iTunes.

As Morrissey's greatest hits-album has been leaked will soon hit the record shops, one of the two new extra tracks, "_All You Need Is Me_", has particularly striking lyrics. As usual, the man is at his prime when he snarls and bites.

This should serve as a template for anybody attempting to write song-lyrics these days.

> You hiss and groan and you constantly moan but you don't ever go away And that's because all you need is me
> 
> You roll your eyes up to the skies mock horrified but you're still here all you need is me
> 
> There's so much destruction all over the world and all you can do is complain about me
> 
> You bang your head against the wall and say you're sick of it all yet, you remain 'cause all you need is me
> 
> And then you offer your one and only joke and you ask me "What will I be, when I grow up to be a man?"
> 
> Me? NOTHING
> 
> There's a soft voice singing in your head Who can this be? I do believe it's me
> 
> There's a naked man standing laughing in your dreams You know who it is But you don't like what it means
> 
> There's so much destruction all over the world and all you can do is complain about me
> 
> I was a small, fat child in a welfare house there was only one thing I ever dreamed about fate has just handed it to me
> 
> WHOPEE
> 
> You don't like me but you love me either way you're wrong You're gonna miss me when I'm gone you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
> 
> You don't like me but you love me either way you're wrong You're gonna miss me when I'm gone you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Ended in bouts of _lalala_ and _rrao_.

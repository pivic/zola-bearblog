Here are some words on my 16:th Spotify playlist, titelled "**Carinha, come home**".

I love that Mystery Jets song. Their entire new album, "Radlands", has a big picture of Texas on the cover and one of the songs are called "_Lost in Austin_". Fair enough. This song is like Mystery Jets' version of Okkervil River's "_Plus Ones_", album title-dropping all throughout the song.

Nico. Almost forgot about her, which should be criminal. She's like [Dolph Lundgren's "Ivan Drago"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaMu6NldFCw) in the voice, but loving, stale and somehow haunted. And the music is Velvet Underground at its best. It. One unit. Nico, what freaking times.

Shostakovich! I became aware of him when [Morrissey sampled the hell out of him](https://niklasblog.com/?p=2776) for "_The Teachers Are Afraid Of The Pupils_". This song is so beautiful, even though I must tip you of the very recently released "Shostakovic Piano Concertos", worth every penny. A 5/5-review is found [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/feb/09/shostakovich-melnikov-faust-mco-review).

Black Mountain has just dropped their soundtrack for the film "**Year Zero**". The soundtrack is, however, comprised of songs from their first three albums. But this track, "Bright Lights", is so thematic, pieced together from so many ideas and just Ennio Morricone-ish, hippie and hardcore Black Sabbath, that it's just meant to be played loudly as hell.

Franke, the Swedish band that seems destined to be quite unknown and that played a blinding set at the Way Out West festival a few years back, don't disappoint. Check them out, please.

While The Soundtrack of Our Lives are now releasing their last album, this is the song that broke them. As they wanted to release a quintuple debut album. _Aaaaaaaaa._

I'm sure Morrissey isn't glad about the fact that the newly reissued "**Viva Hate**" - perhaps his most underestimated album - didn't make it into the top 100. Never mind, songs like "_Everyday Is Like Sunday_" make it epic in the true sense; Stephen Street's production, bass-playing and remastering skills are sublime. Vini Reilly's music and guitar-playing - and, of course, Morrissey's lyrics and _sotto voce_ - makes this soar far above badmouthing. It's like the best way to describe kitchen sink in words, and touches everybody.

I fell in love with Bowie's "_Queen Bitch_" the moment it played in the film "**The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou**":

At my new job a very clever colleague is very into hip-hop, and due to that, I recently listened to this old song by Dilated Peoples. Almost too old-school for me now, in the sense that it's been done before, but the production, the use of scratching as a weapon and like a lead guitar, the flows, the lyrics, the surrealism - it just goes a little way to explain why I sometimes think hip-hop can be my favourite way of avant garde music.

Hardfloor. This song just grows, grows and overtakes. It owns everything, and suddenly you're in it. And you can't move.

The old Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds track is sombre, sad and made me feel so old when I first heard it. But I think it's just beautiful now. I couldn't ever bring myself to write sad music like this, and pull it all off. I think "**The Boatman's Call**", the album on which this track rests, is the the best the band's done.

Nada Surf. Do you remember "_Popular_"?

High school, dissonant riffs, catchy as hell. Now, X introduced me to "_Waiting For Something_" through Patrick. Oh. My. Word. It's such a great, great track. The chorus just owns everything.

And here's a beautifully filmed and performed version of "_Waiting For Something_":

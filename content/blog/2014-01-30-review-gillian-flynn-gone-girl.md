"I know, I know, I’m being a girl."

People like this book. A lot seem to really enjoy it. I know David Fincher is on his way to direct a filmed version of the book.

I can't like it. The book, at its core, is a version of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes short story called "[The Problem of Thor Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_of_Thor_Bridge)". Having said that, I'm surprised with how inundated I was with the author's attempts to make Amy a hip character, but really ended up with a faded, dated person; sure, I think some things were sweetly - and horridly also, in a good sense of the word - described in the book, to a good extent, but when most of the words in this story are filler for a good plot, I wish it could have been better than this.

There are so many author's tricks applied throughout the book, reading it felt like a 100 yard hurdle race.

Also, I'm a bit concerned with many of the antifeministic things in the book, dialogue or not:

> It’s a very female thing, isn’t it, to take one boys’ night and snowball it into a marital infidelity that will destroy our marriage?

> I know, I know, I know that losing a job is incredibly stressful, and particularly for a man \[...\]

> ‘I hope you have friends, relatives, who are looking out for you during this, Nick,’ she said, swatting a horsefly. ‘Men forget to take care of themselves. Comfort food is what you need.’

> I thought the unkind thought, one of those that burbled up beyond my control. I thought: Women are fucking crazy. No qualifier: Not some women, not many women. Women are crazy.

> I didn’t give you the benefit of the doubt: that no matter how much you and I blunder, you always love me and want me to be happy. And that should be enough for any girl, right?

> You don’t ever want to be the wife who keeps her husband from playing poker – you don’t want to be the shrew with the hair curlers and the rolling pin.

> Gilpin rolled his eyes toward me; I almost expected him to make a joke – sounds like someone’s on the rag – the guy was laying it on so thick.

All in all: it's stupid entertainment with a nicely twisted plot. I prefer something by Warren Ellis, Walter Mosley or Agatha Christie.

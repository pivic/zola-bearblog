“[**Get Your War On**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Your_War_On)” is my favourite comic strip that dealt with “9/11” and the aftermath. I loved (and still love) how it displayed fear, insanity and gutlessness of what happened from an American perspective.

David Rees, the creator, used simple office clip-art-like frames to display and make us laugh at the horrors that came about after the twin towers went down.

This morning, while getting ready to go to work, I happened to find an early paperback collection of some of these strips, which I really laughed out loudly at, while reminiscing, thinking how they were still valid, in time.

Here are a few clips from the beginning of the series. If you want more, “_Get Your War On_” is available [at David Rees' own site](http://www.mnftiu.cc/category/gywo/) and has been published in book form, with the author's royalties (as well as part of the publisher's income for the first book and Get Your War on II) being donated to the charity Adopt-A-Minefield for removal of landmines in Afghanistan.

As the author had promised, the strip ended the day that [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush) left office, January 20, 2009.

David Rees is a hero and deserves to always be lauded for this strip.

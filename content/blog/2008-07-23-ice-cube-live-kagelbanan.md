I lived to tell the tale, wesssiiiiiide!

On Monday evening, Zak came over to X's and my apartment to showcase his crip walk, to watch a bit of "Up In Smoke" and even more of the better DVD "Awesome: I Fuckin' Shot That!". We had pizza, talked and laughed, demolished the crip walk and went into town to meet Rade and Rivan. We also met Kuba by fluke, but he wasn't going to see the Cube.

We all went down into Kägelbanan where we had missed [Kartellen](http://www.myspace.com/kartellen), who claim to be the only gangsta rap outfit in Sweden. No tears lost. We waited around until the time came for the fat nigga we love to hate to make his way on the stage. What a bizarre choice to pick Kägelbanan, which can merely house appx. 500 people, if not less! The show sold out a few days back, and it felt strange and great to finally see the man live. It was fun to hear old tracks like "_The Nigga Ya Love To Hate_" and the new "_Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It_".

After the show Rade and Rivan went home as they worked yesterday, but Zak, X and myself took time talking and drinking at Mosebacke, later at the damned sunkhak also known as Högbergs. It was close to Mosebacke, which is the only reason ever to venture there and drink.

Here's a little 42-minute video I shot during the show. Expect all and nothing, plus the usual assortment of shoddy camera-handling... Cheers, and I hope you were there!

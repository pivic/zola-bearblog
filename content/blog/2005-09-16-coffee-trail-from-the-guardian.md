[This article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1571374,00.html) from The Guardian is brilliant. A little study on poverty, coffee and corporations in Ethiopia. Check it out. Here's a synopsis, from The Guardian:

> To find the place where coffee began, you travel to Ethiopia, and drive out west, to the village of Choche, and then you abandon the car and follow a dirt track up into the hills. After a while, as the altitude increases, you strike off along a narrow, heavily overgrown trail. You hike along it for a quarter of an hour, and then, suddenly, you're there: the physical spot where, according to nearly every legend, the stimulating effect of the coffee bean was first discovered, fuelling centuries of trade and war and politics and fashion, and giving birth to a world in which, today alone, approximately 2.5bn cups of coffee will be consumed. This is what you see: overgrown grass. A few rocks. Some puddles. The Ethiopian government identified the location a few years ago, and hopes to develop it - one plan involves building a hotel - but so far nothing has materialised in a country marred by famine, cyclical drought, and myriad more pressing financial priorities.

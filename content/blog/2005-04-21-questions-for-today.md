[![Experience my dark side! Eeeugh.](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-21-popeemperorthumb.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-21-popeemperor.jpg)Today is emergency phone day, and here are my nominees for the best questions that I have been asked today. The first quote starts a bit into the conversation, when it turns interesting:

> User: Why is it snowing? Me: Well...I think that's sad, but soon enough we'll probably have sunshine! U: No, but really, why is it snowing outside? M: \[perplexed for a second\] Well, is it snowing in-doors? U: \[counter-perplexive\] Well, why? M: \[riposte-perplexion\] Why well?

If the user, at this point, would have started ranting about wells, I would have let her won, totally. But we went on for a bit more:

> U: \[perplexed straight\] What? M: \[skipping the Monty Pythonesqueness of the situation\] Do you really want to know why it's snowing outside? U: Well, yes. M: I think it's because the new pope wanted it to be that way. U: Oh, well then.

I didn't go into matters further. The second question, which wasn't really one:

> User: Oh hello, my name is \[X\] and my computer is making a little sound like a hum...and I think there's something wrong with my computer, and anyway, what I really called about is this really strange mail I got, and oh wait, never mind, now I'm logging into the computer, thanks anyway, bye.

The third and last nominee:

> Me: IT department, Niklas speaking. User: Well well, there you go. M: Pardon? U: Oh never mind! Hahaha, I'm just waiting for my computer to finish loading. M: Are you experiencing problems with your computer? U: Well...I'm waiting for it to start up...I didn't know if it would, so I thought it best to call you. M: Is it taking a long time to start up? U: No, not really. M: Is there anything suspicious about the start up-procedure that made you call us? U: No. M: OK! Should anything out of the ordinary arise, just call us. Otherwise, you don't have to. U: OK!

Weird enough for one day, maybe?

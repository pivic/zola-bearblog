I dreamed last night. Here are the facts.

I thought of getting a word misspelled on a Swedish assignment when I was eight years old. The word was "almanacka" but I spelled it "almenacka". The exact moment when I got it back, corrected in red ink, stood out like a sore head in my dream, frozen in time.

_Did I raise us? Kind of?_

I also dreamed up a short-film where a human rolls its tongue, a close-up, and in the dream I realised that this singular motion, captured in near-technicolor, was a lot better than the Disney film I saw last night.

_I heard you're leaving early._

The colour of our sails was turquoise. We sailed in true optimism, doing it all by ourselves. We weren't heading anywhere. The sky was clearly blue, tinted with small clouds.

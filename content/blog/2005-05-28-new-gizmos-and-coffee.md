I decided that a digital system camera would cost my life (and a half, considering Mikaela's and my vacation is starting in a few weeks) and allow me to live on noodles for the rest of the month, I gave up on that - for this month. That camera is still lingering in my mind. I've seen so many Nikon D70 and Canon 350D-images that I've started to tell the difference apart from mere glances of the shots. Generally speaking, the 350D provides more sparkling images and higher resolution, but the D70 gives less distortion when using the standard lenses.

So, I bought something else. Something less expensive. For the past years I've been using the same type of mouse, a Logitech optical mouse, but now I've upgraded to a [Logitech MX518](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm?PAGE=products/details&CONTENTID=10121&CRID=2142), the latest monster. This one's first and foremost made for gamers; even though I'm definitely not a hardcore frag-master, this also does come in handy when just browsing the web. Little buttons easily enables the user to go back and forth through pages and another couple of buttons increases and decreases the sensitivity. The mousepad is also excellent.

I also bought a new brand of espresso: Pascucci. [People seem to like it](http://www.xpressivo.com/theespressoguide/coffeetalk.asp?id=1117). I won't link you to their web page. If you do find it, you'll be sorry. The first page loads a java plug-in to produce a water reflection of their logo, while trying to play a MIDI file. After you've clicked "ENTER", the second page wants to play a QuickTime film. Jesus. I hate badly coded web pages. Why litter them with stuff which merely indicates that the page in question is not worth visiting? The more junk, the less content, right? Weirdly enough, the coffee's good though. I decided to try another brand than my usual, [Segafredo](http://www.segafredo.it), which is a really good espresso coffee. Sadly, Pappa Ray Ray are switching from Segafredo Extra Strong to [Monteriva](http://www.monteriva.se), which is not really fit to drink as an espresso. It's much too bitter, sour and lacking of character. The crema should not even be mentioned in polite conversation. I understand Pappa Ray Ray, though. Their supplier of Segafredo has gone into hiding and apparently behaves way less than a professional supplier should, not answering telephone calls, and what have you not. Sad situation, people. I may have to bring my Segafredo beans to work.

Oh, check out pictures of the mouse, the new coffee (...) and of Mikaela's lovely plants, right [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-05-28).

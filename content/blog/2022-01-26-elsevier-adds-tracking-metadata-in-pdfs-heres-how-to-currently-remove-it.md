Why do Elsevier add this metadata? They want to track people who use 'their' PDFs and know who's shared what.

I've listed some of my problems with Elsevier in [this post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=22812). Now, they want to track people. Privacy isn't about hiding something: it's about _control_.

Note: Elsevier might change their tracking methods at any point in time, rendering this script useless. Search Internet for the latest information on what Elsevier are up to in trying to track you and visit [EFF](https://www.eff.org/pages/surveillance-self-defense).

Here's the script as mentioned in the tweet above via its GitHub location:

P.s. Elsevier are far from the only company that do this.

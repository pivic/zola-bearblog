[Arfa Karim Randhawa](http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/content/binary/image0021234567.jpg) has, at _nine years of age_, become the youngest person ever to become a Microsoft-certified engineer. Because of that, she got to meet Bill Gates. When asking him why there are very few women working in the company, [Bill G. said "it is sometimes difficult to get women interested in technology"](http://www.neowin.net/comments.php?id=29480).

Oh, really? Not likely, I say. Microsoft is the biggest company in the world, income-wise. MS, if you truly want women to work at your corporation, do what you're good at: _generate interest_.

By the way, check out the interesting user comments [at the Neowin site](http://www.neowin.net/comments.php?id=29480) about this; some people have no clue about how people live and are obviously very envious about Randhawa's certification (and her C# programming skills); just goes to show how prejudice takes over when the intellect stops responding.

[![Idiot spammers](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2011-11-22_132321.png "Idiot spammers")](https://niklasblog.com/?attachment_id=8859)

They may fool **Yahoo! Mail**, but very few else.

Does _anybody_ fall for e-mail like that any longer? I know, the spammers send e-mail everywhere and eventually a few do click the links I guess, but why not at least use a semi-decent sender's address, a subject line that isn't seemingly created by a monkey on a typewriter or content that could lure even more to go click? Not that I'm asking for more spam, I just wonder if how the creators think.

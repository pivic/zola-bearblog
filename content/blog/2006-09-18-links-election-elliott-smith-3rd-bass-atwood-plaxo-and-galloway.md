[![Electioneering](http://static.flickr.com/79/246689003_c0d884208b_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=246689003) Choose! The Swedish election has just passed, and the result is - the rich get richer.

I just laughed at [this video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5243836417224631021) displaying some moron trying to sell a worthless katana on some kind of home-shopping-channel, but truly gets what he deserves. I guess that was katana-karma. Much like what [Karl Lagerfeld will one day get](http://galleryoftheabsurd.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/lagerfeldlo_8.jpg) in his face.

To change things to the better, [these demos](http://www.elliottsmithbsides.com/BasementDemos.htm), supposedly left behind Elliott Smith, are quite interesting.

On another sunny musical note, [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4IQlsm7Ds)'s the video for 3rd Bass' "Gas Face", a brilliant track from a good band! Really underestimated.

It seems Margaret Atwood has followed up "[Oryx and Crake](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0375432124%26tag=niklasblog-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0375432124%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")" with a new book, "[Moral Disorder](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0747581622%26tag=niklasblog-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0747581622%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")". Mind you, the books have little in common. More about the new one [here](http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/generalfiction/0,,1874066,00.html).

I've just hooked up with [Plaxo](http://plaxo.com) again, after a hiatus when [they were evil](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/22/plaxo-now-with-less-evil). Only downfall is that my peeps have humor and love to print that in thieir contact details. I've had titles ranging from "phone witch" to "mister master" to "Royal Whore" written. Well, what can ya say? I rather humour than deadly serious.

Oh love [Galloway](http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/august2006/080806galloway.htm).

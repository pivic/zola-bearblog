This year, I must say, xmas shopping has been quite the easy ride.


Don't get me wrong, I'm still not religious, but still shouting from here. My soap-box of my netherworld.

Still, as people sigh noisier than they would if they'd be alone, as some of those leave my queue and I ponder, little words are sometimes so potent. All in the eye of the beholder and all that.

A person fairly recently dubbed me "friend" in an e-mail because what I'd written in a blog post supposedly diminuated sales. That was a weird story. Still is. Didn't hear a thing when I wrote rosy words during the same post, ditto before that.

All in the eye.

Speaking of which I'm having my hair shorn tonight. X and I'll after that be up waiting for xmas eve together, which I'm really looking forward to. Mulled wine and spending time with X's all I'm dreaming of. Scratch the wine, that's just a plus.

_Call me boring, it's just 'cause I like you_

Having my mobile T9 the word "you" with "youtube" seems lost to me. I'm a child of my time.

Anyway, off I go. I hope I know you, even if I don't have the pleasure of doing so, may I wish you a great time forthcoming the remainder of the year, and remember: it's not about celebrating national holidays like a competition. It's about celebrating everything worth celebrating, all the time. Or as the town crier known collectively as Scooter said: it's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice.

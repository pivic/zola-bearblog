From the official description:

> An urgent and powerful exploration of the rapid militarization of the police in the United States. Starting on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, as the community grapples with the death of Michael Brown, DO NOT RESIST \[...\] offers a stunning look at the current state of policing in America and a glimpse into the future. \[...\] puts viewers in the center of the action – from a ride-along with a South Carolina SWAT team and inside a police training seminar that teaches the importance of “righteous violence” to the floor of a congressional hearing on the proliferation of military equipment in small-town police departments – before exploring where controversial new technologies, including predictive policing algorithms, could lead the field next.

I will see this documentary when it hits.

The trailer - found below in this post - is beautiful, making me hang suspended, almost like I was waiting for shock but received little of what usually is expected from documentaries on authority and/or fascistic structures.

This reminds me of reading "_[Irregular Army: How the US Military Recruited Neo-Nazis, Gang Members, and Criminals to Fight the War on Terror](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13490153-irregular-army)_" by Matt Kennard, where the levels of acceptance to become part of the state-employed military becomes easier and easier, lowering demands for anybody willing to join; similarly, this happens in the police. Sweden - where I live - [is no exception](https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&artikel=6472373).

The documentary also reminds me of Jill Leovy's absolutely brilliant "_[Ghettoside: A Story of Murder in America](https://niklasblog.com/?p=17359)_", where American police are examined into modern-day society. This book is both vital and one of the best non-fiction books that I have read in the past years.

From [Ryan Devereaux of The Intercept on this film](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/12/do-not-resist-the-police-militarization-documentary-everyone-should-see/):

> Based on substantial on-the-ground reporting, “Do Not Resist” is both unsettling to watch and necessary to see. The film begins in Ferguson, Missouri, on a rainy night of protest in August 2014 that erupted into a melee of tear gas and screaming. It then quickly moves to a seminar with Dave Grossman, a law enforcement guru who gives trainings on lethal force and the application of a warrior mentality in the name of the law.
> 
> “The policeman is the man of the city,” Grossman begins, before explaining that cops he’s spoken to routinely describe their first on-the-job kill as a prelude to the best sex of their lives. “Both partners are very invested in some very intense sex,” Grossman says. “There’s not a whole lot of perks that come with this job. You find one, relax and enjoy it.”
> 
> Grossman believes that a violent reckoning between law enforcement and critics of police militarization is fast approaching. “We are at war,” Grossman tells the crowd, “and you are the front-line troops in this war.”
> 
> The language reflects a theme that runs throughout “Do Not Resist.”

Here's the first official trailer:

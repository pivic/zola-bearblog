While driving I've found that very few people actually use their directional indicators. Nothing like sheer terror to wake you up in the morning!

I'm sitting at Blooms on Hornsgatan, which is located in the south of Stockholm city. The coffee is sub-par ((Mostly due to two things: 1. being poorly made with re-heated milk and 2. the barista put a finger in the coffee and I didn't complain about it, stupidly.)) and I'm waiting to have a slice of ready-made vegetarian lasagne, sitting among mountains of trash that's just waiting to be cleaned off the tables.

It's weird to have subscribed to [Twitter MacWorld](http://twitter.com/macworld) ((Check out [what Twitter is about](http://twitter.com/faq) if you haven't already, otherwise you might as well skip the rest of this paragraph.)) for the past two days. People have been updating the channel with the most uninteresting stuff. As somebody has written, at times, Twitter is the "Seinfeld" of the Internet: a place where updates are mostly not very interesting. On the other hand, one chooses which to listen to, which is the brilliant thing about Twitter. And, what the hell, I cannot say my updates are interesting to anybody other than myself, which is good; Twitter is about egoism. One writes about what one is doing at the moment, and others choose whether or not to partake of this information. Personally, I'm surprised that not many Swedes aren't into this, especially as it's free, but I think most people need to be kicked in the rear about these things to start using them - either that, or somebody they look up to/admire use it. I even dare say that the Blackberry merely boomed when everybody and their dog found out that the contents of Paris Hilton's Blackberry was hacked and placed everywhere on the Internet. Nothing like having Eminem's former mobile phone-number to get you Blackberrying, is there?

Oh, Blooms missed my order. This goes well hand-in-hand with their utterly unprofessional service and approach. Too bad that they are in cahoots with The Red Cross in this location; the latter are certainly not benefitting from this relationship.

It's time to get out of here. Blooms is making me sick.

Yes, I'd very much like an [Apple iPhone](http://apple.com/iphone). Check [this video](http://news.com.com/1606-2-6148749.html) of Steve Jobs showing off the features at the MacWorld Expo, yesterday.

I like working in Excel 2007 a lot more than in previous versions. Just the new multiple-choice filtering menu is very nice.

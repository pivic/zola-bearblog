[![The Unwritten, Vol. 6: Tommy Taylor and the War of Words](http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1331516010m/13495085.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13495085)[The Unwritten, Vol. 6: Tommy Taylor and the War of Words](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13495085) by [Mike Carey](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9018)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/428024447)  
  
This is a lot better than volume 5, which to me was more of a fevered sprawl of a collection rather than this, a focused epic tell that leaves behind a trail of the unknown and a waft of promise of what might turn into a more complicated turn of plot.

Tommy goes further into the maze that is the cabal, while trusting his companions; the enemy gains ground also, and a Mesopotamian fable is unfurled.

All in a day of the life of, you might say. The seasoned reader knows what to make of this.

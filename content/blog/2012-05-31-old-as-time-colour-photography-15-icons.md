I find it wonderful that I reacted to [these photographs](http://blogs.denverpost.com/captured/2009/10/21/color-photography-from-russian-in-the-early-1900s/544/) being more than a hundred years old _and_ **in colour**. I mean, so far I've only thought of colour photography to exist from the 1920s - which is wrong; [it's existed from 1855](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_photography).

So, colour photography is old. Really old. Two generations old.

It feels strange to me.

About as strange as [these 15 different icons that young people don't really get](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheFloppyDiskMeansSaveAnd14OtherOldPeopleIconsThatDontMakeSenseAnymore.aspx), e.g. the floppy disc for **Save** and manila folders for **Folders**.

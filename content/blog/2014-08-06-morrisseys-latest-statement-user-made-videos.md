Below are the three home-made videos that **Morrissey** mentions in [his latest statement](http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_140805_01) in True To You:

He writes, among other things (I added the links):

> I am indebted to three sources that have placed their own well-crafted videos on You Tube for the song World peace is none of your business. The three individual sources are named as [Sharon Jheeta](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKjwnobhR3mSD2Uy1FstkGg), [Héctor González](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2oQAnKjq6XmhG-DhFKHHJg) and [wpeace123456](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChXmE6PeDomZFAwd_d_-f-g). These videos fully understand the intent of the song, and I am relieved that these films exist. Yes, a similar document ought to have been harvested by the record label, but please understand that the pop or rock industry can be as dedicated to perpetuating public deception as the world of politics itself. God bless social media!

Please read the statement. It's powerful and empowering.

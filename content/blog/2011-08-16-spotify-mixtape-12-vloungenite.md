Yeah, it's [here](http://open.spotify.com/user/pivic/playlist/5GC2D0gnpDEhRoZlX6qsFH) and it's been a while since the last time! And you'll find my archive of previous playlists [here](http://spotify.pivic.com).

No introductions this time around. All I can say is that there's a swamp-delta theme interspersed with calm tracks influenced from my recent trip to Way Out West.

Destroyer's the shit. As is ESG with their weird funk-trip. You may not miss out on Is Tropical which is criminally neglected poppy electronics. Cher covering Dr. John is a must just as much as Plastiscines' "_Loser_" is, as it was placed in the wonderful film "[Summer Hours](http://www.criterion.com/films/473-summer-hours)", by Olivier Assayas.

**Trainspotter's note of the day**: Sylvia, as in "_Love Is Strange_", is the [Sylvia Robinson n√©e Vanderpool](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sylvia_Robinson), who created [Sugar Hill Records](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sugar_Hill_Records_%28rap%29) that put out the first hip-hop singles.

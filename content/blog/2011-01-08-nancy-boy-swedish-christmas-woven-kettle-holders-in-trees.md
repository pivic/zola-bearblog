As Winter is winding down through changes in temperature (today's the first day in ages when temperatures are bordering on nil degrees Celsius) ((I.e. 32 degrees Fahrenheit)). As I was walking my regular lunch route around a nearby lake, I found a bunch of woven kettle-holders (In Swedish: "grytlappar") hanging from trees. I had to snap and film this. First, a pic.

Then, the film. The vandals do vary their shit nowadays. I rather liked this.

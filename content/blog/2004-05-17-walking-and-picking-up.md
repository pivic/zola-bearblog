During lunch, I walked for 45 minutes straight. First, I went to drop off a pillow case that Mikaela had received as a present (with the receipt). As it didn't go together with any of our stuff, I traded it for a voucher. Right outside the store, I bumped into Andreas Flodin, an old school-mate who has recently moved from his girlfriend. He looked fine. I proceeded to Skivfönstret, to pick up the new Morrissey album together with the single, which I there and then found out was CD2 of a 2-CD-set. Boring. Nobody sold the first CD, so I have to find that one tomorrow. Additionally, Moz's on the cover of [Mojo](http://www.mojo4music.com), this month. I then proceeded to [Pet Sounds](http://www.petsounds.se), the oldest record shoppe on the south side of Stockholm. Of course, they didn't have the CD either, so I ventured to [Söderhallarna](http://www.soderhallarna.com), a shopping-center, where I went to [Il Piatto](http://www.ilpiatto.se), ordered a big tuna sandwich and headed to the office. All in all, walking for 45 minutes did me good.

Mikaela made a delicious dinner tonight, made of oven-baked chicken filets, cous-cous and a sauce containing lots of garlic. I had sweet white wine with it. [Here are some pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-05-17) from Mikaela's patented wonder-making process. By the way, the bread shown in the first picture, is from [Rivalbageriet](http://www.rival.se/undersidor/mat-dryck_cafe-rival.htm) and is titelled "Lenin", as it's a Russian-bred bread, sour and...filly.

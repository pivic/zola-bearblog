[Ash](http://www.ash-official.com) have split with [Charlotte Hatherley](http://www.charlottehatherley.com), relocated from London to New York and have just released their last album, "Twilight Of The Innocents". No, they're not splitting up, just killing the album (("\[...\] we released a press statement that we're gonna give up on making albums, but we're gonna make music and release it as it's done. So a lot more constant with the releases -- and then probably compile them later on CDs. We just feel the iPod has changed how people listen to music and it seems like a good idea to try new ideas." courtesy of [Herald Sun](http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22016974-5006024,00.html))) as we know it.

The new album isn't as set on hooks and sounds like the most mature Ash to date. Little wonder. These pesky kids who made "[1977](http://www.amazon.co.uk/1977-Ash/dp/B0000274GW)", one of my absolute favourite power-pop albums, are now 30 years old. Ha!

Here's what I think is one of the best tracks on the new album. The track is called "Ritual" and even though Tim Wheeler isn't the most brilliant lyricist and is a wee bit strung-out on sci-fi and fantasy it's more than OK. And the melodies and atmosphere! _The more reverb you use, the more atmosphere you get._ ((Not a quote by Ash, but by Depeche Mode - Martin Gore, I think!)) This track seems to get me off my lethargic state as I've just started working again after a beautiful three week-long vacation. As usual, the track will be but a memory in a week, unless you buy the album which you should, of course. Buy three copies! I know people who do this on a regular basis!

Furthermore, here's the video for the latest single off the new album, called "Polaris" ((If you're looking for videos of Ash, check out [their YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/ashofficial).)):

Link tip: since Jed Shepard's wonderful [Ash Unofficial](http://web.archive.org/web/20010101-20050101re_/http://ash-unofficial.com) site closed down a couple of years ago (hey, he ran [a story](http://web.archive.org/web/20010101000000-20050101235959/http://ash-unofficial.com/niklas.htm) about my pimped cover of "Kung Fu" which killed my ADSL connection, what else could it be but shut down - OK, I'll give you [insane](http://web.archive.org/web/20010101000000-20050101235959/http://ash-unofficial.com/catash.htm) as well) it's been replaced with [Walking Barefoot](http://walking-barefoot.com), a good and clean-cut (albeit not as humorous as the old one) fansite all about Ash.

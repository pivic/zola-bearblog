I just found this video when cleaning house..

It's an old-as-fuck karaoke thing from a place in Stockholm named **King's Cross**. I'm drunk and forget words, but obviously I had fun like fuck. I'm kind of glad for two things:

1. That mobile tech was so lo-fi when this was made
2. The karaoke host helped out in the chorus

Don't ask where all the falsetto came from.

By the way, this was during try-outs for the Swedish Karaoke Championships. I had no idea. I was just there with mates getting drunk, having fun. Some people threw some acid looks at me as they wore drip just like they were envious of Rod Carew.

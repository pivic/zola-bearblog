On sale today, I got hold of a photo-cum-writing book called "[Right: Portraits from the Evangelical Ivy League](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811865339?tag=niklasblog-20)", mostly by [Jona Frank](http://www.jonafrank.com).

From [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=6IuwPQAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0811865339):

> Patrick Henry College is the higher education institution of choice among politically far-right young people aspiring to enter the conservative power elite. The explicit mission of PHC is to cultivate leaders to take American politics and culture back to God, through careers in politics and entertainment. Acclaimed photographer Jona Frank presents an honest, intimate, and eye-opening portrait of the school and its students. Frank's photos eschew cultural politicking of the left or the right, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions about a school and a youth movement with the potential to produce many of tomorrow's leaders.

OK. The people in this book are home-schooled and after high-school, they go here, to the "christian equivalent of the Ivy League", according to its founder, [Michael Farris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael%20Farris). He founded this college because he thought "public schools, with their sex-ed classes and gay student clubs were '[Godless monstrosities](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/18/education/godless-monstrosity-in-political-debate.html)'".

Wow. This is one tough bite.

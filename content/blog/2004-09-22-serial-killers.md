I've always been fascinated by serial killers. I think most people are, at some point, but when I was 12 years old I was so intrigued by the murders committed by Jack The Ripper that I had monthly mail-discussions with 50-year-old Englishmen on the matter. Now I've just ordered Michael Newton's "[Century Of Slaughter](http://www.michaelnewton.homestead.com/CenturyofSlaughter.html)", a book which (despite the awful title) has been applauded throughout the academic world. I found out about this one when browsing the FBI files on the "[Silence Of The Lambs](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=13)" DVD courtesy of Criterion. I also saw [this page](http://www.fortunecity.com/roswell/streiber/273/azofkillers.htm), listing a lot of known and unknown serial killers. It's so interesting!

It doesn't lead to anything useful? Hell, at least _I_ know what I'll do if my future kids start torturing their pets and setting the house on fire. If they don't kill me first, of course.

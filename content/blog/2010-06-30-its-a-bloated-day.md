I'm staying at home today because of an allergy shock; last night my breathing apparatus nearly caved in (slight overstatement), my eyes teared incessantly (near-truth) and I nearly died (embarrassing lie). Today, due to sufficient medications, I'm fine. I just don't know why I reacted like I did, but I bet it's to do with summer finally arriving to Stockholm and something blooming.

Today X and I cleaned the apartment windows for the first time. Ever. Since arriving here, which amounts to 2,5 years. Stats:

**2**: number of dead animals found trapped between windows **2**: number of times I hurt myself from washing windows with a soft cloth **979472**: number of times I felt like Daniel-San ((Although, it must be said, X is no Mr. Miyagi.))

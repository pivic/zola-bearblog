First, I'm quite appalled to find [a remake of "The Pink Panther" being done](http://chud.com/news/907), featuring Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and some other formerly funny people (with Beyonc√© Knowles thrown in). There's a trailer available by clicking a link at that site, but I'm not going to do it.

A shot-by-shot recreation of Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video has been made, using only LEGO in it. Check the video (WMV) out [here](http://www.koreus.com/files/200408/lego_thriller.html).

Dubya's going through the "toughest security precautions ever" during his coming inaguration on 2005-01-20. Does it mean he will ride a popemobile? Will he be disguised as Condoleezza? Check out the article and funny pictures [here](http://www.qctimes.com/internal.php?story_id=1041851&l=1&t=Nation+%2F+World&c=26,1041851).

[Here](http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com)'s a site entirely dedicated to tea and biscuits. Yes, English people run it. Yes, they offer paraphernalia available for purchase.

Another sign that people are willing to sign anything \[courtesy of [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net)\], right [here](http://www.salguod.com/blog/archives/2004/12/people_will_sig.html). I love it! Reminds me of a relation who found different names for the plastic bags bought at Systembolaget, which is the state-owned booze-selling monopoly organisation. "Plastic bag" is the usual term. Other times it would read stuff like "Pop-Linda's bag" or "winebag".

To end this, [don't forget to check for Jesus Christ in your dental records](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=6138180045).

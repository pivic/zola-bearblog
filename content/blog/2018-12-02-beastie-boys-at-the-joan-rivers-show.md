From [Rolling Stone Magazine](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/flashback-the-beastie-boys-meet-joan-rivers-73786/):

> The Beastie Boys performed “(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)” in full knucklehead mode, jumping around, posing, pushing each other down, rolling around, even doing a handstand. Onstage with them was DJ Hurricane and a go-go dancer named Eloise, gyrating in a bra and fishnets. But even though the performance is chaotic and sloppy, it’s also exhilarating: prime early Beasties.

> Twelve years later, Adam Yauch (aka MCA) reflected on the band’s meathead image in this era, which he said was originally intended as parody: “By drinking so much beer and acting like sexist macho jerks we actually became just that,” he wrote in the liner notes to _The Sounds of Science_. “So I guess that the story could have a couple of possible morals. One might be, ‘Be careful of what you make fun or you might become it.’ But the other one, the one that I like is, ‘All of the sexist macho jerks in the world are just pretending cause they’re caught in a rut, and maybe, at some point in the future, when the planets line up in a certain way, they’ll all just snap out of it.'”

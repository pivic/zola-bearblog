When X, Malin and I arrived, the place was pretty empty. We heard Me and My Army as we entered the area, which looked nice.

Malin loved her coffe. Or coffee.

The duck had jumped into the pool as opposed to sitting on top of the bleachers like last time.

Henrik Berggren! He played a lot of Broder Daniel-tracks - all of them, I think - in the same style, which eventually bored the pants off me. Some tracks were magic to hear again, though, e.g. "_Shoreline_" and "_Happy People Never Fantasize_".

Yes, Converse ruled Popaganda as they did at Way Out West. Must be a Swedish classic now, as Jens Lekman would put it...

I saw only one person jump into a pool.

X awaiting Arcade Fire. Or maybe some cider.

Arcade Fire. Everybody was there, and man in a plaid shirt danced his heart out. It was so lovely to see.

[![Different meats](http://static.flickr.com/46/110682025_6b96c09b2c_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=110682025) Yesterday evening, [John](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/110682057) and [Frederic](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=110682172) came over and had dinner with us. A very nice time was had by all, with a lot of cooking and laughing. Pictures from this occation will be spread throughout this post. Mikaela had made a very lovely salad with beet-roots and feta-cheese, I had compiled a number of meats, cheeses and breads, Frederic had brought bread and John made shiratamako, a Japanese dessert which contains sweet rice and stuffs I couldn't even imagine existed. Lovely.

[![Japanese dessert - shiratamako](http://static.flickr.com/42/110682318_b8e951e81d_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=110682318) I've been getting into [Skype](http://skype.com). Instead of paying a lot of money every time I telephone friends abroad, I paid 115SKR (appx. 14USD) for 100SKR's worth (15SKR in taxes), spoke with a friend for 4 minutes, and paid 0,5SKR for it; I actually called her mobile phone, so this means I could waste my 100SKR by speaking with her for 80 minutes using Skype - while she's using her _mobile phone_. That's a mighty good price, that is. If you just want to use Skype to call your mates who also have Skype installed, it's free. I paid that sum to be able to call people who don't use Skype. More about that [here](http://www.skype.com/products/skypeout).

I just found [mobilicio.us](http://mobilicio.us/www/index.php), a service for those who use [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us), a [social bookmarking](http://www.answers.com/social+bookmarking) service. Mobilicio.us lets you use a mobile phone (which supports web-surfing) to see your del.icio.us-bookmarks.

[![Beet-root salad](http://static.flickr.com/39/110681900_3cd7fba9f6_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=110681900) Quite similar is [flagr](http://flagr.com), also new and used to bookmark, but just for physical places. Using Google Maps as the base, you can mark places and write comments. E.g. "Starbucks in my town equals the devil, please use Delocator: http://delocator.net/index.php". The problem for us non-US-citizens is this: the Google Maps-service only really supports the USA. Us others have to use our navigational skills and Google Maps to point out exactly where our sts are. Nice try, but if it doesn't include the rest of the world, I'll find it unusable.

Speaking of tech, I'm looking forward to [this attempt](http://www.brokenkode.com/archives/shuttle-wave-one) to make the admin-interface in [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) better-looking and more useable.

Speaking of that, I'm hereby applauding the Microsoft Office-team for having made Office 2007 even prettier, which is displayed in this blog-post. [The changes as displayed here](http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/03/09/547281.aspx) are already available for beta-testers, due to an interim fix between beta 1 and beta 2, which is due within a month.

[I've written about it previously](https://niklasblog.com/?p=892), and [here](http://www.listsofbests.com/list/387)'s a little list I've compiled.

Oh, [Blixa Bargeld is coming to Sweden in April](http://www.luger.se/_bokaband_visa2.asp?PK_Id=523)! His "[Rede/Speech](http://www.blixa-bargeld.com/blixa-bargeld-en-projects-01.html)"-project is due again.

Frederic just sent me [this link](http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=3635) to a great post on how a man poses as a girl and plays [World of Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com), an online game. Great thought-provoking humor is never wrong. My fave line: "u didnt say ur retarded".

Alright, I have to confess to not having been a [BSB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys "Backstreet Boys") fan before, but suddenly, I kinda am. I've heard tracks like "_[As Long As You Love Me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Long_as_You_Love_Me "As Long as You Love Me")_" and "_[Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_Me_the_Meaning_of_Being_Lonely "Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely")_" that were really cool, but thanks to the RedOne-produced "_Straight Through My Heart_" and old ones that I've newly discovered, e.g. "_[Shape of My Heart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_My_Heart "Shape of My Heart")_" and "_Incomplete_" I've come to find that BSB blow other traditional [boy-bands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band "Boy band") off the charts, especially if you're a sucker for great pop.

Which they do deliver. My word.

I went to the gig with X and Malin, and we were psyched; they are old-school fans and I was glad that they put up with my mauling of lyrics and incredulous dancing, but apart from that, what about the gig?

They kicked off with "_Everybody (Backstreet's Back)_" and that was big just by itself. Since delving into BSB I've come to find how much their music is based on [new jack swing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_jack_swing "New jack swing") and I love it; also, there's a great element of [Cheiron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheiron%20Studios)\-produced pop.

The choreography is a bit toned down nowadays. Understandable. I mean, the members aren't 16 years old any more; more like in their 30s which means they did a more tap-your-feet-gently routine than flying trapeze-somersaults. ((Sure, [their dances and singing on Jimmy Kimmel Live](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Incs6VkWxY) is NOT recommendable in any respect...)) Despite this, their vocal abilities are still apt and fresh; I love some of the new tracks, and even "_Bigger_" felt like it belonged in an arena. The main exception being "_PDA_", which I still consider to be some kind of crude joke, ever since my girlfriend turned me on to the lyrics...

Even though we had nosebleed tickets I loved the gig. The boys performed, and despite the bad videos that were broadcast during the band's to-and-fro demises from stage, most of the tracks were like a trip through memory lane. Some of the songs are evergreens. Also, it was nice to hear some tracks that weren't expected, i.e. listed on the Facebook event through previous gigs on this tour, e.g. "_Incomplete_".

Am I going to see them the next time they show up? Damn straight I will.

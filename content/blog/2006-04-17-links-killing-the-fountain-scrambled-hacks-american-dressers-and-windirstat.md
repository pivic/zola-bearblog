[A murderer wrote about his cannibalistic fantasies on his blog](http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/04/16/underwood.ap/index.html), but unlike 99,99999% blogging goths, he actually killed somebody with the intent of eating that person's flesh. Two snippets from the article:

> Underwood \[...\] was a "boring" man who rarely smiled.
> 
> "Just his tone of voice, he just sounded dull," Verdan said. "Trying to get a smile out of him took an act of Congress."
> 
> \[...\]
> 
> "Regarding a potential motive," Purcell Police Chief David Tompkins said Saturday, "this appears to have been part of a plan to kidnap a person, rape them, torture them, kill them, cut off their head, drain the body of blood, rape the corpse, eat the corpse then dispose of the organs and bones."

Now that Darren Aronofsky's "[The Fountain](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414993)" is [finally trailing onto the Internet](http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/thefountain), I'm happy to see it becoming reality - even though I would have preferred the first candidate, Brad Pitt, to the one selected, who is Hugh Jackman. I was not aware that Aronofsky had ordered [the story to become a graphic novel](http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=4287) (according to Vertigo Comics), [available now](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=niklasblog-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1401200591)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1). Very interesting!

Speaking of films, I really wonder if Larry Clark's coming film, "[Wassup Rockers](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10005963-wassup_rockers)", will be of interest when it hits this summer. Strangely, I'm more looking forward to "[Kung Fu Panda](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773)".

I just read [this article from Wired Magazine](http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,70664-0.html) and was stunned. [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlhKaxcKpA) stunned me even more, of course, in case you miss it through said article. A brief synopsis on what Scrambled Hacks is about:

> \[The video\] depicts a man demonstrating software that appears to parse what he's saying fast enough to reassemble the same words by pulling and reordering bits from a recorded Michael Jackson interview. The result: Jackson appears to speak the same sentence right back to him.
> 
> The man goes on to explain how the software behind this process works, and his video closes with a live performance of the software in which a performer appears to employ the beat-box method to control the playback of audio and video on a large video screen behind him, in front of what I can only imagine must be a dazzled crowd.

[Here](http://manolomen.com/2006/04/17/the-ugly-american)'s an interesting article on Americans dressing badly when going abroad. From it, courtesy of [Manolo for the Men](http://manolomen.com):

> The [Daily Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/04/16/wtour16.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/04/16/ixworld.html) is reporting that the U.S. State Department is teaming up with private business to improve the boorish behavior of American tourists abroad. \[...\] Not only does the American mania for casual dress come across as rude in countries where people still care about propriety, but dressing better can actually prevent loutishness.

[WinDirStat](http://windirstat.sourceforge.net) looks like a worthy opponent of [SequoiaView](http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview). The WinStat homepage reports that the installer is a beta-version, but it should work for most of us (who aren't running Win95). Will try later, as I use SequoiaView staggeringly often to find out which files on my hard-disks are huge.

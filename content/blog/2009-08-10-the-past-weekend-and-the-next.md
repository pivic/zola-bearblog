She lost her boyfriend and so it came to be that X and I picked her up late on Friday evening. The weekend was spent with her, consoling and doing other things together. We went to Tantogården, where we saw people falling from a high:

The past weekend wasn't spent doing much more than talking and catching a few rays.

The next weekend, though, X and I are going to hear (!) the world premiere of Sparks' "_The Seduction of [Ingmar Bergman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000005 "Ingmar Bergman")_", a radio performance, live at [Södra Teatern](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=59.3183333333,18.0741666667&spn=0.01,0.01&q=59.3183333333,18.0741666667%20%28S%C3%B6dra%20Teatern%29&t=h "Södra Teatern"), with a bit of watching thrown in for measure. The Mael brothers will be there, but I'm not quite sure about what's going to happen... That's instead of the [Way Out West](http://wayoutwest.se) music festival, which has completely tanked as they've been intent on scheduling nearly all the best artists to play on Friday instead of spreading it out. No way! So there.

And come Sunday we're going to hang out with my parents at Norsborgs Park, and preferably get a shelf drilled up onto a wall - and then come up with a clever way to make the cats not try and use it for their enjoyment. Working with cats can some times be like trying to act a general during war, constantly trying to come up with clever ideas to divert the enemy, which in our case is our beloved kitties. Go figure.

As I'm writing this, X's roaming Stockholm city with her mother, having a lovely time. I'm at work. I feel like a child, saying Not fair! to everybody but that's the way things are, and I'm instead looking forward to what I hope will be a calm, lovely evening.

_I'm losing my edge. I was there..._

Lo, this is written using a mobile phone. At a café. I'm writing lyrics for music yet to be written, while listening to my iPod that's shuffling everything in its little library. Little. A lot of them are easy to play on guitar. Others are impossible.

Lyrics are hard to write some times, but when I check my notebook, the one that contains all my lyrics, I find the first ones embarrassing and the later ones OK. I'm actually quite satisfied with the new ones. Now all that remains is music and then tweaking for it all to come together.

I've just recorded some video at the café and streamed it live. Somebody from Norway commented, but I couldn't comment back. The Internet is such a wonderful place.

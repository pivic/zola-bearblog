This is probably the first post in a while, that doesn't include a photo gallery. Sad, that. The reason is simple: it's too much fun. Whaa? What a go-getting attention-seeker of a line, right? Anyway, I don't mean to be rude to you, kind reader. The reason I'm not taking any more pictures with the Nikon D70 is I'm going to give it back to Frederic, who kindly lent it to me. He hasn't asked it back, but the real reason is this: if I loan it any longer, I'm going to wreck my economy by saving every single penny so I can buy a completely new Nikon D70s by next (or the next after that) salary. So, damn it. I am going to buy an expensive digital system camera, but I'll buy it safely knowing it's going to be a good buy, good buy.

After a quick and quasi-OK lunch today at Kato, a sushi place close to work, I left for [Swedisc](http://www.swedisc.com), where J-O (who runs the place) has now opened his shop again. I saw "[The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362270)", [the double-disc Criterion edition,](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=300) and knew I had to buy it. I didn't know much about the film beforehand, and I'm almost always glad for that, even though I've heard the soundtrack a dozen times. Seu Jorge plays Bowie-tracks on that one, singing them in Portugese, and apart from some great songs (a couple of Bowie originals and a Iggy & The Stooges track, for instance) Mark Mothersbaugh made the rest of the music, which is also very suitable and cool. The film was very warm, stylistic, well-done, well-played and brilliantly directed.

After work today, I went to [Needy Greedy](http://www.nittygritty.se/shop/default.aspx), which is the outlet part of Nitty Gritty, a clothes-retailer. I didn't think I'd find anything really interesting, but had my hopes high that I'd find some really f-ed up haute couture. Well, I did find stuff. I bought three shirts, a jacket and two books, and hey, suddenly I find myself utterly without any remote chance of having a D70s next month. Really, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. How can I write in a way to make you think I don't care about getting my paws on that digital camera? I'm such a materialistic beeyatch at times, I might as well rename myself [Oprah Winfrey](http://pub.tv2.no/multimedia/na/archive/00130/People_s_Choice_Awa_130038a.jpg) and go on living her life instead of mine. The lining in the jacket I bought is utterly insane. I will post pictures.

Surfing about New Order-sites, I found [Peter Saville's](http://www.btinternet.com/~comme6/saville), the man responsible for Joy Division/New Order's graphical look since day one. Visit it, and while you do, be sure to download some of the fonts he's letting go for free. All of them have graced the album covers of JD/NO throughout the decades.

Tomorrow is quasi bank-holiday, so I'm meeting [Andreas](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreasflodin) in the afternoon. That'll be nice. In the evening: meeting Frederic to watch a film and just take it easy. Good-night, London.

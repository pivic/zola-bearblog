[![Best Coast](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/artworks-000059892363-pbwdem-t500x500.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/artworks-000059892363-pbwdem-t500x500.jpg)

I loved **[Best Coast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Coast)**'s [first album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_for_You_(Best_Coast_album)), didn't care much for [their second one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Only_Place), but [the mini album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fade_Away_(Best_Coast_album)) from which this track is, is back on track, yet smelling all new. Rawk guitars with brilliant melodies, and Beth's voice is brilliant. I've a soft spot for female voices that sound a little deadpan. The lyrics are heartbreak and sadness, but paired with [the Nirvana-circa-In-Utero](https://soundcloud.com/submx-alf/nirvana-in-utero-tourettes) guitars, it's a feel of [Scout Niblett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_Niblett) mixed with [1960-1970s girl-group pop](https://soundcloud.com/umesongs/mary-wells-my-guy). It's short, hard hitting and simple, pretty pop; I love this.

Find embedded song clips at the bottom of this post.

**Oscean** - [Ideoma](https://tresorberlin.bandcamp.com/album/ideoma)

Brilliant EP from a hypnotic techno duo that hail from Argentina.

**Joni Mitchell** - [Both Sides Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Both_Sides_Now_(Joni_Mitchell_album))

This is mainly a covers album. Her voice and expression reach far beyond the audial. The song 'Both Sides, Now' is astounding, and is written by Mitchell herself.

**Jacques Greene** - [Fantasy](https://jacquesgreene.bandcamp.com/)

A mind-washing EP of ambient beauty.

**The Black Dog** - [Brutal Minimalism EP](https://duststoredigital.com/album/brutal-minimalism-ep)

Once again, the EP-busting electronics duo The Black Dog release a piece of Sheffield-based organic and deeply moving music.

**Det Eviga Leendet**

- [Lenience](https://detevigaleendet.bandcamp.com/album/lenience)
- [Reverence](https://detevigaleendet.bandcamp.com/album/reverence)

Two EPs, both showcasing grinding yet slow-moving black metal sounds from Uppsala, Sweden.

**The Beatles** - [Get Back (Rooftop Performance)](https://www.thebeatles.com/beatles-get-back-rooftop-performance-0)

Due to Peter Jackson's fairly new documentary series _Get Back_, this album is now out in remixed format and on streaming services. The album gives a lovely picture of a band that gelled.

**Mitski** - [Laurel Hell](https://mitski.bandcamp.com/album/laurel-hell)

Brilliant songwriter, new album. Pop sensibilities, very good work, even though I miss her circa _[Your Best American Girl](https://mitski.bandcamp.com/track/your-best-american-girl)_.

**µ-Ziq** - [Scurlage](https://mikeparadinas.bandcamp.com/album/scurlage)

Weird, kind of dystopic. I like it. Fragmented. Felt like it was out-of-place even in its own world.

**Tim Hecker** - [The North Water (Original Score)](https://timhecker.bandcamp.com/album/the-north-water-original-score)

Fair, not loud at all. Expressive but understated.

**Leoš Janá?ek**, Maia Brami, Camerata Zürich, Igor Karsko - [On An Overgrown Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_an_Overgrown_Path)

Very interesting piano work, written in the start of the 20th century.

**Schubert**, Wiener Philharmoniker, Carlos Kleiber – [Symphonien Nos.3&8 »Unvollendete•Unfinished•Inachevee«](https://www.discogs.com/release/4833631-Schubert-Wiener-Philharmoniker-Carlos-Kleiber-Symphonien-Nos38-UnvollendeteUnfinishedInachevee)

Not my fave cup of tea but interesting. A lot of people will know [this track](https://songwhip.com/wiener-philharmoniker/schubert-symphony-no-8-in-b-minor-d759-unfinished-i-allegro-moderato).

**Low Tape** - Low Tape

Housey EP that almost makes me feel like Orbital have accepted a a chal to create music by using a lot of reverb, an 808, and a 1980s analogue synth, all veering toward the acid-esque side of things. Still, this is not derivative but good.

**Black Country, New Road** - Ants From Up There

This post-rock outfit has now become a mxiture of Bon Iver and The Polyphonic Spree, a lot of fiddle and brass. I welcome this.

**Erland Cooper, Shards** - Egilsay

Collaborative choral work that carries the sounds of birds a long way. Reminds me of listening to the soundtrack to the TV series _Devs_.

**Frank Peter Zimmermann** - J.S: Back: Sonatas & Partitas, Vol. 1

An emotional path into some of Bach's violin work.

**Rudolf Serkin; Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Bavarian Radio Chorus, Rafael Kubelik** - Beethoven: Piano Concertos Nos. 1-5 (Live)

Live recordings from 1977. Some astounding orchestral tone and maudlin piano work in this showcase of Beethoven's more piano-centric stuff.

**[Birgit Nilsson, Wolfgang Windgassen, C.Ludwig, E.Waechter, Orchester der Bayreuther Festspiele & Karl Bo?hm](https://www.highresaudio.com/en/artist/view/a7568b87-01f9-4619-82c0-e0ed228d9f22/b-nilsson-w-windgassen-c-ludwig-e-waechter-orchester-der-bayreuther-festspiele-karl-bo-hm)** - [Wagner: Tristan und Isolde, WWV 90 - Live (Remastered)](https://www.highresaudio.com/en/album/view/mtdt7j/b-nilsson-w-windgassen-c-ludwig-e-waechter-orchester-der-bayreuther-festspiele-karl-bo-hm-wagner-tristan-und-isolde-wwv-90-live-remastered)

To me, this serves as a four-hour reminder that Wagner wasn't just an anti-semite, but someone who could write beautiful music. This also goes for _Parsifal_, of which I was recently reminded by a colleague. This is a splendid recording, and if your hardware—regarding both your audio and wallet—allow it, I urge you to do as I've done and purchase [the FLAC 96 version](https://www.highresaudio.com/en/album/view/mtdt7j/b-nilsson-w-windgassen-c-ludwig-e-waechter-orchester-der-bayreuther-festspiele-karl-bo-hm-wagner-tristan-und-isolde-wwv-90-live-remastered) via Highresaudio.

**Spoon** - Lucifer on the Sofa

Compressed rock? Yes, please, when it's nice, ilke this. I can never remember a single song by Spoon, but when I listen to them, I'm soothed by their sound.

**Jean-Michel Blais** - [aubades](https://www.highresaudio.com/en/album/view/dpr44u/jean-michel-blais-aubades)

When I heard the first part of the introductory track, I immediately felt that this isn't for me. However, fuck that. Go to track number two, 'passepied'. I immediately thought of Michael Nyman, in a good way. This is plodding music, music that brings you on a journey. It's scales and dribbling in a space between virtuosity and elegance. It's interesting. I was drawn into the production. This is a piano-focused album but it does carry weight on other parts of the production, which is very welcome. I like this album.

[**Giuseppe Patanè**](https://www.highresaudio.com/en/artist/view/4ca95eca-f3ad-4336-b255-8e744914b171/giuseppe-patan) - [Donizetti: Lucia di Lammermoor Live (Remastered)](https://www.highresaudio.com/en/album/view/9nne5k/giuseppe-patan-donizetti-lucia-di-lammermoor-live-remastered)

A splendid and beautiful recording from 1978. The two main voices, those of Peter Dvorský, and Edita Gruberova, soar far above the breathtaking orchestration, turning this into a beautiful two-hour album. Get the remastered version

**Christian Thielemann, The Philadelphia Orchestra** - Wagner: Preludes and Orchestral Music

A fair collection of music from different parts of Wagner's oeuvre; said regarding _Tristan und Isolde_, the shining example here is _Parsifal_, with its breathing sunrise of an opening. Magnificent piece, beautifully performed.

**Eiko Ishibashi** - [Drive My Car (Original soundtrack with bonus tracks)](https://eikoishibashi.bandcamp.com/album/drive-my-car-original-soundtrack-with-bonus-tracks)

This instrumental soundtrack rolls straight: piano, reverbed guitars with no other effects applied, jazzy drums… Perfect for work or gazing out a window.

**Cliff Martinez** - [KIMI (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)](https://www.prostudiomasters.com/album/page/120228)

Martinez, old collaborator of Steven Soderbergh, has crafted an orchestral soundtrack album that works on its own, recalling old-school type of Hitchcock scenarios albeit without daring jumps or stabs á la Herrmann. Sure, the old-school Martinez-type of analogue warbles turn up at times, but you can forget all about how he made [Contagion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/) sound.

**Jodie Devos, Adèle Charvet, Juliet Chauvin** - [Pergolesi: Stabat Mater](https://www.highresaudio.com/en/album/view/rembj2/jodie-devos-ade-le-charvet-mai-trise-de-radio-france-le-concert-de-la-loge-julien-chauvin-pergolesi-stabat-mater)

A 53-minute-long dive into Stabat Mater, the eighteenth-century requiem of sorts. An elegiac merge of mainly voices and string instruments turns this into a masterful exhibition of chamber music. I prefer Lezhneva/Jaroussky's version, but this is only due to how I prefer the sonic density, the production, the separations and mixing of the final album.

**Kit Downes, Petter Eldh, James Maddren** - [Vermillion](https://www.highresaudio.com/en/album/view/oucgin/kit-downes-petter-eldh-james-maddren-vermillion)

Three instruments: piano, bass, and drums. All three instruments are played expressively by impressive musicians. Together, they've created a soundscape that stretches far and wide. This is jazz, non-threatening, but not without edge and clarity. What cymbal sounds! What timbre.

**Matchess** - [Huizkol](https://matchess.bandcamp.com/album/huizkol)

An album that is reflected by its cover: dark chalk connected with liquid, mountain, grey sky. Ambient furrowing stuff.

**The Sadies** - [Precious Moments](https://thesadies.bandcamp.com/album/precious-moments)

Sadly, Dallas Good, a driving force behind this band, recently died. He was one of the people behind Neko Case's masterpiece '[Fox Confessor Brings the Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Confessor_Brings_the_Flood)'. So, Good's death made me discover The Sadies, and I'm better for it. These are country licks, well-crafted songs, played with lightning precision where it comes to the guitar. Lovely.

**Mr. Oizo & Phra** - [Voilá](https://mroizo.bandcamp.com/album/voil)

Italian rap album? More like tight French electronic love from Ed Banger.

**Gábor Lázár** - [Boundary Object](https://gaborlazar.bandcamp.com/album/boundary-object)

Planet Mu, need I say more? This is some sweeping, experimental, and hypnotic electronica that pays off. Get into the groove.

**Graham Walsh** - Pharma Bro

The only bad thing about this soundtrack is that I can't buy it in high fidelity, and I refuse to buy music from Amazon. Graham is part of Holy Fuck, one of my absolute favourite electronic bands. He's recently produced a lot of great music and created his own.

Check out tracks like '[Martin Montage](https://songwhip.com/grahamwalsh/martin-montage)' and '[Things Went Wrong](https://tidal.com/browse/track/214372995)' to realise how good this soundtrack is. Swathes of great synths, music, singing, childish playfulness, and production.

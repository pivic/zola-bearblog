Check [this link](http://www.jimgilliam.com/2005/03/oreillys_henchmen_wear_suits.php) to Jim Gilliam's site to see how the henchpeople of Bill O'Reilly, the constantly lying newscaster, attacks Jim, as he's posted a link on his blog that leads to a News Hounds link, which in turn leads to a column by Bill O'Reilly.

The problem is that a legal representative of O'Reilly now tries to say it's illegal for Jim to post a link to web page, which in turn contains a link to one of O'Reilly's columns. This is ludicrous, yet fully in line with [how O'Reilly and his administration usually behaves](http://www.jimgilliam.com/bill_oreilly/index.php). There are over 175 entries on his foul behaviour recorded [here](http://mediamatters.org/archives/search.html?topic=Bill%20O'Reilly) also, courtesy of Media Matters.

I'm sure O'Reilly et al will lose, yet this type of battle is so important just because it's considered to be an easy match. Should O'Reilly win (even though the odds are not at all in his favor), his league of demons will almost certainly beseech the internet, looking for linkers to drag to court. Imagine me being sued by them, acting all behemoth. I love the Bill Hicks-ish term "shriek with laughter", and that's exactly what I'd do - if [Noam Chomsky](http://www.chomsky.info) would be a witness on my side. Oh, this is me dreaming of great things, but just imagine O'Reilly's team of tards trying to match the intelligence of Chomsky. This almost inspires me to write a moronic query letter and send it [you-know-where](http://queryletters.blogspot.com).

**note**: the strike-throughs are made due to my error, see Jim's comment to this post for a clearer explanation.

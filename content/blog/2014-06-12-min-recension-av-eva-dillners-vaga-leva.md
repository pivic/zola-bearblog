[![VÅGA LEVA](https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1390176734m/7191515.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7191515-v-ga-leva)[VÅGA LEVA](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7191515-v-ga-leva) by [Eva Dillner](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3003851.Eva_Dillner)  
My rating: [1 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/964102163)  
  
I actually won this book as part of a Goodreads giveaway, which I am grateful for.  
  
However, the vast array of weirdness that - to me, and all of my opinions of this book are naturally subjective - envelops this book is just too much for me. I'm no stranger to experimental, other and new ways of thinking, but this should have been rewritten, edited and generally reined in much more; an editor was definitely needed.  
  
I don't hate this book. It's got some things going for it, in terms of being experimental; it's a tool for trying to better yourself and doing good things, which is naturally good and loving, but where it falls flat are, among other things, when it contains texts that have been repeated throughout the book for no apparent reason (other than bad editing being the case), no references wherever are used when quasi-scientific claims or just plain nonsense is stated as fact.  
  
The book is too experimental for its own good - I can't see somebody using it to feel better while feeling bad - and it's got some weird anti-feministic bits and a very strange references to Africans thrown in.

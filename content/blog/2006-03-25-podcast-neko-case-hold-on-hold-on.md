I don't like [The New Pornographers](http://www.thenewpornographers.com), but I do like the most recent solo-album from one of their lead-singers, [Neko Case](http://www.nekocase.com). She's churned out an album that evokes memories of [The Cowboy Junkies](http://www.cowboyjunkies.com), [Lucinda Williams](http://www.lucindawilliams.com) and the feeling you get when listening to beautiful songs recorded by a band in a wood-shack place where the audial spaces lure you into oblivion, guided by Case's enchanting voice while guitars wade pretty melodies away.

The track I have here for you now, is called "Hold On, Hold On" and is taken from her latest album, "[Fox Concessor Brings The Flood](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000EBGBIK)". It'll only be available for a week, so go get it.

It is said that downloads will be available on her site right [here](http://www.nekocase.com/downloads), in the future.

She is currently touring, so catch her when she comes to your town! She will play Stockholm, my home-town, on 2006-05-14. Tickets are available [here](http://purchase.tickets.com/buy/TicketPurchase?agency=SODRATEATERN&organ_val=21761&schedule=list&event_val=NEKO).

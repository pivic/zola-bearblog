[![Love All the People](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1173117801m/248090.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248090.Love_All_the_People)[Love All the People](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248090.Love_All_the_People) by [Bill Hicks](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/144990.Bill_Hicks)  
My rating: [5 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/71453428)  
  
What's there to say?  
  
Bill Hicks is a fallen, dark poet. Maybe _the_ dark poet, who didn't like labels on anything. And he certainly didn't like governments sticking their fingers in things, as well as christians, non-smokers, homophobes, rednecks... Endless list.  
  
And he did love the search for truth and the debunking of lies, which - as he states in the book - was once Noam Chomsky's definition of what lays the base for being an intellectual. I think Bill hit the nail straight on its head when he described himself as "Noam Chomsky with dick jokes".  
  
And he was. More than a rambler, always with an open heart - except for that bit in his life when he was a completely out-of-touch alcoholic drug-abuser - and a very open mind...but don't let me label him any more.  
  
The man was a genius, and it's too bad he didn't live for longer.  
  
This collection of routines, letters, lyrics, poems and short-stories is brilliant, should be edited once more and expanded, especially seeing how David Letterman has, during 2010, publicly apologised to Bill's mother.  
  
I bought this for Â£3 and it's one of the most wisely spent sums of money I've ever shared with the world; I just wish I'd bought ten copies more and given it to friends.

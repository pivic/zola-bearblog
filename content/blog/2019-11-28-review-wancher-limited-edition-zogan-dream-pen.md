I recently received my **[Wancher Limited Edition Zogan Dream Pen](https://www.wancherpen.com/pages/zogan)**, which I've written about [when it was first announced](https://niklasblog.com/?p=23615).

It's the _real_ dream pen.

When I received [my Wancher True Urushi Dream Pen](https://niklasblog.com/?p=23563) that sports an 18K gold nib, it felt scratchy; the tines of the nib were a bit off, frankly, and so I gently pushed them into place. Still, they felt scratchy, and are still like that.

The Zogan Dream Pen has a stainless steel, gold-plated nib. Writing with it feels like using a hot knife to cut through butter.

The nib has been seared with some exquisitely made curlicues that add to the lovely look of this pen.

Layers of mother-of-pearl have been hand-cut and inlaid into the eboniteÂ pen; the stripes on the barrel, the flowers on the cap and the cap insert are lovely to see. Unfortunately, my mobile phone and editing skills don't do the colour justice, but the shells cast off different shades of colour when looking at the Zogan from different directions.

Since this pen was announced, Wancher heard from so many customers who all wanted one, that they expanded the line. It's no longer limited and is available as both urushi and ebonite, in black or red.

The pen performs beautifully with no scratching whatsoever. It's easy in my mid-sized hand, even though I prefer a smaller pen-barrel size for writing for long periods of time, e.g. [the Platinum 3776 line](https://www.platinum-pen.co.jp/products/fountain/e_fountain_3776.html) or [the LAMY 2000](https://www.lamy.com/en/lamy-2000/#sku-1201351). I'm not a perfect pen holder, but rather a mutt where it comes to holding pens; luckily, it's easier to write for longer periods of time when one is using a fountain pen that easily slides over paper, for which the Zogan Dream Pen is perfect.

This feels like a high-quality fountain pen that will last for years. The level of quality that Wancher is getting more well-known for is staggering, and their level of service and professionalism is nearly unmatched.

Buy this pen to know what Japanese artisan-made craft is like; the nib is blissful to use, the pen itself is quite lightweight, the screw-on cap feels first-class, and the artistic flourishes are beauteous. This one is worth saving up for.

Interesting infographic regarding reading habits in 2011. From [this](http://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/328-the-year-in-books-in-review-infographic) post.

I'm glad that Tina Fey's book is very well-read (actually, the most popular post on my blog this year is this one with quotes from said book), I'm confused with Jennifer Egan's "_A Visit From The Goon Squad_" being so well received and I've still got to discover David Foster Wallace...

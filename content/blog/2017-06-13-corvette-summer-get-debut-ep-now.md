My friend Patrick - of Okkervil River fame - is part of the trio that is **[Corvette Summer](https://corvettesummersound.bandcamp.com)**.

If you feel the need (and you should) for strong, guitar-led, hook-riddled tracks that make you want to have a cold beer in the Texan summer, well, hell son, here's your shot.

[Their music](https://corvettesummersound.bandcamp.com) is actually free (!) but donations are welcome. I bought their _fun-packed_ 7-song EP and so should you. Get a feel for it by clicking the band:

This is via [**Raven Book Store**](https://www.ravenbookstore.com/); follow them to know more about how Amazon has gone from just selling books to undermining all indie book shops (and also to [build concentration camps for Trump's government](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612335/amazon-is-the-invisible-backbone-behind-ices-immigration-crackdown/)).

Amazon have sent out hundreds of copies of Margaret Atwood's _[The Testaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Testaments_(novel))_ before its release date.

A quote from the article above:

> What's more, even if Penguin Random House _did_ blacklist Amazon as a means of punishment, the publisher's book sales would be such a marginal part of Amazon's overall revenue that the gesture would be basically useless aside from the symbolism. Because of its massive size, Amazon can afford to "mix-up" shipping a book early, and thereby damaging the reputation of its bookselling competition, as well as easily withstand whatever slap on the wrist Penguin Random House comes up with. This power dynamic is grossly uneven; were Amazon to blacklist Penguin Random House for any reason, it would be a much tighter squeeze.  
>   
> When Atwood wrote _The Handmaid's Tale _back in 1985, there was of course no Amazon. But in the short decades since, Amazon has become big enough and powerful enough that they can afford self-serving shipping errors, even when they concern the biggest, most secretive book event of the year. When one company controls half the print book sales in the country, and independent booksellers [only control around 6 percent](https://thepolitic.org/betting-on-books-can-the-indie-bookstore-revival-last/), this kind of show of force might even be expected. Despite Amazon backing off early shipments after getting caught, the damage is done. After 34 years, Atwood's _The Testaments_ has been reduced to a pawn.

In late October 1939, Robert Graves wrote to Alan Hodge: “I have begun a new book, about English.” Graves and Hodge had recently completed a social history of the between-wars period called _The Long Week-End_. Now they embarked on this new project, “a handbook for writers of English Prose,” to be called _[The Reader Over Your Shoulder](https://www.sevenstories.com/books/4007-the-reader-over-your-shoulder)_.

This is a hardcore book with a morsel of tersely written humor thrown in, and adequate piss-taking of the self to make any reader realise that, yes, this is the real shit, y'all. This book makes for a great companion to [Strunk/White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style), not to mention the prose of Arthur Conan Doyle and Graham Greene - two of my favourite writers, of whom the latter gets a bashing.

The first parts of the book contain guidelines and principles on writing of English prose, with plenty of tips and _critique concrete_ enough for any interest in language and the writing of prose to sate all, I believe. The last two thirds of the book are modern examples - mind you, from when the book was written, in England, in the middle of the Second World War - of how brilliant writers succumb to bad grammar, torpid use of _doublets_, far too complex sentences, and simply using words that are too hard to understand.

Even though the book is written with a fair amount of direct and indirect racism and sexism, it's deeply meaningful, especially as one considers how much one gains per sentence in the book. In fairness, the last time I read advice this well written, I picked up what is broadly loved as _The Book_ on technical writing. Reading this one is like listening to Glenn Gould playing piano; over all, and foremost, it's technically brilliant, but deep in the mix, there's _style_.

All in all, an excellent chop of English. I give it 4/5.

To finish, remember that self-insight is the best way to understand others:

A colleague gave me a heads up on an artist called **[Pretty Lights](http://www.prettylightsmusic.com)** yesterday, as his album called "_A Color Map of The Sun_" has recently been released. Hip-hop and electronics combined. At times, it's like a hip-hopified version of Moby's "[Play](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(Moby_album))", but other times, it sounds a bit too much like loops and a cut-and-paste job more than something soulful. Mind you, [Kraftwerk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk) could make the most minimalistic sounds and still come off as groovy beyond impossible; [Skrillex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skrillex)'s legacy is also very visible here, when it comes to glissando loops using sawtooth waveforms.

At its best, great beats, at its worst, too loopy and copycat.

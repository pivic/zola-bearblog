Shoshana Zuboff, Naomi Klein, Nicole Brown.

First, if you haven't already, check out the talk between Naomi Klein, Shoshana Zuboff, and Nicole Brown:

Some of my key learnings from Zuboff:

- In the latest quarter of this year:
    - Amazon doubled their profits
    - Facebook's profits went up by 98%
    - Microsoft made more money in the cloud than elsewhere
    - Apple broke the $2 Tn limit in their market value (mainly boosting their value via their wearables and services)

Meanwhile, the USA has recorded the steepest drop in GNP, _ever_.

Zuboff mentioned that after COVID-19 struck, Google now runs 50% of all online education of children.

In February (2020), [Google were sued by New Mexico for collecting student data](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145698/google-student-privacy-lawsuit-education-schools-chromebooks-new-mexico-balderas). Mind you, a year ago [Google were fined $170 Million for violating children's privacy on YouTube](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/google-youtube-fine-ftc.html).

In other words, they don't care; they just have to pay the fine and move on. Consider the fact that they're—and not only they, e.g. [Facebook for $5 Billion](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20692524/facebook-five-billion-ftc-fine-embarrassing-joke)—[paying the EU yearly Billion-dollar fines](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18270891/google-eu-antitrust-fine-adsense-advertising), violating user privacy is the everyday for Google.

Google were now forced to sign an agreement saying they never will data-mine kids again.

What evil fuckery; this from a company that used to have '[don't be evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil)' as part of their codes of conduct (not that it mattered).

Zuboff spoke about how Amazon have partnered with IBM, Cisco, Palantir, and others…and they have thousands of contracts with department of defense in the USA, all for surveillance purposes. This was made public in July 2020.

ICE, DEA, FBI, federal bureau of prisons: Microsoft is in all of that, selling their services, including [massive surveillance via the Microsoft Advanced Patrol platform](https://theintercept.com/2020/07/14/microsoft-police-state-mass-surveillance-facial-recognition/).

That's just a little bit of that talk. I advise you highly to listen to the entire video and I've only quoted Zuboff; What Brown spoke about in terms of racism—not only mentioning [recent racistic AI made by Twitter](https://gizmodo.com/twitters-scrambling-to-figure-out-why-its-photo-preview-1845123415)—was highly interesting.

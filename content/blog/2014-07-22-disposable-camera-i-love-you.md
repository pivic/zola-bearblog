I love taking pictures by disposable camera.

There's something beautiful in not knowing exactly what you've taken a picture of until you receive the physical results in the mail. I love it. Also, I really like the fact that every picture kind of counts; I mean, you have a limited number of them and then you have to buy a new disposable camera. My wife and I often share them and often keep them for quite a few weeks before we've having them developed. And when we receive the results, they seldom include all the pics we've snapped, as some are probably damaged in some process and excluded. As happy accidents have produced some of my favourite pictures - for example, when tripping and accidentally triggering a shot or just holding a camera under a table to shoot - I love waiting to see the results. And sometimes I'm just surprised by the results as I've forgotten some pictures that I've taken; opening an envelope filled with pictures is like receiving an xmas present from yourself.

When digital cameras started selling by droves, I heard people - myself included - saying stuff like "printed photos won't last forever! They will crumble and fade away! The digital copies will remain flawless forever! Digital ruuules."

_Fuck you_, former me. Since when is _flawed_ equal to _bad_? _**Life**_ is not flawless. I don't think I'll be holding my faded photos in 50 years' time, crying and wishing I'd used a digital camera instead; and I don't think anybody who lives past me will do that either. That physical/digital debate is like bruising CD vs vinyl. Today, if I go to a gig and can opt between buying a vinyl and a CD, I'll gladly go for the vinyl, which not seldom comes with a download code that gives me access to the album digitally as well. Two-in-one, wee!

There's [an app for iOS](http://www.cnet.com/how-to/shoot-now-view-later-with-1-hour-photo-for-ios) that forces you to wait for an hour before you can see pics that you have taken, to try and generate that one-hour photo feel.

But for pictures, there's nothing that - to me - is like pinning a glossy photograph onto the fridge or putting on top of something. A printed proof of what once was, something that can enlighten your day just by glancing at it, and it's somewhere else than on a screen. I like that. And yes, my cat _may_ chew the edges off that photograph, but that's also part of the spell that keeps me bound.

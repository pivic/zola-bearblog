I remember thinking that [Neil Labute](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001438)'s version of A.S. Byatt's book "[Possession](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0679735909%26tag=niklasblog-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0679735909%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "The book.")" wasn't so bad. Well, [6.5/10 at IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0256276) isn't so bad, but Labute's latest accomplishment isn't getting roses; in fact, I cannot remember a film getting whipped this much since "[Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deuce_bigelow_european_gigolo)", but check [these stats](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wicker_man) for his new rendition of "[The Wicker Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070917)", a film first made with Christopher Lee starring. Actually, check [this article](http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1863201,00.html) from The Guardian about it, and you'll see why Warner Brothers didn't want to show it to any critics.

Speaking of film, I saw "[Slither](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439815)" the other evening, with Mikaela, and it was actually very enjoyable. It's sort of a mixture between a [Troma](http://www.troma.com)\-film and "[The Blob](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051418/)Frederic, but contains a lot of humor, many a gory scene and a palpable story-line all kept together professionally; the last bit is what actually makes the Troma-films work and not work, methinks. All in all, a film made with love and humor, much like "[Shaun Of The Dead](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748)".

Speaking of horrors, I'm waiting for David Fincher's latest film, "[Zodiac](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443706)", to get done and shown in cinemas everywhere. Despite the film being built around Robert Graysmith, and despite that his theories surrounding Zodiac (i.e. the killer who called himself so) [seem to be erroneous when pointing out his "culprit](http://www.zodiackiller.com/ZBooks.html), I'm sure Fincher will hack something out to dazzle me with - along with a few million more people. Please, somebody, force Fincher to do films about serial-killers only, and I'd vote for [Richard Ramirez](http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/ramirez/terror_1.html) to be the next target.

In the mean-while, see "[Jesus Camp](http://www.apple.com/trailers/magnolia/jesuscamp)", a documentary about evangelical christians in the USA, who think the bible should be interpreted word-by-word, despite the fact that it's a lie to begin with2000 years old; well, the bible does say one shan't interpret it any other way than word-by-word, i.e. not taking anything away or adding anything, as I've stated [in the past](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1014) - read more about it [here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jesus/evangelicals/whatitmeans.html). Anyway, this documentary focuses on children being thoroughly indoctrinated to believe every single word in the bible, and that they should be happy to give their lives for christ. Oh, well - are Americans right about being more afraid of moslems than of christians? Erhm, I wouldn't know, but the christians are scariest, especially when George W. Bush is the leader of that pack, not to mention he's an evangelical christian (or so he says, which isn't true, judging from his actions). You can actually stream an entire TV-episode about that right from [here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jesus). I'll be sure to catch "Jesus Camp" when it hits; it seems very anti-evangelicals, but I'd be mighty scared if people who want to kill me for not adhering to their faith would want my kids to talk in tongues, convulse and be willing to give up their lives for Jesus Christ at the wink of an eye.

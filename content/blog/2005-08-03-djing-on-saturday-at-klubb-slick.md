An hour ago Daniel from [Klubb Slick](http://www.klubbslick.se) confirmed that I'll be DJ'ing in the smaller bar at Klubb Slick on Saturday, together with Frederic. The Brothers Bespoke strike again!

The club is open 21-02, you'll have to pay 60:- to get in, there's no wardrobe and remember: **come early**! Frederic turned up at 22:00 last Saturday and had to wait 30 minutes to get in, so there you are.

There's a big dance-floor plus bar in the main room, and a smaller bar with sofas and brilliant atmosphere. [Deadswan](http://synth.no/user/229), a Norwegian DJ, will be playing in the main room, sharing time with Lovisa Kasström, who will play hip-hop and dreadful American nu-soul (nowadays called r 'n' b).

Frederic and I will play everything great that comes to mind, which means acid, hip-hop, opera, techno, soul, indie, rock 'n' roll, pop, synth, electro, breakbeats, et.c. Don't believe me? We're not making a single crown off this, so it's all love - turn up!

**update**: [Andreas](http://anka.dyndns.org) tried the queue last Saturday at 22:20, but at that time they'd closed the doors for the evening which means they didn't let any more people in! So once again: come early.

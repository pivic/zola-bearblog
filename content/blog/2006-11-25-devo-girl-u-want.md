[![Devo](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-11-25-devo.jpg)](http://www.clubdevo.com)Punk isn't guitars. It isn't the three-chord-fever. It's definitely not about templates and being a certain way. Punk is free thought, abandoning all shackles of doubt and the word setting you free to do whatever you want to, despite of the rigid voices telling you how you _should_ do things. Punk is about saying fuck off to crippling words and doing what you want to do as long as no-one else gets hurt.

So, [Devo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devo). They came, they were punk all the way and smacked up MTV at the same time. The first time I heard them was through their "[DEV-O Live EP](http://crapple.iwarp.com/music/devoguide.html#live)" and it was just what I needed: a quirky band that took the Talking Heads-aesthetic further - even though Devo were founded appx. five years before Talking Heads - churning out staccatos from every corner while the singer spurted words about mongoloids, girls, sci-fi, [kitch personalities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booji_Boy) and [a great wardrobe](http://www.studio-sn.com/DEVO.jpg).

This is "[Girl U Want](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/devo/girl+u+want_20039737.html)", the opening track off their album "[Freedom of Choice](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:sec1z81ajyvj)".

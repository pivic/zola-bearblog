![2007-11-19-elliottsmith.jpg](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-11-19-elliottsmith.jpg)There is no sense in not letting Elliott Smith say a bit of what I feel. There is no sense in going down when you should just hang in there and see that there aren't any distinguishable fingerprints on the gun. Hang in there, even if you don't think you should. I know what I feel, and I know I'm right about this. In time, you'll feel the gun shrinking in size. The blow. The aftermath; reasoning. Healing. Raising above what's happened. The Love, reciprocated.

No matter what happens in my life, all that matters is truth, love and friendship.

X, I love you.

This track is a live-version and is originally found on the album _From A Basement On The Hill_, his first posthumous album. It will be removed after a week.

_I used to think I was damaged bad at best, and I still sometimes do. Don't let Shiva's arms open up to you, because that's not where you're meant to be. I'm a Liberty Bell too. Yes, yes, [yes](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/blur/youre+so+great_20020999.html)._

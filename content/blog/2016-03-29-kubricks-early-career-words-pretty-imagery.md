The above is a 25-minute-long great speak by Stanley Kubrick from an interview, where he talks of his life from being a kid growing up in New York City, becoming interested in photography at an early age, blah, blah.

While the "lost tapes" have been available for a bunch of years, what makes the video interesting to me is Kubrick's starting out and how things went bad for a long time, during which he worked harder and harder and dedicated himself to making shit work. There's a bit in the interview where he talks about finding out that making a film costs $40000, but undeterred, he contacts makers of film, developers, places that rent out cameras, et cetera, and ends up with a cost of $3500, so he invests money he's saved up as a photographer, makes his short film, sells it for less than he spent making it and that way (and by asking people who made films for a living) found out that the $40000 was way much for a short film, and that the company that released it went out of business. So he went into feature films, because that's where the money was to be made.

As Jack Nicholson said about Kubrick, "Just because you're a perfectionist doesn't mean you're perfect."

It's nice to know, considering how much I love his films. Kind of gives the rest of us a break from being perfect all the time.

While Stanley Kubrick is often referred to as one of the best movie directors ever, his photography isn't as well-known. [Here](http://twistedsifter.com/2011/12/stanley-kubricks-new-york-photos-1940s)'s a gallery of some of his most sellable stuff that he photographed, mainly while working as a photographer for Look Magazine in New York City. Looking at them makes me feel as though breathing is somehow made easier. I know that sounds pretentious in the extreme, but that's how it is. He was great at making stuff that touched me.

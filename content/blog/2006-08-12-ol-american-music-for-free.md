If you're spending your weekend doing orthodox things, it might be worth your while to listen to something unorthodox, and free; [here](http://www.foldedspace.org/weblog/2006/06/in_the_good_old_summertime.html)'s an entire downloadable album titled "Nipper's Greatest Hits: 1900-1920" where people with loud voices share their time singing American songs from a hundred years ago. [Enrico Caruso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Caruso) is in there, too!

It's quite nice to have swinging in the background of a laptop. The poor speakers don't exactly diminish the quality.

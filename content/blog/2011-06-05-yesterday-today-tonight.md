I remember a conversation with Dennis last night where I (yet again) concluded that this blog has become more of a culture-vulture thing rather than the quite personal collection of thoughts it once was; I intend to change that.

Yesterday, went out with X, Dennis, Katarina, Dagny, Tobit, Björn, Emma and a couple of friends to D&K. It's so nice to know that Medborgarplatsen, which is basically a town square riddled with little bars with as many outdoor seats as the government grants them, is more than just the few places smack in the middle. So we went to a secluded hideaway place called Arken. Not many people know of it. It's not the type of place you visit for the atmosphere but only for meeting friends for a drink in a central location.

Laughs, drinks, friends. Considering that work's like trying to juggle cats in a tornado right now, I love watching "Tre Kronor" doing absolutely nothing, and meeting friends is just as dear to me.

The bartender was an old friend of a friend in high-school. I don't think he recognised me at all. Seeing him pour drinks, acting all service-minded was a real mind-bend considering his ways during school: all swagger, wearing only Fila, coming across tough, constantly swearing. Seeing him pour drinks while saying "Anything else, ma'm?" seemed like a big joke, me expecting him to break out in cursing in Turkish at any moment.

This morning was "_Tre Kronor_". Spoiler-warning! Screenshot of the day:

Jojje (standing) asks his maybe-girlfriend Alva what the hell she's laughing at, as though she's not allowed to, while he's just back from his dad's trial where he's wrongly been convicted for killing his wife. By the way, the guy playing Jojje must be the worst Swedish actor, ever. Same face to every scene! "Jojje, your dad is a murderer!" - blank face. "Jojje, your life is wonderful!" - blankness. "Jojje, aliens have landed and want you to command The Universe" - blankety blank.

Fun, fun, fun.

Tonight X and I will be at the cinema, watching "_Melancholia_". I'm stoked! If I survive Blixa's climbing on top of me:

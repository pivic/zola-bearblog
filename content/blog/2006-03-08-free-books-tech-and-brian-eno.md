While the techies are trying to trump each-other by [blogging about the riches of the coming Google Calendar](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/08/exclusive-screenshots-google-calendar) (which I, of course, didn't do just a few words ago - and I'm not into writing about tech either - and I'm not into music at all) I'll bring you something that all those geeks won't be typing into their calendars: the wonderful world of books. That's right, books. Read it and weep in two ways, as you've just synched your calendar-with-one-entry ("To blog about Google Calendar") to hell!

On a serious note -- TO HELL! -- [here](http://manybooks.net/categories)'s a really good link to a lot of downloadable books. You should care, simply because the formats one can download them in are multiple; everything from HTML to PDF and eBooks is the way of the walk, so go get. I recommend Arthur Conan Doyle's stories about, and on the cases of, Sherlock Holmes.

Speaking of literature...I found [this URL](http://www.maxkiesler.com/index.php/weblog/comments/downloadable_ajax_galleries_slideshows_and_effects) leading me to a good index on AJAX galleries. If you expect me to write about [AJAX again](http://www.answers.com/AJAX), I'll vomit. Anyway, I found a very simple AJAX gallery that's worth your time if you want to UL a very simple gallery, and/or just upgrade your gallery one album at a time, just by using FTP: Minishowcase is the game, and you can download it [here](http://www.hotscripts.com/Detailed/39922.html), as the supplier's web site doesn't work properly right now, for downloading, that is.

Today, I found the [HP Easy Printer Care software](http://tinyurl.com/psjp7). It helps you to keep your HP printers in check, and I like it - apart from one single detail: if you don't have the IP addresses for your printers handy, you'll lose track of which printer is which; mind you, we had quite a few. Another thing is that the application couldn't find any printers that belonged to our ADSL-unites, no matter if I specified the IP address for one of them (and the most number of hops) manually.

Just got this tip off [Peter](http://tesugen.com); check out Brian Eno's seminar on [this page](http://longnow.org/shop/free-downloads/seminars), available in audible and printable formats.

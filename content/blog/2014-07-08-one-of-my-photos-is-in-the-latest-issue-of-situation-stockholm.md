**[Situation Stockholm](http://www.situationsthlm.se)** is the Swedish equivalent to [The Big Issue](http://www.bigissue.com) in the UK/USA, i.e. a magazine which is filled with content and is sold by homeless persons. X bought a copy yesterday and as we leafed through it I said "That looks just like a picture I shot a long time ago". And it was.

What a weird feeling! I'm glad they used it.

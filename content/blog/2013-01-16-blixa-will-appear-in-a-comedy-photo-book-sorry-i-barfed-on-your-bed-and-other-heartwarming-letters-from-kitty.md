[![Sorry I Barfed On Your Bed](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2013-01-16_0914-2.png "Sorry I Barfed On Your Bed")](https://niklasblog.com/?attachment_id=12662)

A while ago, Jeremy Greenberg ((Comic, author, TV presenter.)) contacted me and asked if a picture of Blixa would be available for inclusion in a book he's publishing, called "_[Sorry I Barfed on Your Bed (And Other Heartwarming Letters from Kitty)](http://www.amazon.com/Sorry-Barfed-Your-Bed-Heartwarming/dp/1449427049/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1347654503&sr=8-1&keywords=sorry+i+barfed+on+your+bed)_". Hell yes! Blixa to the people!

It's out on April 2nd, 2013.

It's listed on Goodreads [here](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15825724-sorry-i-barfed-on-your-bed).

As you see, the sky was special yesterday as X and I walked from Bagarmossen to Kärrtorp. Naturally, as all of us Swedes are prone to photographing the light as soon as darkness releases its 9-months-of-the-year hold of us, everybody documented it. It was also warm enough for taking a walk outside - bliss! This is how X and I celebrated our 4 years of marriage. :)

Not so fast! We also went to Turteatern where a theatre play named "[**Begränsat Utrymme**](http://turteatern.se/begransat-utrymme)" was playing.

[![Begränsat Utrymme](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/IMG_20140312_190053-1024x467.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/IMG_20140312_190053.jpg) _The start of the show._

It's sold out and runs for a short period of time, but still, it was a powerful experience, mainly about society's view of sexuality and sexual abuse. It was very visceral. It made my stomach cramp and hurt, and it was well made altogether. I love how the actors played out the different parts of _one_ person by having three actors play the same guy. Very well acted. And a bit of beloved [Einstürzende Neubauten](http://neubauten.org)'s "_[Armenia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn14Rq8sUAg)_" played over the start of it all!

Here's a trailer for the play:

This guy was playing 90s euro hits like E-Type's "_Set The World On Fire_" in slow versions on piano, which he sang along to. X and I chimed in (just not as loud). It was lovely. We even picked up a bunch of band-related pins, covers and pics of The Libertines, Joy Division, our beloved The Smiths. And bought [Henrik Bromander](http://henrikbromander.blogspot.se)'s book "_[Allt jag rör vid försvinner](http://henrikbromander.blogspot.se/p/utgivna-bocker.html)_" and [Gudrun Schyman](http://schyman.se)'s book "_[100 brev som inte?! förändrade världen](http://www.schyman.se/?page_id=85)_". Turteatern, you're a lovely place.

Red wine. Serial killers.

Radiant.

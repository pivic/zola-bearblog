![Bill O'Reilly](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2009-04-22-billoreilly.jpg)

I never imagined seeing Bill O'Reilly saying "Do we want to turn America into Sweden?" being this much fun. From The Daily Show, broadcast yesterday, Wyatt Cenac runs around Götgatan, Drottninggatan and...somewhere in Stockholm to show us what socialists like us give up! Highlight from the first part: visiting Robyn, our biggest pop star.

**update**: both parts are now included!

> **John Stewart**: When the marginal tax rate goes from 36 to 39%, we're _becoming_ Sweden.

**part 1**:

**part 2**:

This one shows Leif Pagrotsky and Björn Ulvaeus being berated, as well as [Tvålpalatset](http://tvalpalatset.se) - my fave café - showing for a nanosecond! Woo, woo! Go socialism.

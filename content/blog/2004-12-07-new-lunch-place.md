Today, on the way to eat sushi, a couple of work-mates and I stumbled across a new lunch place. I think it's called Pappa Ray Ray. It looked good from the outside and [nice from the inside](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-12-07-bar.jpg), so we came in. They have a lot of healthy-looking (from reading the names of the dishes, people) meals and so I chose a bulgur salad with feta cheese dressing, sliced root beets, nice mangold leaves and garlic-drenched bread. Well, it wasn't all good. The first piece of grilled haloumi that came with the lunch was re-heated and the other one was fried beyond edibility. The service was not very good; you got straight answers to your questions, but nothing more, not even a "Have a nice lunch!" or something like it, which I think should be customary, especially at a place like theirs, where they can easily fake a "nice atmosphere" by putting up some signs from the 50's, old lamps, et.c. The cutlery wasn't very clean either, but the bulgur was passable. I might sound a little sour grapes here, but all-in-all it was nice. The furniture was all 70's and 50's and it didn't take long to get the food. Too bad it wasn't really good. Anyway, [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-12-07-lunch1.jpg)'s the food my work-mates ate, and [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-12-07-lunch2.jpg)'s my dish. By the way, [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-12-07-workmates.jpg) are my work-mates in question and [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-12-07-panorama.mp4)'s \[MP4, 260KB\] a panorama film of the room where we ate.

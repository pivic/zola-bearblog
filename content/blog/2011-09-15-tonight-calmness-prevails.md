As I'm going for a very calm night at home without Queen X but with Princess Blixa, I might as well just take it easy which is exactly what I need.

This is perfect. Still night. Incense. Tea. Watching "_[The Matrix](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093)_", believe it or not. Just like playing Nintendo: it's nothing you think about, you just do. And it's like letting go, just not giving a fuck about work, about responsibility.

Listening to The War Against Drugs some. To [X's latest playlist](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2011/09/15/the-feeling-i-cant-move-without-sliding). Catching up on correspondence, watching "The Matrix" some more, laugh about [how the Wachowski brothers stole Grant Morrison's "The Invisibles" for their film](http://www.fortunecity.com/tatooine/niven/142/recycleb/rb40.html), and relax. Tape "The Model Agency" and lift Blixa from off the flat-screen TV, which she incessantly tries to climb on top of. Chasing her with a water sprayer. Holding her as she's sleeping.

It's quiet here, and cold is seeping in through the window closest to me. Autumn is coming, and I think I'm inviting it. Here's to Manchester 2011.

Holy Jaysis, ["V For Vendetta", the best graphic novel ever made](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=200), is to be _[made into film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/combined)_. It's true. Nathalie Portman as The Girl? Who will play "V"? I'm full of awe and suspense. I really hope for a great film, yet I'm careful. "[Daredevil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287978)" may happen again, so to speak. It's the worst comic-turned-film that I've seen.

Also if you're Swedish, check out [this very great specially subtitled snippet of Pingu](http://www.home.no/mornmorn/erki.html), the little penguin that's usually quite nice.

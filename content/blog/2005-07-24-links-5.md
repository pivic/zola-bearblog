Jamie Oliver's going to publish a new book on 2005-10-03, called "Jamie's Italy". So that's what he made of his summer stay over there! Mikaela's first reaction: "I wanna go to Italy and write a cook-book, too!" Check Jamie's post on the book [here](http://www.jamieoliver.com/diary/2005/07/21/my_new_book.php) and more on the book in itself, [here](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0718147707).

A real-life psycho dad is on trial for having boxed his 3-year-old son into a coma; the child later died from his wounds. The allogations stem from his former girl-friend and others who corraborated her testimony, [according to this article in TBO](http://news.tbo.com/news/MGBV5C523BE.html). According to different people, the 21-year-old father didn't want his son to turn out "a sissy" and/or "gay".

Ronin Ro, author of "[Have Gun Will Travel: The Spectacular Rise and Violent Fall of Death Row Records](http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=0385491352)", has written [a biography on RUN-D.M.C.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060781955) which should be interesting. Will Ro ever stop writing extremely pretentious subtitles?

Writing on hip-hop, don't miss [this interview with DMX](http://www.allhiphop.com/features/?ID=1132), where he makes sure to point out what a waster he's become. Unless his new album suddenly, inexplicably, contains collaborations with Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, I think it's going to be just as boring as his previous stuff.

If you want the real word on the streets - of New York, anyway - check out [this blog](http://standingonthebox.blogspot.com), supposedly written by a bouncer. He's interesting, in a [film noir](http://www.flickr.com/groups/filmnoir) sense of the word.

You like The Simpsons? You like the music? Check [this](http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/downloads/music.shtml) out.

The [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) [plug-in-contest](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2005/07/23/wordpress-plugin-competition-winners) is through, and I found [Avatar Popup](http://frenchfragfactory.net/ozh/my-projects/wordpress-plugin-avatar-gravatar-popup) to be the best (even though I'm still waiting for a promised easy-to-use admin quicktag interface), apart from [Popularity Contest](http://www.alexking.org/blog/2005/05/23/popularity-contest).

I love how the media excerpts that are played during the first part of this episode include the words "hero", "mystical circumstances" and "deserter", not to mention Donald "Chickenhawk" Trump saying "deserters were shot back then" to the sounds of some audience screaming with joy or horror. And there's some Obama saying "their son Bowe - is coming home", while keeping the Guantanamo Bay concentration camp open for CIA favours. Yeay.

I've little idea why mainstream ultra-right-wing-owned TV stations - as well as Donald Trump - are the only ones quoted. The results are obvious to all.

There's a video documentary being made on [Bowe Bergdahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowe_Bergdahl), the subject of Serial, season two. It's construed by the man who wrote "[Zero Dark Thirty](http://letterboxd.com/pivic/film/zero-dark-thirty)", a film that is basically known as a serious slant of history and a CIA recruitment film as though it were gung-ho'd into existence by Michael Bay. To me, that guy making a documentary on Bowe Bergdahl's trip into the unknown would be akin to let Donald Trump re-write "[Shoah](http://letterboxd.com/film/shoah)" or ad-lib a documentary on Malcolm X.

Back to the new Serial episode: I like how Bergdahl spoke up about his issues while in the military. He's a weird whistleblower; instead of alerting people of serious issues, which, according to himself (("As a private, first class, nobody is going to listen to me.")) would not lead to anything due to his rank (or lack thereof), he chose to walk into the desert, where he was snagged by taliban who later gave him back to the USA, having kidnapped him for five years. Very "[Homeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_(TV_series))".

Near the end of the first episode, the producer of the show speaks with "the taliban" who are to give their side of the story. Interesting! I hope it gets to be more nuanced than the shock horror as provided by FOX News, CNN, NBC, et cetera at the start of this episode. I'd love for the show to carry a little diatribe. Please let it turn into nuance, at the very least.

Seems to me that this season could go any way. I mean, I'm not that big a fan of season one. I liked it, but I've heard and seen a lot of true crime and I just think it was quite well puzzled together, even though it should have been much better edited. One could easily, according to me, have scrapped 50% of the material, which felt tedious. I love "[The Jinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jinx_(miniseries))": six episodes and they're out. All that was needed. Fingers crossed that "Serial" works better this time around. I'm still enthralled to hear more from Bergdahl, as his words are the most interesting thing to me. I want to hear more about his life with the taliban peeps, and how Amurka reacted to all of that, I mean, the military.

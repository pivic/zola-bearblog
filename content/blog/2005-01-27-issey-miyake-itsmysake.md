![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-01-27-perfume.gif)Mikaela just brought the most wonderful gift home! It's a blatant copy of the Issey Miyake eau de toilette, just check [these pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-01-27) out for a comparison. IT'SMYSAKà‰. Apparently the same store carried Huge Buzz. Guess which label that tried to copy?

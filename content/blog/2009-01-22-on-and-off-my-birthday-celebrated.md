For the past days I've been taking things very easy at home, with the family, i.e. X and Lotta. In the day-time I transform into Worker, and I talk to 20 people simultaneously as I support, send e-mails, install computers, configure printers and blah-blah. It's do-able for a transient period of time but I'm beginning to feel a little squashed. I won't whine about it more than a few lines, I promise, but it's like juggling cats, asking everybody "are you sure there won't be more cats thrown into the mix, because I'm kind of busy here with all of these cats and ow, they do scratch and bite as I juggle, they're cats for the sake of all things holy" and getting "no, it's alright, you shouldn't worry" and then somebody behind you opens a cat-spurting fire-hose aimed at your skull.

When today I was driven to and fro places to work, I felt comfortably numb. Nothing could reach me. It felt good:

So having worked like a beast for a number of hours I'm not exactly keen on manual labour and have to take a break to write this. In Sweden we are entitled to rest for at least 5 minutes every hour, by the way. Not that anybody would get mad at me.

Oh, I must write about Monday, my birthday. I awoke next to X who served me breakfast in bed. My little charmer! I was wooed in the most comfortable, loving way. By Bog, she always finds ways to nestle herself further into my heart! When I got home from work we shopped for and made cannelloni together. It was magnificent, just hit the spot; our b√©chamel sauce married the tomatoe sauce wonderfully, not to mention how the fresh pasta fused with the spinach...aaaw. Wine. Love. _Love_.

It felt weird doing it, but having bought [a new effect box](http://www.line6.com/podxt) (which actually cost more than my guitar, a quite cheap Les Paul copy) to be used with my electric guitar, it feels good. As I entered the store where I bought it I saw they had actually rigged a POD_XT_ with head-phones, so I just plugged in an Epiphone Les Paul Classic and drifted away. The effects and amps are astounding, and the POD even allows downloading of new tones and plugging it into a computer to create one's own, if one doesn't care to do it directly on the POD.

I have one week of purchase on approval to decide whether or not the little box is actually worth the vast sum of money I paid for it, and this is after a massive price drop on behalf of the manufacturer. We'll see!

Quite often, American companies tend to send e-mail to one of my personal domains, pivic.com, thinking it has something remotely to do with pivec.com, which is a company that promotes cars, toiletries, what have you not.

Here's a little conversation I've had so far with Mr. Winner. I don't think he'll be updating me further, but do enjoy.

As I've been ill these past three days - despite my trying to heal myself using copious amounts of [Lagavulin whisky](http://www.scotchwhisky.com/focus/lagavulin.htm) a couple of days prior to that - I'd better catch up with my linkage, for there is a revolution to be told!

Since reading [this post](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/feature/how-to-set-up-reblog-killer-server-side-feed-reader-160825.php), courtesy of Lifehacker, I've been busy with using the second beta of v2.0 of [Reblog](http://www.reblog.org). So, what's that? It's a server-side news-aggregator, which requires that you install PHP and MySQL on a web-server in order to use it. It collects all your news, just as [Bloglines](http://bloglines.com) does, with a few major exceptions.

I've been using Bloglines for a long Internet-time, i.e. for more than a gregorian year, so why the switch to Reblog? [Here](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1769970635441545616)'s a video ((Courtesy of Matt Haughey.)) where the clear advantages of Reblog are shown. Reblog is AJAX-driven and can be controlled entirely by using the keyboard. The second beta-version contains a plugin for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), letting one regurgitate news from Reblog. It lets you channel an RSS-feed with your published, i.e. saved, items that people can leech off. Mine are available [here](http://www.niklasblog.com/refeed/out/?user=1). Bloglines hasn't exactly worked wonderfully ((For instance, it's been very slow, sometimes not updating some feeds like it should have, displayed copies of news-articles more than a few times (no fault of the RSS-feeds, mind you, as I've checked them myself) and has at times felt outdated - although I must say it's mostly served its purpose beautifully)) and as Matt Haughey has already written what I, too, feel about Reblog, I let his words speak for me:

> \[...\] I've been using Bloglines to keep up with feeds, but I noticed I was wasting an hour or two each day reading my feeds there and re-checking whenever I was bored or had downtime. ReBlog is a more efficient web-based reader that gets me through my feeds faster than Bloglines.

Brilliant. I can't wait until version 2.0 gets out of beta.

While writing on revolutionary ways to do things, [Dabble](http://dabbledb.com) might be even better than Reblog, even though these are two entirely different pieces of software. What is Dabble? From their site:

> Dabble combines the best of group spreadsheets, custom databases, and intranet web applications into a new way to manage and share your information online.

[Here](http://dabbledb.com/utr/)'s a film that explicitly shows why Dabble will simplify things for the amateur who needs to...dabble with databases. [Here](http://dabbledb.com/about)'s text and images about the system for you who can't/won't see the film. Truly amazing work, insanely simplifying, a definition of web 2.0 and I cannot wait to try it myself.

[![Björg](http://static.flickr.com/54/113690299_2a867e1db1_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=113690299) Björg, the bringer of [pralines](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=113690438), bread and blindness, came by yesterday. She has recently separated with her ex-husband, who has moved in with a man he's known for two weeks. Of course, that's not the entire story, but she's doing well by herself, and is taking her life into a new, much better direction. Kudos and all our love to Björg!

[PlayStation 3 will be released early november 2006](http://www.us.playstation.com/newsstories.aspx?id=3907) at roughly the same time as [PlayStation Network Platform for online biz](http://www.us.playstation.com/newsstories.aspx?id=3906). Great news for gamers, and while at it, Sony is going to release [a new version of the PlayStation Portable](http://www.us.playstation.com/newsstories.aspx?id=3896) where they're dropping the price and releasing two add-ons, a camera and a GPS-receiver. That's as elaborate as [this operation](http://www.phishhook.com/board/viewtopic.php?t=550448)!

[9cays](http://9cays.com) is an interesting, free web system for keeping e-mail-conversations in check. From their site:

> Sick of getting group email that you don't want?
> 
> Sick of reading through badly formatted quotes at the bottom of messages?
> 
> Sick of people claiming they never got your message?

Very interesting, especially the part about "A 9cays conversation provides an independent record of email sent and received.".

Soon [Morrissey](http://www.morrisseymusic.com) will be visiting Sweden, and on the 9th of April Swedish television will be broadcasting his performance on Bingolotto. The information is not out officially yet due to [the Bingolotto-site](http://tv4.se/bingolotto), but I have [previously](https://niklasblog.com/?p=892) posted a bit on what Bingolotto is like. For more Morrissey, read [this article](http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002198233), which amazed me: The Smiths were only offered 5 million USD to reform for a gig? I think ABBA were offered appx. 100 million USD for 5-10 gigs in Japan. Oh well, you know what _they_ say: "Your artistic worth can only be measured by how much money you're offered to stand onstage with people you dislike (or hate)."

I like [Selenium IDE](http://www.openqa.org/selenium-ide), an extension for Firefox. It's a tool mainly for testers who use [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox), but can also be used to automate tasks you usually perform. Highly interesting to learn, for people who don't have asperger's syndrome.

Making Linux easier for regular people to use: [Automatix](http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/03/12/209257). What's that? From [that very sane article](http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/03/12/209257) on the matter:

> It installs multimedia codecs that help you play sound and video files properly, all the usual Firefox plugins that you forget you need until you need them (Java, Flash, Adobe reader, MPlayer, etc.), archive support, Skype, an FTP client, several file-sharing programs, multimedia editors, a DVD ripper, RealPlayer, the Opera browser, and a lot more.

Now, download [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) and try it!

Making Linux easier for administrators, on the other hand: [GNOME 2.14](http://www.gnome.org/start/2.14/notes/en/rnadmins.html) helps admins to lock down computers and create profiles. Grand.

The Stockholm subway-system will probably have mobile-phone-free zones. How this will be worked out remains to be seen, but I think it's a good incentive. More on this, in Swedish, [here](http://mobil.mkf.se/ArticlePages/200603/15/20060315151950_AHD223/20060315151950_AHD223.dbp.asp).

I've just found some [extremely well-done t-shirts](http://imaginaryfoundation.com). Wow! I haven't seen such artistry on tees for a long time. Oh, surrealism, we do love you. As does [this man](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0130063tattoo1.html). And [this guy](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/dmilam1.html) wins all.

Oh, and don't forget: [Ceiling Cat](http://anthonybaxter.livejournal.com/83498.html) is watching.

Straight from Jim Gilliam's blog:

> Here's a [Quicktime](http://www.jimgilliam.com/video/2004-03-23_oreilly_sex_harass.mov) of Bill O'Reilly's 3/23/04 segment on women using sexual harassment "as a club."
> 
> Memorable quotes: Sexual harassment is "a problem the world over, no question." ... "Men -- and I know men real well, being a manly man -- are barbarians. They're just barbarians, OK." ... "It happens all the time where powerful men see a good- looking student, and they try to make a move." ... "obviously, I'm a big target."

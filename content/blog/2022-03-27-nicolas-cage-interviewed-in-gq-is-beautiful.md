Nicolas Cage.

> Cage wants to keep going with the indies. “I enjoy making movies like _Pig_ and _Leaving Las Vegas_ more than I enjoy making movies like _National Treasure,_” he says. He waves away suggestions that _National Treasure 3_ is happening, after I mention that Jerry Bruckheimer told me they were developing something. “When I talk about fair-weather friends in Hollywood, I'm not talking about Jerry. I'm talking about Disney,” he says. “They're like an ocean liner. Once they go in a certain direction, you've got to get a million tugboats to try to swivel it back around.”

This is a beautifully written interview with a very special individual.

So far, I'm counting three bizarre things that have happened to me today.

Upon exiting the tube, a man called me a fucking bastard. A few seconds later I heard him spewing obscenities to another person.

A couple of hours later a man referred to me as a "little girl" on the phone _while speaking with me_.

Just outside my office window - which, thankfully, I have to twist around in order to look through - there's an old man walking around wearing next to nothing. A colleague claims to having seen the man naked, peeing towards the office building where I work.

Needless to say, I'm longing to go home for the weekend.

[![Sub](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/1413893982_ta009afe.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/1413893982_ta009afe.jpg)_Submarines! No, birds! No, The Sea! Is it a Russian sea? Wait. What are we doing?_

Noo! I refuse to write something that's even remotely real about this farce, but I'll clue you in, pretending that you're not living in Sweden. Here's some background info for you (and yes, I understand if you close this fucking site right now):

In the 1980s, submarines were reported as seen in the Swedish archipelago. As rock-solid proof of this, somebody found tins of Russian-made soup and some Russian headgear on a rock or two (plus [a botched kidnapping](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/24/world/swedes-fear-a-russian-invasion-crime-gangs.html)) which - according to old men that were somehow handed airtime and Swedish tabloid media - proved that Lenin was about to re-spawn, invade Sweden and impose papercuts and communism on All Of Us.

Now, much didn't happen because of that. But as history often repeats itself, we can be sure to note that [people have recently seen more fucking submarines](http://www.thelocal.se/20141017/sweden-scrambles-against-foreign-activity-off-stockholm). Or rather, blurred pictures of what people think may be submarines. I wish all zealous atheists would direct their anger towards the old men who are hell-bent on shouting THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING!

Fucking crazy jingoism, this. People act completely nuts because of some minute shit that's going down, because it **may**, at some point in time, affect themselves. It's like The Fear of Ebola, even though we're not affected in the least.

If it bleeds, it leads, as the old newspaper saying goes, but what the fuck. Just check out the language in [this timeline](http://www.thelocal.se/20141021/the-mystery-submarine-a-timeline) of the submarine hunt: "Search continues 'at full strength'". "Armed Forces confirm they have received over 100 'interesting' tips from the public." My fave: "The Netherlands deny the craft is theirs." Well, it's not mine either. Wait a minute: which craft?

Now that I've rid my system of anger, please enjoy some new sounds instead of getting angry, yourself! To kick off, here's a band from Austin, TX; they're called Institute and I want their music:

Or The Hanged Man - aka [Rebecka](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/2448864822) and her cohorts - who is readying herself to release an album! Here's a prelude:

Or some angry fuzzed guitars thanks to The Beverleys?

Now, do you feel all of that submarine madness cleansing away?

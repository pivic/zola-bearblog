I've since long been an advocate of drunken cooking, of course not _too_ drunken, even though I can recall turning my parents' kitchen upside-down with my sister...wait, we were, like, 5 years old and threw eggs and flour over the entire kitchen while our parents were asleep. ((I can still vividly remember my mother's face when she first saw me standing on the kitchen table - naked - throwing eggs while my sister was spreading flour while pirouetting.))

No alcohol there, but still. The above video amends this. Some brilliant person has made a video of herself either being drunk and cooking, or we're talking about a good actor here. I laaaughed.

"_There is no right, there is no wrong. There is only food...and inedible._"

Awesome.

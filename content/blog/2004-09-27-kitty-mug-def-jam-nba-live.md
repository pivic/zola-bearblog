As you can see [here,](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-09-28/images/PICT0004.jpg) I've bought a grand kitty mug. It's big and really cool, and even though it cost a little bit of money, it's well worth the cause. And I've bought a "BEWARE OF CAT" sticker for Mikaela's mom.

I met Jesper after work. We went to S:t Eriksplan where he got hold of an Iron Maiden bootleg, a taped gig from the latest Stockholm concert. I wanted to get some new music but found nothing. I'm still stuck in listening a lot to [Brainpool](http://www.jimmyfun.se/artistsbrainpool.shtml)'s "Painkiller", a Swedish pop band whose members knew their way around pop music and nicked the good bits. It's fun to hear it, good pop songs, thoroughly worked-through. Too bad they turned crap when their lead singer quit and two of the remaining three members decided to sing themselves. Why does that always happen? OK, so Bernard Butler (off Suede) is a great guitarist, and he did have a great voice on his first solo single but turned shit instantly thereafter. John Squire (off The Stone Roses and Seahorses) is the worst ever guitarist-turned-singer. Johnny Marr, bless the man, showed promise when he sang and played "Meat Is Murder" live, but then again he was quite mellow in the voce department on that one; the Healers' albums have been crap this far though, mostly due to the poor voice, methinks.

Anyway, I got myself the kitty mug, a book on decorating by Conrad for Mikaela together with an assortment of chocolates and then Rade and I got some grand sushi from what's probably the best sushi place in Stockholm: Roppongi. We then went home to my place where we continued to rule in NBA Live 2004 (still waiting for NBA Live 2005...only a little more than a week to go!) and also tried a little Def Jam: Fight For NY.

As you can see, [I have perfected my little player's looks](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-09-28/images/PICT0003.jpg), but his skills are crap. I'm joking. His skills are poor and his looks are awful, of course. Mind you, he used to have a green afro.

Tomorrow Mikaela and I are going to IKEA, to get a new bed. We've just got our Tempur mattress, and I can't wait to sleep in it. It's like hovering on clouds, or so I've heard. A review is forthcoming!

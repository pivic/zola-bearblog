According to [this Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/google-accused-of-creating-spy-tool-to-squelch-worker-dissent), Google seem to have created a Chrome extension that monitors employees to find out when more than ten employees will meet at a time, in order to squelch dissent.

Earlier this month, employees said they discovered that a team within the company was creating the new tool for the custom Google Chrome browser installed on all workers’ computers and used to search internal systems. The concerns were outlined in a memo written by a Google employee and reviewed by Bloomberg News and by three Google employees who requested anonymity because they aren’t authorized to talk to the press.

From [this article on The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/10/24/google-accused-of-creating-surveillance-tool-to-monitor-employees-unionizing-efforts/#annotations:GxIiWvYzEemUVrdBJnyPeg):

What’s more, the development also comes amid a rise in employee activism within the company over the past few years.

Last year, Googlers organized [high-profile walkouts](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2019/04/23/google-walkout-organizers-publicly-accuse-google-of-punishing-them/) to call attention to the [company’s handling of sexual harassment allegations](https://thenextweb.com/business/2019/07/03/android-creator-andy-rubin-is-accused-of-running-a-sex-ring-in-new-unsealed-complaint/) and discriminatory labor practices.

Concerns were raised about the company‘s [Project Maven](https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/06/01/google-announces-it-wont-renew-military-ai-contract/) drone footage analysis program for the Pentagon, prompting the search behemoth to abandon the initiative. Then came [YouTube’s confusing policy decisions](https://thenextweb.com/google/2019/06/06/youtube-clumsily-tries-to-rectify-its-confusing-anti-harassment-policies-again/) regarding homophobia, and its participation in [Project Dragonfly](https://thenextweb.com/google/2019/07/18/google-officially-ends-its-chinese-search-engine-project/), a censored search product targeted at the Chinese market.

Earlier this week, Google’s top management in Switzerland office [unsuccessfully attempted to shut down plans](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-21/swiss-google-employees-defy-managers-stage-labor-event) for an employee-led talk on unionization, underscoring the mounting tensions between employees and the senior leadership.

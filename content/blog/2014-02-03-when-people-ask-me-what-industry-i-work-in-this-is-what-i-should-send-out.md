People I meet outside my professional network tend to go to sleep when I explain the type of industry I work in. The above video explains most of it, and I think you'll either be fascinated or close this window two seconds after starting the presentation. I mean, I really like working with tech support and that, but most of my friends don't want to hear a second of it, and I understand them fully.

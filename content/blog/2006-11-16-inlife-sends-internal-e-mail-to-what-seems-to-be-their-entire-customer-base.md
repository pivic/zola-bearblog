Avid readers of this blog might remember my dealings with a Swedish company named [inLife](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1065); they deal with retailing products mainly supplied by [Apple](http://apple.com), and probably cannot tell service from public execution. On Tuesday they sent me an e-mail with the subject "Webbmöte 061114". Here are the contents of said e-mail:

The list of recipients was quite long. Actually, _very_ long enough to make you think inLife haven't done what most people who handle professional send-outs do. Those people always make precautions so that e-mails meant to hit everybody on their address list aren't sent out to everybody at once, _in case an accident occurs_.

So, what now? One of my e-mail addresses is now out in the wild, spawning more spam than ever. I now have the e-mail address to 2500 of their customers. Or, wait. Those addresses have not been validated in any way. By simply reading said list for a few seconds, I've found explicit spam addresses and names such as "FONT.a .font", "Youve hateBush" and "fxgauoihbp". I've also found e-mail addresses to some very interesting people working against spam.

The company, inLife, has not sent out a public apology, nor a simple apology to their customers, regarding this acute error. In fact, they have not responded at all. Of course, any company with a real sense of service and professionalism would. It's one thing to make a mistake, but another to act like it never happened; for people that's bad, for companies it is unacceptable. By the way, their CEO never contacted me despite his "assurance" that the company he works for is "devoted to service".

P.s. I've obfuscated Mr. Sundberg's e-mail address in his automatic signature, to save him from spam.

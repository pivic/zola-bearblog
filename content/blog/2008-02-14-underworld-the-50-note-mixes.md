![Underworld](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-02-14-underworld.jpg)[Underworld](http://www.underworldlive.com) has just announced two fan-mixes of their music, available for free. Both are made by Jeb Edwards. [Here](http://www.50poundnote.net/downloads/underworldvol1.mp3) (103.8 MB, 192kbps, 1:15:31) is the first one and [here](http://www.50poundnote.net/downloads/underworldvol2.mp3) (97.2 MB, 192kbps, 1:10:42) is the second one.

The first mix contains the following tracks:

> Peggy Sussed (Pete Heller Vocal) Vanilla Monkey (Martinez Hungry Ghost Mix) JAL To Tokyo (Paul Woodford Vocal) Play Pig (Wighnomy & Robag Wruhme Moosmutzel With Melody) Mmm...Skyscraper, I Love You (Razormaid! Mix) Crocodile Beautiful Burnout Cowgirl (Futureshock Mix) Rez Born Slippy .NUXX (Atomic Hooligan Mix) Play Pig (Pig & Dan Re-mix 3)

The second mix contains these:

> Dinosaur Adventure 3D Kittens (Live in Japan '99) Two Months Off Juanita/Kiteless Push Upstairs (Darren Price Remix) Jumbo (Original Mix | Rob Rives & Francois K. Main Dish) Moaner (Live in Holland '99) Doot Doot (Extended Mix) by Freur

In case you haven't heard them, Underworld used to be a trio that made terrific, trancey techno stuff, and who have now - in my opinion - slipped a lot. I loved them up to and including the album "Beaucoup Fish". For more information, check [their Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld_(band)).

Bonus thanks to [Mr. Kotta](http://kotta.se): check out [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opaeNiiizxo) of Freur, "Doot Doot", where Karl Hyde used to sing and play the guitar. Wonderful 80's magic.

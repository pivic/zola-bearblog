Just received this text from Agria, the company that insures Blixa:

> Hej, vi ser att S\*SKINDIVIDUAL PANNACOTTA fyller år idag, vi önskar er en härlig dag tillsammans!

That's "Hello, we note that it's S\*SKINDIVIDUAL PANNACOTTA'S birthday today, we wish you a lovely day together!".

Naw! I know it's automatically sent, but still! And yes, that's Blixa's real name. Her breeder once asked for a series of names she could name her litter after, and I suggested serial killers. She went for Italian desserts.

Congratulations, lovely dauuuughter!

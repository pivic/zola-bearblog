Apart from [Bush II's regime craving even more money to rape and rule the world](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4204257.stm), I've been hearing music.

A little bird told me that [Daft Punk](http://daftpunknet.free.fr)'s coming album isn't what it should be. I mean, it's filled with old-school electronica à¡ la [Jean Jacques Perrey](http://www.jeanjacquesperrey.com), but they've lost the dancy, fun touch, except for the first track. I've been told.

[Doves](http://www.doves.net) are heading out with a new album as well, that might well be better than "[The Last Broadcast](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/d/doves/last-broadcast.shtml)", their last album, which was very good.

I'm so tired right now. I've had the emergency phone at work, so people can call in whenever and just say the darndest things. The best one today:

Me: IT, this is Niklas speaking. User: Hellooo, I'm...having problems with my computer. Me: Oh, what problems? User: Wait. \[two minutes and thirty seconds later\] User: It may be solved now. \[hangs up\]

I'd lerv an espresso, a [Segafredo Extra Strong](http://www.segafredo.it/homepage.htm), my favourite espresson coffee. I'm falling asleep now, and I'm meeting Rade tonight. Sadly no NBA Live 2005, but I can't be bothered. I'm spaced out. I'll probably rue those words in a while after having been fed sushi.

Breakfast in bed - finally, with a new tray. Scrambled eggs with spinach and feta cheese...yum.

Meeting up Marielle together with X on the roof at Slakthuset. Having a drink outdoors with friends - I can't begin to define how lovely it is. Everyone's senses and mood seem heightened just due to warm weather and no rain. Blissful.

We went on a hike a couple of days ago! Stage one of Sörmlandsleden, it was great! I've never been a guy who loves hikes, nature, et cetera, but...this could be the turning point.

My Dearest X. I love her looking existential and beautiful, which is actually always the case.

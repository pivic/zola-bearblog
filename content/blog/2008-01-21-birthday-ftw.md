Both X's and my folks came over on Saturday, all intent with celebrating my 31st birthday. Yay, me! I survived.

Having received a lot of nice, materialistic things, my dad became hellbound with the thought of getting all our new (and old) lamps in place; I'm not very handy - according to some bad rumours, despite [proof of this evidently not being true](http://vimeo.com/463786) - so dad sorted out my poor handimanship and got everything in its right place. Here's a video to show him working with Ullis (X's mom) while everybody looked on, and I filmed - which X wasn't very fond of:

    

OK, OK, I'm working already! In the end everything got tied up nicely and we even had wonderful birthday cake - the home-made version courtesy of Ethel and the other courtesy of Almondy, _[X's cake of choice](http://www.almondy.com/2.1.4.html)_ - with coffee and buns. Nice indeed!

After a while they all went home. The evening was FTW. I'll let X describe [the rest of the evening](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2008/01/21/how-to-have-a-happy-birthday)...thanks to everybody attending, despite the very little time you got to get over, and in case you're a friend who's reading this wondering _why the hell wasn't I invited?_ please don't fret, my mind is tiny and my memory tinier still (if possible), and when the time comes for our housewarming party, you'll get invited. Thanks for all the gifts, but most of all, thank you for your wonderful company; without you, I'm nothing. And to my sweetheart: thanks for everything. You mean more to me than I will ever be able to express, but I do keep trying and one of these days I might somehow gush it all out and most likely die from lack of oxygen in the process. You're the love of my life.

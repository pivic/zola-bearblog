[**Deaf Center**](http://typerecords.com/artists/deaf-center). Wow.

The Norwegian two-piece of Erik Skodvin and Otto Totland forge a brave palette of eerie, beautiful, industrial foreboding.

Be sure to get this. And the [Bleep 100 tracks of 2011](http://bleep.com/index.php?page=dynamic&module=100tracks2011#) while you're at it; you won't come across a better (and possibly longer) compilation of electronic tracks from 2011.

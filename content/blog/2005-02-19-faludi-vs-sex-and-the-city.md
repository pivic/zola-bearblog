Nah, nothing from Susan. But it's the backlash again, people.

As Mikaela is plowing through her "Sex and the City" DVD-box and it's hitting the end of the road, there are a few very interesting issues. At one point, the lead figure ("Carrie") meets her "role model", who has "everything"; a very nice apartment, loads of money and everything she could wish for when it comes to her profession. But when she sees "her man" with somebody else and is happy, it throws her into madness as "we're all raw underneath the surface", as Carrie series says. I can only find this happening to women in the series, though.

Sure, it's about four women, but as men is a very big part of their lives, it's interesting to see how the genders become puppets, mere archetypes of what I consider to be men and women: individuals who aren't made out of some Reaganesque stereotypical template based on their sex. I haven't seen very much of "Sex and the City", but as Mikaela's watching it intensively, it's in the background as I type this. At the same time, I could easily remove myself from the series when Mikaela's watching, but it's interesting to view the enemy in action, like watching FOX or [CBS](http://mediamatters.org/items/rss/200502180005). Here we go:

A leading lady of the series ("Miranda") has a baby and lives on her own. She tries, yet cannot combine a successful career with rearing a child and (at the same time, would you believe it) having sex with somebody (=the man couldn't stand the baby screaming, and as she picked up the child and it immediately stopped screaming, she found she was "somebody else"). Why am I imagining she'd be able to do all of the above (except for having a job, as that's The Man's Task, erhhhm), if she were married with a man? Hm. It's the Reagan era of antifeminism here, wee!

When single and working, women are miserable. If they have a kid and are single, they're horribly mislead in life. Where's the man? Hm. It has to be a man, right? [Lesbians aren't even allowed, especially if you're Bill O'Reilly](http://mediamatters.org/items/rss/200502170007).

"Why is it we believe everything that people say to us that isn't even true?", says Carrie. Well, I feel most people don't. I do, however, feel people should question "facts" more. To me it's obvious that at the same time as "Sex and the City" mostly is an apocalyptic windbag of antifeminism, it's of course pro-feminism in a way; exposing women who have casual sex is good. Simply because that's life. Women and men have sex with both genders, things and, eh, George W. Bush.

I'm just amazed that some people won't question the backlash more than they do. [And go read Susan Faludi's book on it, soon, please.](http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_02.11.93/ARTS/bo0211d.htm)

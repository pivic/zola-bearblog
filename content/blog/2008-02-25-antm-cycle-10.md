It would, without a doubt, be stupid not to mention that America's Next Top Model cycle 10 has started broadcasting in the USA. As I have very good eye-sight, I can see to the states, and hence follow said series.

The first episode kicked off, and as I've rarely mentioned this series in the past, I do have reason for it now.

Fatima words off Shayla Ali - who is Muhammed Ali's niece - and says she's "too ghetto". Fatima then got flack from Shalynda, who turned town crier and called herself a bitch. Start watching the below video at 1:35. Fatima drops the bomb at 1:55. I nearly cried when watching this. Mentally, I did. "Can I call you 'bitch'?" Brilliant. I'm eagerly awaiting episode 2.

I really like this film. Think "[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency](http://www.douglasadams.com/creations/0671746723.html)" crossed with a good film on relations (like, say, "[Lord of The Flies](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=43)") and you have "I Heart Huckabees". The characters are great, and [Lily Tomlin](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005499) really is good. Her part reminded me of the character [Holly Hunter](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000456) plays in the totally underestimated "[A Life Less Ordinary](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119535)".

See "I Heart Huckabees"! Dream-like, existentialistic, constantly questioning the viewer (or not), it's a great film. The soundtrack is what I can describe as nice, without trying to be the least ironic. The film lingers in mind without any pain mefeels, but I think I'll wait a while before I re-see it. Seriously, go see this film. Just don't expect a Hollywood film and you'll do alright. Maybe.

This summer Microsoft will release version 7 of Internet Explorer. Bill Gates has said something about "Microsoft's" needs to "go further to defend users from phishing as well as deceptive or malicious software." He also, according to [this article](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/15/gates_denmark_suppor.html) , have something to say to the Prime Minister of Denmark:

> Bill Gates flew to Denmark and told the Prime Minister that if he didn't support European software patents, Gates would shut down a Danish software company that Microsoft had acquired, costing Denmark 800 IT jobs.

[Media Matters](http://mediamatters.org), in essence, is like punching yourself in the face; it's a fact (the punching) and it hurts. It shows how the right-wing celebrity politicians from the USA are lying like hell. I'm sure the left-wingers are doing it as well, yet I'd like to see as sophisticated as the reports are at Media Matters regarding it, before I touch it; they're full of facts, and that always works in my book. Reading just a few lines of MM's top headlines, daily, will spark the following questions:

1\. Why isn't FOX Networks banned off the airwaves for constantly lying? 2. Why haven't the US population overthrown their current, evil, lying, destroying, fascist, tyrannical government yet? 3. Why hasn't a tsunami killed the Bush family?

Maybe some more relevant questions will spring to mind. Like number three in the list. Anyway, it's a very good forum for thought.

Time to sleep, dear reader. But before I do, I must say that [The Perceptionists](http://www.theperceptionists.com)' coming album, "Black Dialogue", is extremely good. Go buy it.

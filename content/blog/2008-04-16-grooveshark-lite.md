I like Grooveshark lite, a free site by a company that's created a P2P-client and now lets you partake of all their MP3's. I've created a little film that allows you to see how the site works, so to see it, click [here](http://screencast.com/t/3oOxS23Oxrg).

Here's a snippet from [TechCrunch's article on the matter](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/15/grooveshark-launches-web-media-player/):

> For those unfamiliar with the company, Grooveshark allows users to upload and share their music collection with friends, but with a twist: every song uploaded can be purchased DRM-free with the uploader getting a cut of each sale (the rest goes to the record companies, and the service is 100% legal).
> 
> The new Grooveshark Lite player is not dissimilar to what Last.fm offers, but without the silly restrictions like being able only play the single five times. It also helps that Grooveshark has a huge selection of music; I don't have comparable numbers but Grooveshark returned better results on a couple of more obscure searches, where as Last.fm failed or only had 30 seconds of the song.

Nice. We need more ways to listen to and buy obscure tracks/albums/artists through the web, without having to register.

By the way, [Allmusic](http://allmusic.com) seems set on revamping their site again, giving its users more music and info, but nobody knows how it'll look or when it'll happen.

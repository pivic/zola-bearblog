Because of **Morrissey**'s "_[Autobiography](https://niklasblog.com/?p=14314)_" and his tendency to list music he's listened to and loved, [here](http://www.deezer.com/en/playlist/612697825?app_id=100023)'s the playlist in Deezer, and [here](http://open.spotify.com/user/gregster1978/playlist/1huKfcdjMORD7Fb3rSsbty)'s the one for Spotify.

[The Guardian put the information about all this so succinctly](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/22/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police), that I will choose to quote Julia Carrie Wong who wrote the article:

> In the aftermath of the uprising in Ferguson, Missouri, over the killing of Michael Brown, police departments and policy makers around the country hit upon a supposed panacea to racist policing and police brutality: body-worn cameras.
> 
> Many hailed the move as a victory for accountability. But among the few dissenters was Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice and a leader in the Black Lives Matter network, who [warned](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/05/civil-rights-rules-for-body-cameras/393377/) [early and often](https://psmag.com/news/what-the-body-cameras-cannot-see) that the cameras could become tools of surveillance against people of color because “body-worn cameras don’t watch the police, they watch the community being policed, people like me”.
> 
> The scope and scale of that surveillance became clearer Tuesday, when the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California released a [collection of public records](https://www.aclunc.org/blog/amazon-teams-law-enforcement-deploy-dangerous-new-face-recognition-technology) detailing how Amazon has been marketing and selling facial recognition software, called Amazon Rekognition, to law enforcement agencies.

So in other words, the biggest retail giant in the world is selling American identities to make more money.

It's good to know why Jeff Bezos needs his space ships.

Back in the day - or rather, in 1994 - I used to play in a band called Fryday. We picked that name due to our bassist being a [Primus](http://www.primusville.com) fan. Anyway, our line-up was a trio: Monika played drums and sang ((And wrote every track we played, sans a couple of covers.)), Tomas played the bass guitar and I used the penis substitute guitar to the best of my knowledge. As I was too poor to own a guitar of my own, I had to lend the one that was found in the rehearsal-room; yep, the room shared by appx. 20 other bands, the one left with one or two strings. And I couldn't tune the thing. It was quite funny to have visitors, who watched our drummer tune my guitar for me, but when I got hold of my three strings...my god, did I suck, but we did have a lot of fun.

This track is actually off a demo that we recorded by mistake; we were auditioning a new drummer who seemed OK, so we told him he was in the band. He then told us his dad owned a studio, and hey, wouldn't we like to record a little just so he could learn the drum-parts? _Record_? For _free_? Erhm. Yes.

When we arrived his dad said hi and confiscated my distortion-box for the guitar; "Nobody uses distortion anymore." This was in the hey-day of everybody from [Nirvana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)) to [Rage Against The Machine](http://www.ratm.com) and [Dinosaur Jr](http://www.dinosaurjr.com) used as much distortion as they could find...the grunge-era. I didn't complain. What could I say? ((Probably something along the lines of "Fuck you/I won't do what you tell me", but being myself in those days, I'd rather hide.)) As temporary solace, I was allowed to use one of his guitars that actually sported more than three strings. Fair enough.

I transferred the demo from cassette to MP3 a few years back, so here you go, one of Monika's finest achievements, "Swimming"; the play-button is a bit down in the middle, just below the screw.

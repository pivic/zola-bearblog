According to Ron Suskind, [in an article published in the New York Times today](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html) \[registration required to read it\], Dubya asked why Sweden was included when discussing which military forces should be sent to the Middle East during 2002: "They don't have an army". That's Dubya forya.

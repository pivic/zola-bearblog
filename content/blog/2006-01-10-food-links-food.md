[![Poseur](http://static.flickr.com/39/83871034_5b72dd43a5_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=83871034)Mikaela and I visited Frederic on Sunday, where we spent time toying with Little Miu, one of his two kitties. He'd made a cake the day before, so we had coffee with that and a nice time, like a [party of old-skool Englishpeople](http://www.kristianhoffman.com/images/mumps/mumps-tea-party.jpg). So apart from that, what have I been up to? For start, I haven't been blogging due to loads of work. Returning from a week of vacation can be great, but this time work had mounted. A great thing, though, is that we're busy installing new computers for a lot of users, which means I get out a lot, to install computers and hence, I get to see the nice people who are working for The Swedish Social Services in Stockholm. If you don't know it, I work as one out of five Network Administrators at this joint, and I must say the ethical factor makes a big difference. I really love helping people (who help people). Anyway, time for links again as that's all I have time for this one around.

Do you use Firefox, have got hold of a long URL that you'd like to shorten? Then [TinyURL Creator](http://www.roundtwo.com/product/tinyurl) is for you. Works brilliant. Just right-click the page holding the URL you'd like to shorten, pick "Create TinyUrl for this Page" and it's created _and_ copied into your clipboard.

I'm not as into typography as I should be, but while checking [Typographica's favourite fonts of 2005](http://typographi.com/001045.php) I get restless. At least in part.

If you're a photographer living in New York, check [this](http://insignificantthoughts.com/?p=1762) on your rights. It's guaranteed to be interesting for all American photographers.

Did you know you can get hold of a little The Daily Show through [their RSS feeds](http://www.comedycentral.com/rss/index.jhtml)?

[Here](http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/11/the_zen_estheti.html)'s an interesting post on a few points one should (according to me) keep in mind while holding a presentation, it compares [Steve Jobs](http://apple.com TARGET=) ' presentations to those held by [Bill Gates](http://microsoft.com).

Need to have a to do-list you can get hold of online and share? That will send you an e-mail, a message through your IM-software and an SMS? Try [Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com), a nice site with a bad name. I'm trying it now and will see if I really need it. We'll just see. I rarely use tasks in MS Outlook (which I use to sync the calendar in my mobile phone)

I like the idea of [Clusty](http://clusty.com). It's a new search engine, that clusters results. For example, if you search for "batman", the left-hand frame will cluster answers according to category, like "Batman Begins", "Comic, book", "Photos", and so on. Interesting and quick.

[![Potatoe salad](http://static.flickr.com/41/84517087_5a904b53d9_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=84517087)Oh, yesterday Mikaela made a very nice potatoe salad with smoked mackerel. Very nice, very intense, oh-so-delicious, especially with a light Rioja wine, e.g. [Conde de Valdemar gran reserva 1998](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=84517196).

WordPress user! Do you want to use another editor than the two ones available in WordPress 2.0? Check out [EditorMonkey](http://www.rajprasad.net/plugins/editormonkey).

I've written about Office Online 3 [before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=776), a way to edit and store MS Office-compatible files online, through a web browser. Now, there's [Writely](http://www.writely.com), another way to create, edit, store and convert MS Word-compatible files online. I haven't tried it, but it looks interesting. [Here](http://www.writely.com/BasePage.aspx?action=tour)'s the tour of the product.

When it comes to creating tutorials and creative, educational films, I've tried [Camtasia Studio](http://www.techsmith.com), which has worked well but cannot provide some of the new tools that [Macromedia Captivate](http://www.macromedia.com/software/captivate) offers; on the other hand, this program doesn't capture everything like Camtasia Studio does. Now, there's a semi-new kid on block, that's entirely free and available both for Linux and Windows. It's called [Wink](http://www.debugmode.com/wink), and I'm definitely gonna try it, having seen [this screencast](http://www.tokash.org/gregarius/gregariusScreencast.htm) that displays how Gregarius works.

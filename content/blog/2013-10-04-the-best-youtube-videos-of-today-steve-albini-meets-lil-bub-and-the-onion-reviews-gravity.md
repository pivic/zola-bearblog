I knew nothing about [Lil Bub](http://lilbub.com) until I just saw this video, where the cat interviews [Steve Albini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini), a long-time favorite music engineer and producer. His most recent outing is his work on the Super Deluxe Edition of Nirvana's "**[In Utero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Utero_(album))**" album, one of the best remixes I've ever heard. He also produced the original album. But stuff that, just see the vid:

This video review of "[**Gravity**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468)", a space movie, is already classic:

I live in an apartment complex a few stories up. Garbage is collected into bags that are tossed into a communal garbage chute, which can be accessed from every floor of the building. When I dispose of my garbage, I throw it into the chute; when the garbage bag just makes a fop sound as it goes through the inlet and then disappears down the chute without hitting the back wall - I just love that feeling.

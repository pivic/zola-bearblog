I know you wanted it, so here it is: my video from [All Tomorrow's Parties as curated by Explosions In The Sky](http://www.atpfestival.com/archive/archived_event.php?archive=112). It features:

- A Hawk And A Hacksaw
- Dinosaur Jr
- ...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead
- Silver Jews
- Jens f-ing Lekman
- De La Soul
- Raekwon and Ghostface
- Silver Jews
  

Plus entertainment extravaganza:

- Frankfurt airport
- Travelling from Cardiff towards Minehead
- ATP bingo!
- Hanging out at ATP
- Patrick Pestorius dancing
- X tapping her hands and drinking wine
  

Now, before you say _What the hell? Where's Okkervil River in all this?_ I say check [this page](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1471) where you'll find the entire video of their gig at ATP. Yeah, they got their own video, because they're so speshul. I love them, that's why. For pictures that we all snapped at ATP, check [this post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1473).

Enjoy!

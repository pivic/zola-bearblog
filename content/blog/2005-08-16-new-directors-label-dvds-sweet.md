I just found out that there are new Directors Label DVD's coming! Apparently this news popped in July, but I just found out by [browsing Anton Corbijn's site](http://www.corbijn.co.uk/page_works_ph_dir_dvd.htm). Here are the names of the directors whose videos will be popping come 2005-09-13: [Anton Corbijn](http://www.palmpictures.com/videos/thedirectorslabelvol4theworkofdirectorantoncorbijn.html): best video: too many to mention, among them Depeche Mode's "Behind The Wheel", Joy Division's "Atmosphere", Front 242's "Tragedy For You" (which is not included in this release, unless it's the very covertly titelled "Front By Front") and of course the seminal "Heart Shaped Box" by Nirvana. [Jonathan Glazer](http://www.palmpictures.com/videos/thedirectorslabelvol5theworkofdirectorjonathanglazer.html): best video: Radiohead's "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" [Mark Romanek](http://www.palmpictures.com/videos/thedirectorslabelvol6theworkofdirectormarkromanek.html): best video: [Nine Inch Nails' "Closer"](http://www.markromanek.com/video/09.html) [Stephane Sednaoui](http://www.palmpictures.com/videos/thedirectorslabelvol7theworkofdirectorstephanesednaoui.html): best video: Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Give It Away"

You can get the discs individually, or you could just do what I will: get [the DVD box set](http://www.palmpictures.com/videos/thedirectorslabelseriesboxset24dvds.html).

The sets are all accompanied by a 56-page booklet plus mini-films, commercials, et.c. It'll be interesting to see how Glazer will compete with the rest, as his work, in my mind, doesn't stand out remotely as well as the others', Corbijn being my favourite with Romanek trailing.

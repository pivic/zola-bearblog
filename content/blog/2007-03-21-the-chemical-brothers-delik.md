![2007-03-21-chembros.jpg](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-03-21-chembros.jpg)Available off the bonus disc from their compilation known to humans as "[Singles 93-03](http://shop.thechemicalbrothers.com/mall/productpage.cfm/Chemsshop/100017)", this is a twist on their single "[Life Is Sweet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upDnBXax4U4)", originally featuring Tim Burgess from [The Charlatans](http://www.thecharlatans.net).

I've loved The Chems ever since I heard "In Dust We Trust" off a compilation album that came with an old issue of Q Magazine (("_Assorted_", January 1995)) - that track took me completely by surprise where bongos tapped the intro to crazy, swirling, Moogish synths, a metallic scratching and - the bassline rippling down my spine...ow. Was this what I was looking for? Somehow I came over another track (("Song To The Siren")) from the same album, and I was instantly hooked.

The album is "[Exit Planet Dust](http://www.discogs.com/release/38814)".

I bought it using the first scraps of my teenager's salary on the way to work, worked all day, got home and put on the album, and heard the intro track, "Leave Home", killing me with its immediate Kraftwerk-drone, looped voice chanting "The brothers gonna work it out..." and I knew I'd found home even before the staccato bass kicked into action, plunging the knife further into me.

Even though "Delik" is a rehash of "Life Is Sweet", it stands up in its own right as it's simply too extreme a remix of the original; the brothers have merely kept a couple of strands of vocal and added a bunch of drum-loops, keeping the funk alive. Ka-plaah! _Dance!_ Electronic funk in a one-inch punch.

**edit**: the brothers are back! I just received a fan-letter sent by the boys, introducing "We Are The Night" - their next album, which will drop in June. On Friday they'll announce tickets for a gig at the Roundhouse in London, on 2007-05-31. Come to Stockholm soon, please...

As usual, the track will be deleted after a week.

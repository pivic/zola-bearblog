[![Tours of the Black Clock](http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1391798943m/7839.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7839)[Tours of the Black Clock](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7839) by [Steve Erickson](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5279)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/830060558)  
  
This is a compact book. The contents seem effortlessly written, and read like watching water flowing. There's no hardship in reading this book, apart from the contents; I won't go into details that may spoil this for you, but it's big, and I actually felt as though two books had finished by the time I was 11% into it.

The author's use of language is commendable, as it's easy to read and digest, while the characters and their inner thoughts are less palatable (to me, at least), but are so interesting, that I kept wanting more and more of the book. After half of it, interest waned, but picked up again after circa 70%.

I'll recommend this to all; it's a two-punch book, first for the use of language which I've seldom seen, and second, for the contents; the plot twists, turns, churns and is truly imaginative. Shan't say more. Go read.

[Soul Position](http://www.myspace.com/soulposition) is a hip-hop-duo consisting of hailed producer [RJD2](http://www.rjd2site.com) and rapper [Blueprint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint_(rapper)), who have been around a little while, making music much in the same sense as [James Brown](http://www.funky-stuff.com/jamesbrown) and the [Native Tongues-posse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Tongues_Posse) have, using socially conscious lyrics combined with hip-shaking music to make you think and move at the same time - imagine that! The band has just released [a new album](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5KU88) called "Things Go Better With RJ And AL", and it's very good.

The track you're being proffered right now is a kind of list of advice to young girls, growing up. From the top of the song:

> **Kid**: Hey uncle, whatchu doin'? **Blueprint**: Aw, just, uh, writin', just writin' down my thoughts. Little song I'm trying to finish up. **K**: Yeah? What's it about? **B**: Well, it's kind of about, you know, girls, um, they grow up, and how they be feelin' pressure an' stuff, of boys, and...just advice I have to give you some day. **K**: Can I hear it?

And the song kicks off. You have to hear it! As usual, I'm not making money off this, and will most definitely remove this song in a week. [Buy the album](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5KU88)!

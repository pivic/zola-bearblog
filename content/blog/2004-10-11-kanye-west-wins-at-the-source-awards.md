[Kanye West won a lot of Source awards](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3732784.stm), but that doesn't mean much as a lot of people criticize the awards for being fake. It's fun to see Chingy winning "single of the year" for "Right Thurr", basically a very nauseating song that gets on your nerves and stays there until it wears you down and you start using "thurr" instead of...well, any word, basically. It's all because that song is included in the NBA Live 2004 soundtrack.

Speaking of which, why didn't EA Games include any good music in NBA Live 2005?

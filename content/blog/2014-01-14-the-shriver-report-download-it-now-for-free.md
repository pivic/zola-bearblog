So, what is The Shriver Report? From the organisation itself:

> A Woman’s Nation has released its third in a series of Shriver Reports, A Woman’s Nation Pushes Back from the Brink, in partnership with the Center for American Progress. It can be downloaded for FREE now through January 15th.
> 
> The report is a groundbreaking investigation into the millions of women who are doing it all and barely scraping by, struggling to provide and parent in a nation that hasn’t kept pace with the modern realities of their lives. It combines research, analysis and ideas from the nation’s top academic institutions and think tanks, essays by leading thinkers, stories of real women struggling with our modern economy, and a comprehensive poll.
> 
> The report is exclusively available on Amazon’s Kindle and Kindle App (see below for more details) and will be available free of charge until 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, January 15th, and is a product of A Woman’s Nation™ and the Center for American Progress.

[William Blum](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/obituaries/william-blum-dead.html) became 85 years old.

Noam Chomsky made me discover William Blum thanks to the latter's book named "_[Americaâ€™s Deadliest Export: Democracy](https://niklasblog.com/?p=17765)_".

He should be remembered for his excellent, piercing views on US foreign policy and forgotten because of his views of the women who accuse Julian Assange of rape.

This is his last missive:

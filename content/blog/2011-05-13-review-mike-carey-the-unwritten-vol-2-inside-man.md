[![The Unwritten Vol. 2: Inside Man](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1281559069m/7776019.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7776019-the-unwritten-vol-2)[The Unwritten Vol. 2: Inside Man](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7776019-the-unwritten-vol-2) by [Mike Carey](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9018.Mike_Carey)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/167068427)  
  
This was quite a treat.  
  
As Tom Taylor continues surveying the Universe as he once knew it to be, it continues crashing around him. As he is wanted for multiple murder, he is also being desired by different creatures alive and dead, from his ordinary world as well as from fables and his vanished father.  
  
And Mingus, the winged cat, is cute as a button.  
  
All in all: exciting, making me long for the third collection of stories regarding...all of this.

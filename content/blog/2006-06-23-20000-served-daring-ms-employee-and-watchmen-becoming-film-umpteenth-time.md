Now that 20000 people have visited this blog through the years, actually doubling the amount [since April last year](https://niklasblog.com/?p=559), it's yet again time to list some of the weirdest things people have been searching for at Google, Yahoo! and the likes - ending up at my site:

> fuck poitier MacBook problems Henrik Pontén Impossible d' installer WDS dans Outlook d' Office 2007 serial office 2007 gay niklas berlusconi fake south park cousin kyle retractable baton

I'm still confused on how that last row turned up, actually.

Philip Su, Microsoft employee, has turned into disser extraordinaire; the constructive critisism he has unleashed in [this blog-post](http://blogs.msdn.com/philipsu/archive/2006/06/14/631438.aspx) of his is massive. Among the scathing details:

> \[...\]building Windows on a dual-proc dev box takes nearly 24 hours\[...\] Assuming there are 5 years between when XP shipped and when Vista ships, those quick on the draw with calculators will discover that, on average, the typical Windows developer has produced one thousand new lines of shipped code per year during Vista. \[...\] They simply stopped telling the truth \[...\]

Of course, those little quotes are merely meant to be brow-raising, but please, check out Su's post if you feel you're huffing. If you're doing so because you think I write too much about tech: blaargh! Or get me some [Futurama-episodes from the future](http://slashdot.org/articles/06/06/23/0117229.shtml), please.

On a more bizarre note, [Akismet](http://akismet.com), the only spam-catcher I'm using on my blog these days, has just snagged the 10000th spam-comment. I don't think more than perhaps 50 have escaped the net since it's been implemented.

[I've written about it before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=534), but now [The Guardian](http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1804428,00.html) relights the story: Alan Moore's (with Dave Gibbons on ink) epic "Watchmen" is becoming film - for the umpteenth time. From the linked-to article:

> Hollywood's on-again, off-again adaptation of the cult graphic novel Watchmen looks set to go ahead with the arrival of hot young director Zack Snyder. The project has had a chequered development history, having undergone numerous false starts with the likes of Terry Gilliam, Paul Greengrass and Darren Aronofsky being attached and then unattached to it.

Scary. I don't think Moore opts to say anything about the film, as he has chosen to do with other films that have turned into bad cover-versions of his novels, e.g. "V For Vendetta" and "The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen".

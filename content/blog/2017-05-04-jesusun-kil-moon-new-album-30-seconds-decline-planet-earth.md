I didn't expect **[Jesu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesu_(band))** and [**Sun Kil Moon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Kil_Moon) to release a new album about two months after Sun Kil Moon's "_Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood_" came out; I liked that album. This new one - "_30 Seconds to the Decline of Planet Earth_" - sounds like it's even better. It's really good. Jesu makes the music, sends it to [Mark Kozelek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kozelek) who adds lyric and song, and it's out.

[Here](http://www.sunkilmoon.com/30seconds/)'s the album in its whole for streaming. Kozelek talk-sings of meeting fans, Lou Reed, Laurie Anderson, seeing the film "Spotlight", where pedophiles are on a list, calling someone a "little crack whore", Slenderman, Trump. Another straight-up track, "_[He's Bad](http://www.sunkilmoon.com/hesbad/)_".

_"We've been surpassed by technology" "The night was magical and humored and dark" "Enough for 30 seconds I hear sirens closing up and trailing off"_

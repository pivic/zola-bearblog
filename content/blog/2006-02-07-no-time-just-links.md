[![From my living-room](http://static.flickr.com/27/95700475_b5c2d74bb2_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=95700475) As there's no time for writing about life in general, here are a bunch of links as usual. Heavy on tech, they're also, I might add, hopefully helping you out à¡ la Lifehack, as I love to litter your life with links that help, rather than just take your time away.

So, what's new in the Google Empire? Well, they're [incorporating a chat client into GMail](https://mail.google.com/mail/help/chat.html). As this is comforting to you, remember: they're already indexing every single e-mail you receive and send, opting to store this info and use it any way they please. _They_ please, mind you. Just imagine what fun their marketing people will have with your chat-data. If you're keen to try out the GMail Chat-functionality over a web-page already, try out the AJAX-y [Gtalkr](https://gtalkr.com), which is not affiliated with Google. By the way, [this](http://www.technologyreview.com/InfoTech/wtr_16005,308,p2.html?PM=GO) is a very interesting article that you should read, before taking in GMail completely.

Morrissey is taking off again with his new album and a coming tour; the [tickets for Sweden](http://tinyurl.com/8lkxm) are released on Monday morning, and if you want to, listen to one of the songs off his coming album through a streaming web-page, you can do that, right [here](http://www.myspace.com/morrissey).

Speaking of music, [the coming double-CD-compilation from Prince](http://www.rhinorecords.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=73381) (off Rhino), coinciding with the release of his coming CD, is interesting, but do check out [The Dresden Dolls](http://www.dresdendolls.com). Heavily piano-laden, tight-singing, simplistic-yet-complex band has got me by the gonads. One of the very few American indie-bands I actually enjoy; their own tag, "Brechtian Punk Cabaret", is a description very on-target, albeit they're better than that. I love their reverb-y, heavy sound, and the lyrics are good; a line like "is it man or Memorex" says a bit.

You need software to know what the MP3's you have really are encoded as? Check out [Audio Identifier](http://www.bitattack.com/catalog.html#AI), which is very nice.

If you've got an old iPod, why not [run it with Linux](http://ipodlinux.org/Main_Page) and get it playing several new codecs and film?

I'm very much into sparking a wiki at work, preferably one with a built-in ticket-handling-system, i.e. [Trac](http://www.edgewall.com/trac), but if you're on the look-out for a wiki, try the [Wiki Matrix](http://www.wikimatrix.org), where you can easily compare functions between loads of wikis. It seems a lot of big corporations love [TWiki](http://twiki.org), e.g. [Yahoo! that carries a +60GB TWiki](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Main/TWikiSuccessStoryOfYahoo). And don't worry if you merely want a very simple wiki, as there are some available that run straight out of one single HTML-file; I prefer [TiddlyWiki](http://www.tiddlywiki.com).

Speaking of wikis, I'm trying to get into using a calendar online. That's not a problem per se, as there are plenty of services that allow you to use online calendars, but synchronising them is a major bother. A lot of people seem to like [CalendarHub](http://calendarhub.com), but as it still doesn't allow synching with other iCal-compatible calendars that require a login, it's not really interesting. [30 Boxes](http://30boxes.com) is also enticing, but doesn't either allow synchronising. If you are, like me, using Outlook 2003 (because I have to synch my Pocket PC with it) you can actually export your calendar to the iCal-format, using [this freeware](http://remotecalendars.sourceforge.net/index.html) for Windows. Blast! I'm looking forward to controlling my calendars like [wasps control cockroaches](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/03/wasp_performs_roachb.html).

Interesting software, [Flickr Backup](http://sunkencity.org/flickrbackup) is. I'm Yoda, and it runs in Java. From the supplier: "Flickr Backup is a utility that allows you to download the pictures you have uploaded to Flickr back down to your computer for personal backup or restore." Very nice indeed! Download it [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/flickrbackup).

Speaking of software, don't miss out on [DEMO 06](http://www.demo.com), where a load of systems and apps are making their way into the limelight of the Internet (...) soon enough. Yeah, right - like GMail will ever come out of its beta-crypt; anyway, check out [this little collection of news from the conference](http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=2536).

As always, you'll find this playlist with my others right [here](http://spotify.pivic.com).

So, I've been a busybody?

> "You are Holmes, the meddler." My friend smiled. "Holmes, the busybody!" His smile broadened. "Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!" Holmes chuckled heartily. ((Culled from "[_The Adventure of The Speckled Band_](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes#The_Adventure_of_the_Speckled_Band)".))

Well, right I've been, compiling away. This time it's a list based on an assortment of tracks that I piled up for a morning this past weekend. The low-down:

First, Air with the lazy intro to Sofia Coppola's excellent trip film "_[The Virgin Suicides](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbz4-du3Ayg#t=6)_". I love the film, its air of laziness, hormones and pungent nothing happening in the middle of suburbia.

To contrast, Super Furry Animals' more commercial side, from what many a fan deemed the death of the band upon its release, the album "**[Rings Around The World](http://open.spotify.com/album/65p4IDupcLM4xhLU89YqWG)**".

Badly Drawn Boy seems forgotten. I've no idea what he's up to now, but I cannot erase the memory of the ugly hat he was prone to wearing the few really nice songs he conjured up for the film "_[About A Boy](http://open.spotify.com/album/04eNNm6nl6YzKkCfIFR7Rs)_", of which this track is very nice.

[X](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com) recently let me re-discover The Magnetic Fields, and I've owed her since. Well, before that, actually. And since losing to her in a game of cards yesterday I owe her a pony. Go figure. Anyway, TMF are an eclectic bunch, and the man who usually spear-heads the band, [Stephin Merritt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephin%20Merritt), doesn't sing here. Country-ish. Good. Go listen. The singer, [Claudia Gonson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Gonson), reminds me of Kirsty MacColl and [Maggie Reilly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCp57YGiEBU). The sweeping synths are just great.

I remember the days when Belle and Sebastian were unknown. There were no pictures of them available and they apparently recorded their material in a church in Scotland. Well, today their pusses adorn mags and the Internet for all to see, but this track is from one of their early albums and one of their first that I really loved. I remember growing up in [Hallunda](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=59.243333%2C17.825278&hl=en&z=16&ie=UTF8), where I walked snow-laden streets and listened to this album, seemingly forever.

Neko Case is one of the most played artists in one of my fave TV-shows, "[Veronica Mars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Mars)"; I think Neko's voice is one of the best modern voices. Full stop.

Reminiscing on, I remember seeing [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnANXROIGBo) of Bernard Butler and Brett Anderson doing it acoustic-style on MTV. Since then, it stuck. I've rarely been a fan of Anderson's lyrics and this is nearly the case here as well, but just watch Butler riding the chorus to the end, not to mention the intense original. Their b-side collection "**[Sci-fi Lullabies](http://open.spotify.com/album/20P8V8OEQIO5pNsVM5BNOf)**" is really good, even after Butler left Suede.

[![The Blues Brothers](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3655/3329199855_47d81a68e5.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernielevine/3329199855)

Au contraire to that, you'll have to dig hard to find a starker contrast to broody, English pop music than The Blues Brothers, despite their name; I love the film still after all these years, and even though I think this track - the only Spotified version of it that I could find, anyway - is cute, I don't think it's part of the original soundtrack. Still, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shaaaaake iiiiit.

To everybody who thinks Thin Lizzy was a bunch of guys unable to churn anything other than compressed rock out, check again! This compressed rock pop-gem is fiiine, as is Elton John's epic "_Tiny Dancer_" that seems to be a song that everybody loves. And I can't say anything but the same for the quite odd "_Feel Flows_" by The Beach Boys. I mean, they utilised a LOT of weird sounds, instruments and arrangements that worked beautifully together, but this track somehow travels over everything. I love it.

Pulp struck cocaine gold with "_Sylvia_", which I think is a really buried song from their even more buried album "**[This Is Hardcore](http://open.spotify.com/album/2hf0aTKqdxsobNVda2vvUz)**"; true, it's probably hard to try and top "**Different Class**", and judging from the liner notes for TIH, Jarvis Cocker was by then brought to the brink of extinction, hubris and the band was almost breaking up. Still, they created this. Oh.

I've never really liked Lee Hazlewood, until I heard this track where he moan-croons with Nancy Sinatra. His voice seems untrained, and at the same time nicely unkempt, especially in - apparently my fave word for this post - contrast with Nancy's weird, double-tempi chorus voice. And oh so many double entendres. Amazingly, Primal Scream churned out [a version](http://open.spotify.com/track/6kNYwTwanxLGrO1aZrxErN) of this same song too, with Kate Moss as Nancy.

Steven Georgiou picked the stage name Cat Stevens before converting to Islam, from where he picked the name Yusuf Islam and finally settled to call himself Yusuf in the music world. His old stuff is really good at times, and I really like this old acoustic-guitar-picker of a song.

Speaking of which, Tim Hardin - another artist I thank X for - first came to the recording world with "**[Teaser and the Firecat](http://open.spotify.com/album/1y8iPu3uWUQauSwqBdkITO)**", a seemingly horrid title for an album, but just listen to the arrangement. It's like silent is the new loud. Or black. Whateva. Hardin's solemn, very melodic sounds and his ability to lash out when it comes to volume is really special, keeping the volume meter in the red for a very short period of time.

## Breaking off the morning, heading into early afternoon

Kim introduced me to this track which hit me really hard, much like [the album cover](http://mixtape.rollingsouls.com/mixtape/wp-content/moderat-moderat-2009.jpg). This is one hell of a bass arpeggio assault. Dreamy, and you must surrender to it. As far as I can remember, I haven't felt like this for an electronic track since I heard Vitalic's masterpiece "_[Trahison](http://open.spotify.com/track/6eouYGSfcDirtm3u2Xtlqg)_". Must. Buy. Album.

The Go! Team seldom disappoints in energy and colour, and this track is no exception. Let it speak.

Then, back to solemn. The Velvet Underground's "_Sunday Morning_" is a perfect, dreary sucker of a song. With Nico, of course.

And to break it off, Broder Daniel, one of my fave Swedish cult groups, with a track that I recently re-affirmed by watching the very nice documentary "_[Broder Daniel Forever](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1459029)_" ((That I've reviewed [here](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1459029/usercomments-1).)). I recommend starting with their compilation album called "**[No Time For Us 1989-2004](http://open.spotify.com/album/5ebnp3ecKxew3JNAHxxTb5)**". I _love_ this track.

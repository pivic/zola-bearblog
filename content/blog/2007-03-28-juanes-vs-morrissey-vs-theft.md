As [our trainee](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/428504819) is still at my work-place he keeps letting me know more about his taste in music, that is, more than [he already has let shine through](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1194). He's apparently a little into [Juanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanes), a singer well-known in the Spanish community and to me, a little thief. Here's a phrase from his track "[La Camisa Negra](http://www.lyred.com/lyrics/Juanes/La+Camisa+Negra/Camisa+Negra)":

> Tengo la camisa negra porque negra tengo el alma; yo por ti perdi la calma y casi pierdo hasta mi cama

This is translated as follows:

> I wear the black shirt Because my soul is black I have lost my calm because of you And I have almost lost my bed

Those two last lines are irrelevant, but I had to include them just for laughs ((Of course, nobody knows whether the writer's reference to a bed was from The Smiths' "[A Rush And A Push And The Land Is Ours](http://www.compsoc.man.ac.uk/~moz/lyrics/strangew/arushand.htm)")). Now, his track was released in 2005. Here's a phrase from the song "[Unlovable](http://www.compsoc.man.ac.uk/~moz/lyrics/theworld/unloveab.htm)", as written by Morrissey for The Smiths:

> I wear Black on the outside 'Cause Black is how I feel on the inside

Our trainee also loves [Håkan Hellström](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kan_Hellstr%C3%B6m), a Swedish musician [who loans a few phrases off Morrissey now and again](http://www.morrissey-solo.com/articles/00/12/14/0816258.shtml); bastard.

Of course, you already _know_ that [Morrissey never, ever steals](http://www.compsoc.man.ac.uk/~moz/nicked.htm)...

_Oh mother_...

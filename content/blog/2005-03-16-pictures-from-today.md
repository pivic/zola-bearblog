[![](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-16-stairs.jpg)](http://www.niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-03-16/images/PICT0041.jpg)[Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-03-16) you'll find a gallery of pictures I took today. They're from my way to work, at work, of colleagues, a cleaner, my lunch and of Mikaela's lovely cookies.

Sadly, I didn't get a picture of the idiot from this morning. A woman carried two full bags of stuff and practically landed them in my lap. "Idiot", I thought. She then (accidentally, I guess) hit me on one of my knees using a hard PET-bottle; she hit hard and good right on a nerve. "God damn!" I thought, folded and looked into her eyes like a madman. She didn't seem to care, so she looked away. Idiot! So, I picked up the camera, went for flash and took her picture. She was blinded and shocked. Ha! Gotcha, idiot. Sadly, the picture didn't come out. But I had my revenge. Ha. Oh, little treasures.

[![69 Love Songs](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1293902270m/301879.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/301879) [69 Love Songs](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/301879) by [LD Beghtol](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/173987)  
My rating: [2 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/68151956)  
  
This book makes me thing of three things:

1\. LD Beghtol is extremely pretentious, which isn't always a bad thing 2. This book could have used a strong editor 3. It contained a lot of nerdy Mag Fields facts

Now I know that Stephin Merritt instructed the rest of the band that "It's A Crime" was recorded with the phrase "Swedish reggae" constantly in mind, and that there's a staggering number of statistics web-sites available solely built because some listeners of "69 Love Songs" were...a little _too_ interested.

End result: cool for music trivia trainspotters like myself, but extremely demanding considering Beghtol's pretentious style of writing and collating stats.

Thanks to Frederic, I've discovered [AutoStitch](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mbrown/autostitch/autostitch.html). It's a program enabling the user to take panoramic pictures. From the page:

> AutoStitch is the world's first fully automatic 2D image stitcher. Capable of stitching full view panoramas without any user input whatsoever, AutoStitch is a breakthrough technology for panoramic photography, VR and visualisation applications.

Check out a little example I just made, [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-05-12-pano.jpg). The reason the picture's fuqdup is because I managed to take a few pictures of white walls. Hence, the program doesn't know how to stitch those parts together with the rest.

Try it yourself! Fun.

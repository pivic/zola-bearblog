**The up**

[Brian Chippendale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Chippendale) of Lightning Bolt [will use his supreme percussion-skills on Bj√∂rk's forthcoming album](http://bjork.com/news/?id=602;year=2007). Please, release it soon. I've pretty much worn out every bit of LB's recorded stuff that I've found, including vinyl-only and bootleg stuff.

**The down**

My driving-instructor is quitting his job where I live in order to go teach in another part of town. Bollocks! I'll have really high hopes for the new guy, if he's to live up to my very demanding expectations ((Meaning: try and stop me from killing you and myself before I wrap your expensive car around the nearest bend.)).

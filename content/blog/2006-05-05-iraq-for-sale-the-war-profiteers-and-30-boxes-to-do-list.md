![Courtesy of Jim Gilliam.](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-05-05-therm_explode.gif)I'm very happy for [Robert Greenwald](http://www.robertgreenwald.org) and his likes for getting more than [350,000USD collected in 8 days](http://www.jimgilliam.com/2006/05/iraq_for_sale_fundraising_a_total_blowout.php), from a lot of generous individuals who care for having sane things said. That said, "[Iraq For Sale: The War Profiteers](http://iraqforsale.org)" can become reality. Go visit the site, see the trailer.

[30 Boxes](http://30boxes.com), my favourite online-calendar, has now added [a to-do list](http://30boxes.com/blog/index.php/2006/05/04/30-boxes-adds-taggable-to-do-lists-for-gtd) per user. It behaves in a very good way, so go read more about it. [Here](http://static.flickr.com/51/140500010_6ed01f3cdc_o.jpg "It even lets you in on Yahoo! Calendar and gCal.")'s a picture of the user-interface, and do note that it lets you convert a 30 Boxes to-do-item to [Yahoo! Calendar](http://calendar.yahoo.com) and/or [gCal](http://calendar.google.com)!

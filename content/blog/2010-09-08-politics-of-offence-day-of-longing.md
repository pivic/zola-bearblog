The Swedish election is drawing close and all parties try to make themselves shine by slandering the other parties/the opposing political block. This is all becoming very American; today there are only two big political blocks, left and right.

En route to work today I was accosted by two political propagandists trying to sway me by being offensive. I told one of them to move out of my way as he was blocking my way, literally; he didn't reply other than by holding out a flyer towards me. I repeated what I said and then told him, again, to move out of my way. He did. I'm not voting for your party, fucker.

Then idiot #2! As I arrived in Liljeholmen, I found myself thwarted by a sucker who _pushed a flyer into my chest_. I asked him if he knew what he was doing, to which he just didn't reply. I walked past him and angrily walked to work.

Utter bastard. Needless to say, that party isn't getting my vote either.

Of course, the parties can't be held fully responsible for what their representatives do, but I'm sick of their vile propaganda. And I wouldn't have voted for either party even if tomorrow had never happened.

So what else? Loads of work. Tomorrow I'm working in the evening. This week has been nothing but hard labour during work-hours. What? _Doing actual work during work-hours?_

I wish I were home right now, making cheesecake. E-mailing Texan friends. Dawdling. Watching the second season of "The Restaurant". Whipping Petting Blixa. Caring for my wife. My _wife_. I like how that sounds rolling off my tongue, through the keyboard.

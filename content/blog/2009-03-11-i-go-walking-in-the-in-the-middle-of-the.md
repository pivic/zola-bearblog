[![Being held awake through night by this loveable, unfurry, dem... on TwitPic](http://twitpic.com/show/thumb/1ztxf.jpg)](http://twitpic.com/1ztxf "Being held awake through night by this loveable, unfurry, dem... on TwitPic")It's the middle of the night and X is sleeping. Lotta isn't, of course. It's the middle of the night, nobody is logged into Facebook and I'm waiting for the hours to reach some sort of humane level so that I can practice ashtanga yoga without disturbing the neighbours. The upstairs neighbour is awake though. I can hear him walking about, same routine as always, seemingly peeing into a bucket that must be connected to an amplifier by means of a microphone. Very "[Pacific Heights](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100318/)".

Speaking of otherworldly ongoings, Zak and I had a Twitter conversation yesterday that spanned [remarkable tour behaviour](http://twitter.com/Zakdaddy/status/1307471177) and [other guilty pleasures](http://twitter.com/pivic/status/1307539968). X and I are DJing at Nada Bar & Restaurant again, on the 24th of March this time, so go put that in your calendars. I'll write more about it later, but in the mean-time, [here](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=136324535156)'s the Facebook event and [here](http://www.last.fm/event/974349)'s the last.fm-event.

Yesterday evening was spent in calmness. A lot of music was played at home, which is quite rare being us. Britney's "_Stronger_" is truly one of the best pop songs she's ever sung. And Alison Moyet's "_Is This Love?_" should be heralded more often. Other tracks that deserve more attention is Barbara Morgenstern's "_The Operator_" - in my mind one of the best constructed pop songs in past years - Manic Street Preachers' "_Motorcycle Emptiness_", which I now feel I can fully listen to, having been absolutely bombarded with it throughout its heyday on MTV when it first hit, Eminem's "_Guilty Conscience_", a-ha's "_Take On Me_" ((Which funnily enough made me [wikipedia it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_on_Me), and then find [the lead actress on MySpace](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=174488055).)), Buzzcocks' "_You Say You Don't Love Me_", The Only Ones' "_Another Girl, Another Planet_", The Vines' "_Factory_" and Iggy Pop's "_Nightclubbing_".

Now I'm getting a bit tired, Lotta's gone to sleep and my alarm is set to go off in one minute.

OK, I'm mad. But I know it.

I've filmed the walk from my [where I approximately live](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=59.276635%2C18.127406&hl=en&z=11&ie=UTF8) to the subway station into a train to give you a jumpy view of what I experience nearly every week-day morning.

I'm the type of person who really freezes when I'm outdoors in below-zero (Celsius) degrees. Although my hands are cold almost constantly except during the summer (and I hate that fact) I can't stand it when my ears, face and shoulders reach a Kelvin. But music does help. And, once you're in the warm, receiving links like [this one](http://i49.tinypic.com/ehus4.jpg).

Now it's time to go home. I don't fear the cold because I know where I'm going there's love and the warmest arms ever to sink into.

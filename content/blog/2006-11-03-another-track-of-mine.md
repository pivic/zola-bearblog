Inspired by [Vini Reilly](http://www.column.freeuk.com/pages/vini.htm) and, obviously, the start of The Stone Roses' "[Made Of Stone](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses/_/Made+of+Stone)", I quickly composed and recorded this miniature track by recording and overdubbing two guitar-tracks using GarageBand, my old Les Paul-bootleg and a Line6 pod_XT_, so here you go. Please do leave a comment if you like.

**edit**: I've created a narcissistic page for my own audible rants [at last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Niklas+Pivic).

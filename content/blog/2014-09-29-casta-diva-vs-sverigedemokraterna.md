The aria named "Casta diva" from the first act of "[Norma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_(opera))" by [Bellini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Bellini) sprung to my head today, as the xenophobic, homophobic and hate-filled party named sverigedemokraterna just nominated Björn Söder as their second vice speaker for the Swedish parliament. He is [known for being a nationalist, hating Romanis, equating homosexuality with bestiality, hanging out with an SS officer](http://www.interasistmen.se/granskning/det-har-ar-sveriges-andre-vice-talman-en-rasist-och-homofob-av-rang), and will represent the party in their highest echelon, as before. Said party has time and time again stated that they will discredit and throw members of their party out if they should make racist, homophobic or extreme remarks; clearly, this is not the case, which has been proven over and over again, as plenty of their party top have been exculpated, e.g. during "[järnrörsskandalen](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A4rnr%C3%B6rsskandalen)".

Here's the lyrics from "Casta diva", both in the original language and translated to English (by Stefano Olcese):

I believe the reason for thinking of this aria as I heard of Söder becoming chosen as second vice speaker, is because the lyrics point out that one should be patient and not charge ahead without reason; [this page](http://classicalmusic.about.com/od/classicalmusictips/qt/Casta-Diva-Lyrics-And-Text-Translation.htm) explains this further in detail:

> \[...\] the high priestess Norma is visited by a group of angry Druids. They beseech her to declare war on Rome, whose soldiers occupy the Druids’ land and oppress their citizens. Norma assuages their fury and convinces them that now is not the time to fight. If patient, the Romans will fall by their own doing; an intervention is not necessary.

Even though I believe that we should fight sverigedemokraterna as much as possible, as it's basically a xenophobic, hate-filled party, I believe that we should do it compassionately. The near-13% who voted for sverigedemokraterna aren't evil, but I think the party, seen as an entity, is; if sverigedemokraterna were a person, it would be in jail by this time, sentenced for a plethora of hate-related crimes.

Here's Maria Callas' version of "Casta diva":

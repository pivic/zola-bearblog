He didn't exactly surprise us [like he did last time](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=207), but then again, this is the TV making the noises, not his alarming morning clock.

I am referring to our upstairs neighbour. This time, thanks to our sublime detective skills, we found he has fallen asleep with an hour's worth of video and very loud audio from the Stockholm Jazz Festival. Free-form jazz can be something very irritating, methinks, and hence as I write this, my eyes barely move and I'd love to be able to just fall asleep in this very chair, but I know the bloody jazz piece continues for a f-ing 18 minutes more, so I'll just fill you in with details on what's happened today, alright? It takes a maniac jazz fanatic to make me write!

Today I visited Jam, where I bought my guitar stuff this weekend. The man who serviced me was very helpful, yet a little bit doubtful. How come my sound-card had become kaput when no others had? Luckily, a guy from the factory that makes the actual sound-cards were visiting, saw my card, laughed and told me "computers are computers" and ran away with the card, eager to try it on some poor computer. Good luck, friend. I managed to get full refunds for the card and also for the guitar effect pedal, so now I'm actually on the prowl for something better than that pedal: a [Line6 Pod XT](http://www.line6.com/podxt).

Ain't it a beauty? Check out the features; jacking it into the computer by USB, one will be able to create one's own tones through a program. It's filled with loads of amps, mics et.c. which will cover all my needs. As Line6 are pushing for new products, they've lowered their prices. Har har, I hope I'll get one cheap.

NOW the neighbour has apparently shut his TV off. Thank Bog. Now sleep.

From Will himself:

> I wanted to make a short film to dramatize the song and pay homage to children's science fiction and fantasy adventure films like “The Goonies,” and “E.T.” that influenced me as a child. "Down Down The Deep River" takes place in various locations around my hometown in Meriden, New Hampshire, including my former elementary school, the woods near my childhood home, and the hills that overlook the town. These specific locales anchor the depiction of a small New Hampshire town that has seen little change since the 1980s.

Go to [the Kickstarter page](http://kck.st/IYuRZc) and back the fuck up - not as Onyx meant - but shill for the thrill!

If you're unfamiliar with [Okkervil River](http://okkervilriver.com), familiarise yourself, for the love of Bog. Here's X's great Spotify playlist for people who want to get to know OR:

Also, here's their latest album, through which the film is saturated:

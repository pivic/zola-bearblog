I'm going to buy a photo printer, and from what I've seen, [PictureMate Deluxe Viewer from Epson](http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&oid=53540922) seems to be the best choice right now. There's a quite good review of it [here](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1818969,00.asp). I've found reviews of other types and brands of photo printers [here](http://www.pcmag.com/category2/0,1738,1639086,00.asp), so tell me, for the love of Bog, if I'm making a wrong choice going for the Epson.

Micke came by yesterday and ate with us, which was nice. A tagliatelle pasta dish mixed with feta cheese, a salad and a few slivers of walnut bread courtesy of [Salt√•](http://www.saltakvarn.se) made the meal very nice.

Oh, if you wanna do something really stupid, just auction off your forehead to be tattooed like [this lady](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/06/30/national/a064000D81.DTL) did.

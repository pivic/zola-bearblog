In the war between search engines and different innovations in this field, Google now releases a beta of their coming "[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com)". From their press release:

> Google Scholar enables you to search specifically for scholarly literature, including peer-reviewed papers, theses, books, preprints, abstracts and technical reports from all broad areas of research. Use Google Scholar to find articles from a wide variety of academic publishers, professional societies, preprint repositories and universities, as well as scholarly articles available across the web.

It certainly looks like a good thing. Read more about it and how to contribute, [here](http://scholar.google.com/scholar/about.html).

Yesterday I called the landlord (Stockholmshem) to inform them that the bathroom drain is clogged and flooding. Wonderful! So I stayed at home this morning and waited for them to arrive.

They did, promptly and behaved very professionally. The first thing they did was to unlock a simple plug in the drain, where they found a toy mouse.

**A. Toy. Mouse.**

My heart stopped a little. So yes, it had clogged the drain.

But still - while the culprit stayed locked in the bedroom meowing away, wanting to see what all the excitement was about - there was something clogging the drain, after a lot of cleaning had been done.

An electric sewage-remover was yanked into our apartment, plugged-in and running. Sounded like a freaking power-drill but it did its job! And guess what was found?

**Another. Toy. Mouse.**

Yes! I needed those full stops for dramatic effect yet again!

I felt like an idiot. Still, the service-person was really nice and kind about it all, very "you pay your rent, so you're entitled to service". Hrmph.

I punished Blixa by letting her out from the bedroom and serving her food. Served her right. She then posed for me in the above pic.

**Bonus kitty-pic!**

En route to the subway station I met Svarten, or rather, a cat that X and I have named Svarten. Here he/she is:

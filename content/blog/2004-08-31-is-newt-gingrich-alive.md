Media Matters report on stuff from the now on-going republican convention in the USA. Among other stuff, Gingrich has recently stated that "[George Soros wants to spend $75 million defeating George W. Bush because Soros wants to legalize heroin](http://mediamatters.org/items/200408310010)". Of course, Fox is in on that as well.

Do they share [the same memos](http://www.wonkette.com/archives/fox-news-memos-the-whole-batch-017613.php) every morning?

The plot does not thicken. It's just evident, now boring and at the same time life-threatening. I know thinking people see through this torrent of pus as an insult of all intelligence, yet as it is never-ending, people need to see the truth in all of this. I'll never get tired of hearing the truth, no matter how boring or non-aggressive it may appear to be, as opposed to propaganda from the well-paid lobbyists of smeg trying to bash out lies through Fox, conservative media, the right-winged, christian fundamentalist garbage, et.c.

Why do I care so much about US politics? Because there is no other country that has a government that carries so much bad power and bad will at the moment. The US government has molded the USA into a singular [rogue state](http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/articles/z9804-rogue.html), where the current president isn't elected, but firmly placed there through a coup d'Ã©tat, where the rich get richer and the poor die despite what ads for George W. Bush's administration say.

My zeal for this will never die. I don't care what people think; should somebody say I'm an idiot for thinking these things, they're either with Dubya or not thinking at all. Probably both. :)

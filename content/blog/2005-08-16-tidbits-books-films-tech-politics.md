I've just received "[Catholic No.1](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=niklasblog-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/1933045159)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)", that turned out brilliant. It's a great hommage to cats, in all ways. It's an anthology where loads of artists got to do their spin on what cats are, their nature, their love - and in some cases, their dislike or hatred for them - in any way that's printable. Terry Richardson's cat portrait of Bruce LaBruce is great, as is a "cats in review" article, where an author grades his cats. I don't regret buying this in the least. [Here](http://www.eviltwinpublications.com/CATHOLIC2_1.html) you'll find a few sample pages, among which you have works by Richard Kern, so beware, it's not all work-safe, depending on what you do for a living, d'accord. I love typing the link to a page just before writing it may be non-work-safe, as most people really have to learn that it is almost always obligatory not to take anything out of its context. That's fuzzy logic for you.

I also discovered that [Fantagraphics](http://www.fantagraphics.com), the company that publishes most of what [the Hernandez brothers](http://www.fantagraphics.com/artist/losbros/losbros.html) have to offer in the world of comics, has now posted guides on how to venture forth in the brothers' respective universes. A while back [I wrote about the anthology](https://niklasblog.com/?p=567) "[Locas](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=niklasblog-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/156097611X)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)", which I ordered a while back and am impatiently waiting for. Thanks to the riches of the comics library of my old home-town, I read loads of books by the brothers. Their style of drawing and writing is quite different; I daresay Jaime aims for a more everyday style while Gilbert goes for a more epic approach. Even so, their stories often end up reaching the very same high levels where art can reach at its best. Even though Gilbert's stories of the inhabitants of Palomar captivate, thrill and shock most people (including myself), I really fell in love with Jaime's way of drawing and telling the stories about his characters, mostly Maggie and Hopey, whose adventures are almost captured in their entirety (this far) in "Locas". Gilbert came first, though, as "[Palomar](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=niklasblog-20&creative=9325&path=ASIN/1560975393)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)" was published in 2003, encompassing almost all he's drawn (that far) about...you guessed it.

So, Fantagraphics has posted guides on how to read on after one's bought the big books: [here](http://www.fantagraphics.com/blog/archive/2005_08_01_fantagraphics_archive.html#112380249335003546)'s the one to Jaime's world, and [here](http://www.fantagraphics.com/blog/archive/2005_08_01_fantagraphics_archive.html#112380494268199846)'s the one to Gilbert's. And don't come commenting on how you've ruined yourselves buying these effing great works of art after you do. Moaha!

Speaking of comics, it's now officially acknowledged that Frank Miller's comic "[300](http://www.night-flight.com/fmiller/fmiller300.html)" will become film. No new films, people, just remakes. Or - wait! Two films about the American 2001-09-11-disasters are being made, one starring Nicholas Cage who is trapped under one of the buildings with a partner, and the other about how the passengers of the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania stopped the plane from going into something more than ground. I just hope they don't mix in a lot of Wagner-esque music with an extremely nationalistic feel to it.

So, what's next in my becoming more materialistic? I won't go on about audio-players, but I've got my eye on a lens or two. First up is [this](http://tamron.com/lenses/prod/18200_diII.asp) Tamron lens: AF18-200MM F/3.5-6.3 XR Di II. It's a bit pricey for me, so I think I'll just go half that price and settle for [this](http://www.nikonusa.com/template.php?cat=1&grp=5&productNr=1928) Nikon lens: 70-300mm f/4-5.6G AF Zoom-Nikkor. We'll see. That's in the future. Besides, then I'll have to buy a new bag to carry around my stuff in. I'm thinking about [this Lowepro bag](http://lowepro.com/Products/Backpacks/allWeather/CompuTrekker_AW.aspx), as I was inspired by [this picture](http://wvs.topleftpixel.com/archives/misc_entries/050813_1281.shtml) of a good photographer's kit.

As the Sony PSP is slowly making its way to Sweden, I wonder if the [Gizmondo](http://www.gizmondo.com) will as well. It's got a built-in GPS, which I'll prefer to the built-in WiFi of the PSP, but what the heck, am I a gamer?

I am. But I don't game that often. One game that recently caught my eye is [Fahrenheit](http://www.fahrenheitgame.com) (which may be changing name to "Indigo Prophecy", hopefully to avoid confusion with [one of the most foul scents](http://www.escentual.co.uk/christian_dior/fahrenheit.html) in the known world), in which the player gets a film noir-feel à¡ la Max Payne, but is allowed to make a lot of interesting choices. The user interface is extremely minimal, which adds to the cinematic feel of the game. I just hope the story-line plods along in a great way; I'm a fan of games in which you kill-kill-kill-get-killed-restart-and-so-forth, but if the main thing should be a great story and isn't, I'll just quit playing.

Microsoft seems intent on kicking its "Photoshop killer" onwards. It's called Acrylic, and has received a few more functions and fixes this month, so download it if you're a fan of graphic-handling software. [Here](http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/whatsnew.aspx)'s what's new in the latest release.

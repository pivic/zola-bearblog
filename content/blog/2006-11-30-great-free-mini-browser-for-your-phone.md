If your mobile phone supports java, you can probably run [Opera Mini](http://www.operamini.com) on it. Just plod to that page, enter your mobile phone number, get the SMS and click on the URL. There you go, and you'll have Opera Mini installed in no time. Or download it [another way](http://www.operamini.com/download).

It's got built-in functionality for Wikipedia search, Google search, [RSS feeds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)) and secure connections. And you can of course anywhere you want. Duh.

**[The Avalanches](http://theavalanches.com/)** release their new album today. It's named _[We Will Always Love You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avalanches#2020:_We_Will_Always_Love_You)_ and is—as usual with these guys—a mixture of hippyism, great electronics, samples, acoustic guitars, Hawaii instrumentation, arrangements from everywhere, and great collaborators.

As I was listening to the album I heard a female voice softly reading these lyrics:

> The light of my life is going out tonight  
> In a pink champagne Corvette  
> The light of my life is going out tonight  
> Without a flicker of regret  
> Without a flicker of regret
> 
> Purple Mountains, _[Darkness and Cold](https://genius.com/Purple-mountains-darkness-and-cold-lyrics)_

The lyrics are a remix of Purple Mountains's _[Darkness and Cold](https://genius.com/Purple-mountains-darkness-and-cold-lyrics)_, which is a song off their eponymous album, which is [the best album of 2019](https://niklasblog.com/?p=23909) to me.

Karen O from Yeah Yeah Yeahs reads the lyrics.

I just fell apart on hearing that track. I'm somehow still mourning David. Just like I will always mourn [Travis](https://niklasblog.com/?p=24636), I guess.

After that track, _Running Red Lights_ came on. As the image in this post says, it's about loss. And what would be more apt at this point in time?

If you want to read an example of how supportive and kind David was, just [check this letter out](https://niklasblog.com/?p=23633).

Oh yeah, the entire The Avalanches album is lovely, by the way. I mean, imagine MGMT and Johnny Marr together with The Avalanches on one track. It's there! And Leon Bridges, Neneh Cherry, and other lovely collaborators. It's love.

[![The Unwritten, Vol. 5: On to Genesis](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1327959829m/12132930.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12132930) [The Unwritten, Vol. 5: On to Genesis](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12132930) by [Mike Carey](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9018)  
My rating: [3 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/231019944)  
  
The fifth installment in the story of Tommy Taylor, a main character with some magic skills and quite a few similarities to Harry Potter.

In this book, he goes forth with his friends through the epic tale that is The Unwritten, this time touching with the 1950s, his father's old belongings and The Tinker, a comic which turns out to have more with himself to do than he bargained for.

Started out slow but caught pace in the middle. Finished quite fairly, and I'm looking forward to read the sixth installment, even though I'm worried that it's been lacking strength of late.

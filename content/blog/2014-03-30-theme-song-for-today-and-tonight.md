It's [Richard Hawley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hawley)'s "_Tonight The Streets Are Ours_".

Even though I think that song is liberating and loving, it also reminds me of two other things: Atari Teenage Riot's "[_Destroy 2000 Years Of Culture_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bivsP_h6l0s)" and [Weather Underground](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground) ((Don't miss [the documentary](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343168) on this group.)).

The weather's brilliant here in Stockholm. Crime day. Oh, indeed.

[![red maloo kimono bag](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-08-04-macbookbag.jpg)](http://www.redmaloo.com/index_f.php)Even though I'm going to purchase a [booq Mamba S](http://www.booq.de/Detail.bok?no=434) for my MacBook, I must say I like the sleeves that [red maloo](http://www.redmaloo.com/index_f.php) push out, even though their kimono laptop sleeves are the best; I think they're actually the best-looking ones I've seen, the catch being they're available in Japan only.

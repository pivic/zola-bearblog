People might say he knew how to party, but I feel sad for the guy. [Here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3665026.stm)'s a BBC article on the thang, but Rick still lives on in our hearts. Cursed be the fools who think he was just a pathetic moron that Dave Chappelle hailed! Go get a Rick James greatest hits and feel elevated. Bitches, it's a celebration.

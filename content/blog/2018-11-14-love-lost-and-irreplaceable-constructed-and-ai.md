The below is the latest episode to "**You, Me and the Big C**", which is a podcast where three persons have spoken about their cancer; at the start of the series, one of them had recently been declared to be free from cancer; as free as one can get at the moment, at any rate.

However, not that long ago, Rachael Bland, one of the members of the show, died.

The episode above is gut-wrenching, especially when her husband talks of how their three-year-old son reacted to his mother's death:

A really heavy episode to listen to, overall. Still, it provided me with some kind of delivery on how the future might be. Also, it reminded me that some people have a lot more hardship to deal with than myself (naturally).

After that, I listened to the latest episode of "**This is Love**", the podcast by the makers of "**Criminal**", a podcast that I regularly listen to.

This episode, "_How to Live Forever_", deals with how artificial intelligence has come so far that a couple of individuals have created a robot that is a replica of an actual, living individual. It's named [BINA48](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BINA48).

Phoebe Judge, the host of the podcast, seemingly flinches at how alike the human being and the robot are, down to finickity details like movement, tone, inflection, and pauses.

Some people have built chatbots to kind of..._[simulate](https://qz.com/1367185/could-ai-allow-you-to-live-forever/)_ dead friends.

I don't think I'll ever be intrigued with being emulated by a machine.

Where the survivors in "You, Me and the Big C" speak about the importance of leaving behind some kind of legacy, to one's children in particular, they mention written books, notes to be read at specific ages, times, or in places. It's something to be treasured. Monologues.

I don't think I ever want to talk with a replica of my wife. Never, ever. The first word that comes to mind is "disgraceful"; however, this is just what I think and feel. If it helps others or just feels like a good thing, that's what it is: good.

I don't think we can be universal about this. While I am aware that I will soon probably have my conversation with a robot without realising it actually is one—if that's not happened to me already—it's alright if it's making an appointment somewhere. But I'd be completely horrified if somebody had kind of synthesized a replica of my wife; as if that would be possible. I often joke that it's not possible to clone her, so...no chatbot will ever manage to replace her.

I start thinking about what Freddie, the three-year-old child, said: "Daddy, don't worry, it's just us two now. It'll be OK."

I don't know what I'd do at that point.

A robot may as well do a great job in replacing me as I'd be a wreck at that point. But, considering you have a child, you don't stop.

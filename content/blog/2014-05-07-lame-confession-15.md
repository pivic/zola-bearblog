When I was a kid I wanted a lot of keys on my keyring as I thought that would make me look cool. The older boys had a lot of keys that rustled as they tugged them out of their pockets, preferably attached to a metal keychain.

I thought that having a lot of keys somehow meant that you were more important, trustworthy and cool. And of course you could try and use your key+keychain like Bruce Lee in front of your friends while casually talking, which would be extra fierce.

Once I'd obtained enough keys to make my keyring look like a ninja star on steroids I no longer thought I looked cool, but had created something that just turned out to ruin all of my pockets.

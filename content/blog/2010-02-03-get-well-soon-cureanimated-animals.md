No, I am not trying to find something that isn't there. Hence, I'm trying to venture into the calm and self-curing through music.

[Currently playing, in order](http://open.spotify.com/user/pivic/playlist/10JezHCQYndSk88pP3oWDg):

1\. Tindersticks - "_Piano Music_" 2. [Morrissey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey "Morrissey") - "_I Have Forgiven Jesus_" 3. The Jesus & Mary Chain - "_[April Skies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Skies "April Skies")_" 4. [Brian Eno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno "Brian Eno") - "_1/1_" 5. The Kills ““ "_At The Back Of The Shell_"

I feel like I'm Atreyu floating on top of Falcor in that calm way, even though Falcor smiled and closed his eyes while flying through the clouds in the night, following all that string music and the startling images of the Nothing moving further, of G'mork in the cave. That's how I'm left after hearing the track by Brian Eno.

And...I shouldn't be posting this due to the stupidity of it all but it weirdly, very weirdly, puts me back on track. A Sphynx that is evil. And a brief word from a Chinese Crested. And there's a slew of people from Saturday Night Live/30 Rock in there.

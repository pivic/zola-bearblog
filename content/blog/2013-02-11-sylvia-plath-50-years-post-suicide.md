Today marks 50 years since the death of [**Sylvia Plath**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Plath).

If you haven't read her, I can only recommend "[_The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath_](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5297)" and "[_Ariel_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_%28book%29)", the works of hers that I've read, and there's always the story of [her works as they were edited/destroyed by her husband, Ted Hughes](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5590). "_Ariel_" stands out as one of the best poetry books that I have ever read.

No, I haven't read "_The Bell Jar_", which is a probable slight.

A few recent articles about her:

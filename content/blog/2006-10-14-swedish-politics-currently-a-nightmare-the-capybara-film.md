[![Moi](http://static.flickr.com/118/269146248_c90a326659_m.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/269146248)So what's new in Sweden? Basically nothing, if you leave out some simple facts:

Most of the new ministers that make up the newly elected Swedish government are clowns; [Maria Borelius has just jumped ship](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6051220.stm) (she was trade minister) after admitting she's hired nannies without paying taxes and employers' fees plus not paid television license fees for years, which are two items that the newly appointed minister of culture (!), Cecilia Stegö Chilà², has done - although she's still in place. Tobias Billström, minister of migration, is also still in place in some very strange way, having paid no TV license and purchased private stuff using the governmental credit card. Sweet first week for the newly appointed conservative parties; can you tell [I'm liberal](http://www.threadless.com/product/628/Breaking_Up_Is_Hard_To_Do)? Still, Borelius might get [1.1 million Swedish Crowns for a week's work](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=145&a=580572). Not bad.

More about that in Swedish at [DN](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1042&a=580482&previousRenderType=1) and [SvD](http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_13858789.asp).

We have no [capybarii](http://www.exzooberance.com/virtual%20zoo/they%20walk/capybara/Capybara%20485055.jpg). I can't understand how come there are none in this blasted country, apart from the cold. Come live with me! This goes for [these bunnys](http://mfrost.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/bunnehs.jpg) as well. And [the disapproving rabbit](http://www.birdchick.com/adventures/rabbit/index3.html).

Time to [gimme a hand](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=352)! No, that's just "[Jigoku](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=352)", a horror-film that I'm looking forward to. And catch "[The Rules Of The Game](http://www.janusfilms.com/rulesofthegame/trailers.html)" whenever you have the chance; upstairs-downstairs drama has always been a nice hop from [kitchen-sink stuff](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054269), which I also love.

I like reading [this post about Travis](https://aquariumdrunkard.com/2020/04/13/when-a-drummer-falls-during-a-pandemic-does-he-make-a-noise-travis-nelsen-does/) that popped up yesterday.

From it:

> Gratitude made up the atmosphere surrounding Travis’s tornadic joy; he was always feeling lucky. “I’ll never forget hanging in the backyard in Brooklyn, him saying, ‘We’re drummers, man; we get paid to hit things!’” Recalls Bryan Devendorf of The National.  
>   
> As hard as he hit the drums was as hard as he could be on himself. “Like us all,” says Thor Harris, musician and ad-lib politician, “he had demons–anxiety, self-doubt, imposter syndrome, inner band strife. He learned to quiet them with booze. But when with Travis, the subtext was always: how fucking lucky are we to be driving around the country playing music for people every night?” And that’s how he approached each waking moment. Unhesitant to put his own faults on display, even laughing them into the spotlight, he would invite you and your best qualities up there with him. He allowed you to shine. “Thank god we squandered our youth with that dude,” says Thor, a sentiment echoed by many.

The article contains a music playlist made out of songs which Travis loved, according to some of his friends.

Here it is, both in its original Spotify form and in remade Tidal and Deezer playlists that I converted it to:

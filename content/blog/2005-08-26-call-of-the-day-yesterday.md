At 08:45 yesterday morning, a user called me. As it was Thursday and I carried the emergency phone, this is expected; the problem, however, was not at all expected.

me: IT-services, I am Niklas speaking, how may I help you? person: Hello! I'm X, and every time you make my computer update itself, I lose files. m: Sorry, do you mean you lose files that you have created, or does the system-- p: Exactly. m: ...what I meant to ask you, is whether you lose files you have created, or does-- p: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, the files are lost when you update my computer. m: What I meant to ask you, is whether you lose files you have created, or does the computer tell you that system files are missing, after an update? p: Well, the files I have created.

\[after checking whether or not the files had once actually existed in the proper location\]

m: So, exactly what happens when you receive notification that Windows-updates are available for the computer you're working at? p: Well, I click to install them, of course. m: Very well, and what do you do when they're installed. p: I choose to reboot the computer, of course. m: Have you closed all of your programs and systems before telling the computer to reboot? p: No; after I've pressed "reboot", I start closing my programs.

\[here a little discussion follows, where I explain that no matter how fast he is, the computer can still shut down programs before him, and even if he thinks he's saved said files, they may not be saved\]

m: So, you see, always shut down your programs before opting to reboot Windows. p: But the system should tell me that the work I've done won't be saved if I reboot. m: I understand you, but it won't; the system will reboot and not care whether or not you've saved your programs or not as they're not linked that way. p: But...I mean, many users should be afflicted by this! Haven't more called about this, today, even? m: No, actually I haven't spoken to a single user who has been afflicted by this problem. p: Oh. I understand. Do you think Microsoft will include a message about the dangers of all this, in the future? m: They will probably not, I think. p: Oh. Good-bye. m: Good-bye.

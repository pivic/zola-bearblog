Apart from the fact that most people I read books of, writers, they write their books by hand. No computers. Writing by hand brings forethought and allows for reflection while writing. Naturally, I've found that I write a lot faster using a fountain pen than by using a ballpoint pen, or a pencil. Yep, a longer gestation time, the more mind you spend changes the contents of what you're trying to convey.

In the above film, the main person's using a _Muji_ fountain pen and Noodler's ink, but just check around the 03:50 mark; I love how the [flex nib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_nibs) of the pen moves. Handwriting is personality. It's not _everything_ - content could matter - but beauty is beauty. I'm not one for calligraphy myself, but I do love [nib customisations](http://nibs.com/Fountain-Pen-Nib-Customizations.htm) that are available for that... Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming.

Knowledge is not isolationalism.

I've not stopped using Quora due to [this recent hack](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124849/quora-100-million-user-hack-name-email-messages), where about 100 million e-mail addresses, private e-mails, and other details were stolen, but due to other factors.

From [this excellent article](https://waxy.org/2018/12/why-you-should-never-ever-use-quora) about why one should stop using Quora:

\[perfectpullquote align="full"\]

Quora has:

- No public API.
- No backup or export tools.
- Restricted access to answers without an account.
- Blocked [scrapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) and unofficial APIs, and deleted questions related to scraping on their site.

Also, on a more wide scale, Quora blocks [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) from indexing their site. This means the data and the answers collected are only contained within Quora itself.

This is quite sickening behaviour for a site that claims to be on the side of people who want to know, especially as [the aforementioned article](https://waxy.org/2018/12/why-you-should-never-ever-use-quora) mentions that Quora wants Internet Archive to create an API where Quora can modify their data at any point—which shows not only that Quora wants to pervert the foundations for why Internet Archive exists in the first place, but how they are insistent on keeping their data to themselves.

If they open up an API where we can remove content from the archive when authors remove it from Quora, but leave the rest of the content archived, we would be happy to opt back in.

The day Quora shuts down, the information will be lost. I'm not going to be part of this, unless Quora changes.

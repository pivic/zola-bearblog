[Here](http://namco-ch.net/katamari_damacy_ps2/stage/index.php) you'll find screen-shots of Katamari Damacy 2, a very long-awaited game for the PS2 console indeed. Child-friendly? Yes. Addictive? Hell yes. Only that I've not completed a katamari which exceeds 10 cm's.

On that tip, check out the latest South Park-episode, titelled "Best Friends Forever". Here's a synopsis:

> This week, the town is sold out of the new portable gaming system, and Kenny has one but Cartman doesn't. Will their friendship survive?

It's the PSP, people. And Terri Schiavo is thrown in for good measure.

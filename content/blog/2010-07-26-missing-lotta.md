I used to have pangs of sadness hit me after Lotta passed away. I'm glad to say that now, I remember her as she was, rather than just being sad when I think of her. A few things come to mind:

Her soft, yet sometimes waxy skin. The way she tried to bully us away from food (especially pizza). How she moved and how her face looked as she jumped off the TV and grumpily came towards us. The feeling of waking up because of her jaws clasping around my nose in the middle of the night; the feelings of guilt as I wanted to kick her across the room for doing so, but ended up speaking to her in a soft voice, petting her as she purred. Watching her and Blixa trying to become friends ((I.e. getting used to the fact that they were doomed to living with each-other in a quite confined space.)). Her warm smell. The way she could make me inadvertently break-dance by walking just in front of my feet, wherever I'd try to turn. Her warmth. Seeing her carefully walk up to X's face and plant herself in X's throat, purring away.

Lotta is beyond missed and will forever be revered as much more than "just a cat". She is family.

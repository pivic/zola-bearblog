Even though I love “[Jackass](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264263)“, I must say “[Viva La Bam](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382501)“ is slightly worse. Well, Jackass was first, and I miss [Johnny Knoxville](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424216), although his film career is very sad.

As IMDb says, Viva La Bam concentrates on Bam Margera's attempts to ruin his parents' lives. I gather they're pretty content with this, as the cash probably flows in droves. Bam buys anything he wants, and practically does anything he wants, which sometimes, I think, crosses the border of the arrogant, destroying stuff worth thousands of dollars, just because he wants to agitate his parents. Well, it's a sick sight. I wish to Bog that his father would just sit on him for an hour or so, until it just stops being funny. If it ever does!

I have an ambivalent approach to the series, though. I love their antics. It's surprising to see them get up to all they do, as their imagination stretches. True, the stunts aren't as painful as in Jackass, but it's nevertheless very invigorating to see Bam get slapped the fuck out by his father, poor (yet wealthy) Phil, as seen in the picture above battling his brother to win the title of Fatass 2004.

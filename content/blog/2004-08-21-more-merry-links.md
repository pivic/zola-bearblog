[Here](http://www.qsleeper.com) is a grand way to make use of the fear in the USA, to make a lot of money. Apparently "protection from Bio-Chemical \[why is that in capital letters? What is the difference from "bio-chemical"?\] terrorist attack" and "protection from kidnappers/stalkers", the people who make the "Quantum Sleeper" should rest nine feet below ground. Anybody who uses fear to make money should perish. On the other hand, how does that render my occupation? Hm.

iPod or audio cassette? [Here](http://homepage.mac.com/danielturek/PhotoAlbum50.html) is the final test.

Don't miss out: [Black Pus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Pus) have released two entire albums for free download through [this page](http://www.fauxfetus.net/faux/bands/blackpus).

So, who are they? Black Pus is the brainchild of Brian Chippendale, one half of [Lightning Bolt](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1097). If listening, prepare for a wild ride.

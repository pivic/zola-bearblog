When I sat down in my office chair this morning, I nearly fell out of it. Why? One of the wheels gave way. Drat! I thought, but then noticed [the plastic that was supposed to hold the wheel was shattered](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-10-18-wheel.jpg), unable to hold the wheel. It was also held together with tape. Hmm. The plot thickens.

Then I noticed that one arm-recliner was also damaged beyond repair. [A plastic thing holding it up wasn't in place and the recliner had also been taped up](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-10-18-recliner.jpg)!

The persons responsible were called up for inspection, immediately recognised the error and said they would pay for a new chair, so I'm right now sitting and using a drab chair that induces back pains. Ow. Poor, pitiful me, indeed.

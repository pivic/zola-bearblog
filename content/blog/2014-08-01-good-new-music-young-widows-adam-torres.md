Please send me some tips. I'm looking for new music! Do comment on this post if you'd like to hand me some of your faves.

First up, **[Saint Clair](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Saint-Clair/323646491133100)** is none other than Michael Patrick St. Clair's solo vehicle; he's a musical maestro, multi-instrumentalist and radiant accomplice with bands such as **[Okkervil River](http://okkervilriver.com)** and **[The Polyphonic Spree](http://www.thepolyphonicspree.com)**. He's finally released his first solo track which you can check out right here:

Can't wait to hear more from Mike!

Thanks to him, by the way, I discovered **[Adam Torres](https://www.facebook.com/adamtorresmusic)** from [this article](http://www.wonderingsound.com/feature/keeping-music-secret-adam-torres):

I like that track a lot. It's on repeat over here, dazing me away. Reminds me some of Kurt Vile. For more of his music, [he's on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/adamtorres).

Another band I've just found is **[Grails](http://www.grailsongs.com)**. Their latest album, "_[Black Tar Prophecies Vol's 4, 5 & 6](http://shop.temporaryresidence.com/trr187)_", is wonderful. It combines strange stuff like 1970s prog and really experimental stuff that sounds like **Explosions In The Sky** and **Godspeed! You Black Emperor**. Here's a song that really grows and grows, and turns out different than the first couple of minutes:

An old Ministry of Sound DJ who is named **[DJ Harvey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Harvey)** has turned out to like boogie-psych rock, and this is what he churns out through his new outfit, **Wildest Dreams**. Here's a 5-minute sampler of the new album that sounds like it could be 40 years old (in a good way):

**[Young Widows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Widows)** is a band that reminds me of **...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead** and **Death From Above 1979**. It's ham-fisted music and not very melodic, but I need that stuff too, from time to time.

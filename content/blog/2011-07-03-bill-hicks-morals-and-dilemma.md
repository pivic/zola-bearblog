Bill Hicks on morals and some peoples' dilemmas regarding them.

> _Here_ is my final point. Oh thank you, God. About drugs, about alcohol, about pornography - whatever that is - what business is it of yours what I do, read, buy, see, or take into my body, as long as I do not harm another human being on this planet? And for those of you out there whore having a little moral dilemma in your head how to answer that question, I'll answer it for ya. _None_ of your fucking business! Take that to the bank, cash it and go fuckin' on a vacation out of my life. But see, here's their argument to that each and every time: 'But we have to protect the children, we have to protect the children.' Let me tell you something: children are smarter than any of us. You know how I know that? I don't know one child with a full-time job and children. Yeah. They're _quick_ these kids, man. They're fucking _quick_.

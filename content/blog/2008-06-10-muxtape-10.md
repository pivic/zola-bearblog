This time around, there's no theme, but great songs in my kinda order, and you'll play it [here](http://pivic.muxtape.com).

1\. **Jason Forrest** - "My Favourite 36 Punk Songs"

Mash-up galore, yet still coherent, Forrest proves he's utterly underestimated.

2\. **Beastie Boys** - "Sure Shot"

One of my fave hip-hop tracks, that I've actually karaoked to. Believe it or not!

3\. **Depeche Mode** - "A Question Of Lust"

It's been too long since last time, boys.

4\. **Okkervil River** - "O, Dana"

_I'd rather shoot a woman than a man_. I'd love to sing and semi-dance to this at sunset.

5\. **Roy Orbison** - "Crying"

One of my fave tears-tracks. It lives on despite the blatant weepiness, because it works. Orbison's voice was so frail and beautiful on this one.

> I was alright for a while, I could smile for a while. But when I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight as you stopped to say hello. And though you wished me well, you couldn't tell that I'd been crying over you, crying over you

6\. **Les Rhythmes Digitales** - "Take A Little Time"

Before Mr. Lu Cont started producing Madonna, this was what he was best known for. Brilliant, and [Shannon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_(singer)) is on guest vocals! Don't miss out on her "_[Let The Music Play](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpEGDXhu5oM)_".

7\. **The Cramps** - "Human Fly"

Bzz, bzz, bzzzz. Slow and low. Lux Interior knew how to sing.

8\. **Holy Fuck** - "Frenchy's"

Bombastic. I love this band, and [they're playing at Way Out West](http://wayoutwest.se/holy-fuck). Love it.

9\. **Cut Chemist** - "Alphabet Aerobics - Blackalicious (The Cut Chemist 2.5 Minute Workout)"

Before Jurassic 5 imploded, Cut Chemist was the DJ. This is one of many examples of how he can work a turntable.

10\. **Weezer** - "Troublemaker"

First track from their new album, and Rivers Cuomo still shows how he can turn out navel-gazing, all-singing-to-this autobiographies through pop.

11\. **James Brown** - "There Was A Time (Kenny Dope Remix)"

One half of [Masters At Work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_At_Work) and a famous DJ, Kenny Dope turns out this old track by James Brown as part of Verve's JB remix-album, adding more funk (if that's possible).

12\. **The Flaming Lips** - "Do You Realize??"

The lyrics are wonderful, and this is just a reverbian masterpiece.

> Do you realize - that you have the most beautiful face Do you realize - we're floating in space Do you realize - that happiness makes you cry Do you realize - that everyone you know someday will die

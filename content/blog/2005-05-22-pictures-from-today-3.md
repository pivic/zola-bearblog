Today Mikaela and I trotted to Mazzika, a caf√© near Frederic's apartment. We had something to eat and coffee. It was fun to meet Milka again as well, she always engages in conversation with an interesting mind. The sun was peeking through the clouds, but the first thing we noted was the temperature outside. One could sit wearing a t-shirt without getting cold. The air was lukewarm, and the coffee helped.

We stayed for an hour or so before heading home, where Mikaela made oven-grilled vegetables with bulgur, tzatsiki and hummus, all home-made, of course. Mikaela makes brilliant foods. I can always taste her "proof in the pudding", so to speak, a very special taste which speaks for her skill and ability to make her imprint on whatever she makes in the kitchen. This goes for what she does in a variety of ways, of course!

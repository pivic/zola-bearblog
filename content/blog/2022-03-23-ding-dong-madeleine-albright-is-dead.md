Madeleine Albright.

Madeleine Albright, the former U.S. Secretary of State and diplomat, has died. Finally. I mean this as a symbol.

Being a diplomat for the USA must be like trying to have children by anal sex: you can try, but the purpose is defeated from the start. Another analogy (no pun intended) is that any inflicted pain is on the behalf of the recipient, none for the giver.

Here's a tribute quote that I read:

> 'My mindset is Munich,' she said frequently, referring to the German city where the Western allies abandoned her homeland to the Nazis." Madeleine Albright, the first female US secretary of state, dies at 84. Albright's most recent book could not be more on point. 'Fascism: A Warning.'

I answered Dave:

> Hi!  
>   
> Let's not forget other juicy facts about Albright, for example, how she deemed the lives of half a million Iraqi children to be expendable, as long as the USA could prolong its illegal war-crime invasion of Iraq.  
>   
> I remember my family being bombed by NATO in cahoots with the USA - another war crime, by the way, for which the USA (nor NATO) were never tried in international court, in spite of this being in flagrant breach of international law - and how this was also celebrated through American media. North American mainstream media, I should say. South American media sources know very well what being ruined by the USA feels like. Credible North American news sources, such as Z Magazine, weren't tolerated. CNN didn't broadcast how the US murdered children but instead decided to focus on other things.  
>   
> Albright lived on, while the USA devastated and razed Iraq and other countries.  
>   
> And so, legions of war crimes for which US politicians will never be tried also live on, in infamy.

On May 12, 1996, Albright defended UN sanctions against Iraq on a 60 Minutes segment in which Lesley Stahl asked her, "We have heard that half a million children have died. I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?" and Albright replied, "We think the price is worth it."

This is the legacy of Madeleine Albright, the person who didn't like what she called '[disgusting Serbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Albright#Allegations_of_hate_speech_against_Serbs_and_war_profiteering)'.

Remember, if the USA hung on to the post-WW2 war-crimes laws that they fashioned for the rest of the world in Nuremberg, every American president since would be hung until dead for their war crimes.

Sad and true.

![Chromeo](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-07-24-chromeo.jpg)The first time I heard of [Chromeo](http://www.chromeo.net) was in [this article in The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguide/features/story/0,,2119355,00.html), where they talk about the best funk ever. Their references look so good and since The Guardian wrote that "the Montreal duo's new album Fancy Footwork is more 1980s than Molly Ringwald, Frogger and flogging arms to Iran", well, I had to look them up.

Sho nuff, their album "[Fancy Footwork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Chromeo_Fancy_Footwork.jpg)" is about as 80's as you can get ((Although Les Rhythmes Digitales "Darkdancer" is even more 80's in my opinion, even though Chromeo's new album is funkier.)) and if [Roger Troutman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Troutman) had a child with [Giorgio Moroder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Moroder), it would be named Chromeo. Vintage synths, riffs, vocoder-laden vocals and [Morris Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Day) all wrapped into one.

Here's "[Tenderoni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenderoni)", a track from their new album. As usual, the track will be but a memory after a week. The track is once again up, thanks to last.fm!

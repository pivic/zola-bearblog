![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-01-13-gato.gif)At work we have a little system designed to notify us whenever an anti-virus application is triggered by a virus or spyware trying to execute. Today I looked at a victim's computer screen and found [the following big-assed cat](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-01-13-biggato.gif). Whassup, uglycat! Scared me more than if there had been big pornographic pictures plastered across the screen, in a twisted way.

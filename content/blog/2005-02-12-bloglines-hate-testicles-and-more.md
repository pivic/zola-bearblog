First, I've found [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com). It's a free service to help you sort your news. Check info on exactly what it is [here](http://www.bloglines.com/help/faq#What), then check out the little nasty Bloglines banner I've incorporated in the right-hand frame of this blog, allowing you to easily add it to your Bloglines account. Of course, this means I'm raiding more than one blog at a time, letting me rape other people's material to post it here. Well, eh, not really. Maybe. Aw, what the hell, here's the news:

Peter Bagge, long-time comic artist, is finally starting to release his "Hate", collected as a series of books. The first one is soon available, and at 10USD for 340 pages of hate, it's good. Click [here](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1560976233) to get to the Amazon page. Not that I endorse Amazon, but I haven't been able to find it cheaper, even at [Bokfynd](http://www.bokfynd.nu), a Swedish site that helps you to find the cheapest place to get your books from. I tipped them about the ISBN number though, so we'll see who's the cheapest.

Got [this URL](http://www.thisislondon.com/news/articles/16449119?source=PA) from Dennis, which shows what some people (under medication and alcohol) can do for the team they love.

I must say I love [this](http://chromogenic.net/archives/000802.html) picture of the day off CHROMOGENIC, a very nice photo blog. URL constantly available in the right-hand side of this blog.

Soon the Nintendo DS will hit the world at large. It's a new game platform which people seem to like (even though I'm betting my money on the [Playstation Portable](http://www.digitalbackspin.com/adm/templates/generic-review-tmp.asp?articleid=1636&zoneid=21)) and [here](http://auby.no/dill/tetris.jpg)'s a picture of a mod somebody has done; a guy has ported his own Tetris clone into the Nintendo DS. That's nerd for you.

Oh, and if you, too, hate the commercial spectacle that is "valentine's day", check out [these coupons](http://www.theonion.com/news/index.php?issue=4106&n=9) from The Onion.

## Medium sees more employee exits after CEO publishes ‘culture memo’

> This seems like another in a series of bad managerial decisions by technology culprits:
> 
> In April, Medium CEO Ev Williams wrote a memo to his staff about the company’s shifting culture in the wake of a challenging year.
> 
> “A healthy culture brings out the best in people,” he wrote. “They feel psychologically safe voicing their ideas and engaging in debate to find the best answer to any question — knowing that their coworkers are assuming good intent and giving them the benefit of the doubt because they give that in return.”
> 
> A few paragraphs later, Williams wrote that while counterperspectives and unpopular opinions are “always encouraged” to help make decisions, “repeated interactions that are nonconstructive, cast doubt, assume bad intent, make unsubstantiated accusations, or otherwise do not contribute to a positive environment have a massive negative impact on the team and working environment.”
> 
> He added: “These behaviors are not tolerated.”

## Microsoft says error led to no matching Bing images for Tiananmen ‘tank man’ Microsoft censored 'tank man' and so did DuckDuckGo:

> Microsoft Corp on Friday blamed “accidental human error” for its Bing search engine not showing image results for the query “tank man” in the United States and elsewhere after users raised concerns about possible censorship around the Tiananmen Square crackdown anniversary.
> 
> Users, including in the United Kingdom, Germany and Singapore, reported Friday that when they performed the search Bing returned the message, "There are no results for tank man."
> 
> Smaller search engines such as DuckDuckGo that license results from Microsoft faced similar issues around "tank man" searches and said they expected a fix soon.

## Don Ho, the creator of popular freeware editor Notepad++ removes Bing as search engine because of their stance. His words:

> When a search engin does the censorship instead of its job, the search result loses its quality and it's not reliable anymore. Hence, Microsoft Bing is removed from Notepad++ for "Search on Internet" command.

## The Secret IRS Files: Trove of Never-Before-Seen Records Reveal How the Wealthiest Avoid Income Tax

> In 2007, Jeff Bezos, then a multibillionaire and now the world’s richest man, did not pay a penny in federal income taxes. He achieved the feat again in 2011. In 2018, Tesla founder Elon Musk, the second-richest person in the world, also paid no federal income taxes.
> 
> Michael Bloomberg managed to do the same in recent years. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn did it twice. George Soros paid no federal income tax three years in a row.
> 
> ProPublica has obtained a vast trove of Internal Revenue Service data on the tax returns of thousands of the nation’s wealthiest people, covering more than 15 years. The data provides an unprecedented look inside the financial lives of America’s titans, including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and Mark Zuckerberg. It shows not just their income and taxes, but also their investments, stock trades, gambling winnings and even the results of audits.
> 
> Taken together, it demolishes the cornerstone myth of the American tax system: that everyone pays their fair share and the richest Americans pay the most. The IRS records show that the wealthiest can — perfectly legally — pay income taxes that are only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions, if not billions, their fortunes grow each year.
> 
> Many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, amassing little wealth and paying the federal government a percentage of their income that rises if they earn more. In recent years, the median American household earned about $70,000 annually and paid 14% in federal taxes. The highest income tax rate, 37%, kicked in this year, for couples, on earnings above $628,300.
> 
> The confidential tax records obtained by ProPublica show that the ultrarich effectively sidestep this system.

There's also critique against ProPublica for their article: [this post](https://savingjournalism.substack.com/p/propublicas-bombshell-bullshit-tax) is written by a former ProPublica writer and [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27441277) you can find some interesting comments on that post.

Speaking of which:

> Microsoft Irish subsidiary paid zero corporate tax on £220bn profit last year
> 
> An Irish subsidiary of Microsoft made a profit of $315bn (£222bn) last year but paid no corporation tax, as it is “resident” for tax purposes in Bermuda.
> 
> The company, Microsoft Round Island One, posted profits last year roughly equal to nearly three-quarters of Ireland’s entire gross domestic product (GDP) – despite having zero employees.
> 
> The subsidiary, which collects licence fees for use of copyrighted Microsoft software around the world, recorded an annual profit of $314.7bn in the year to the end of June 2020, according to accounts filed at the Irish Companies Registration Office. Its profits jumped from just under $10bn the previous year and compare with Ireland’s 2020 GDP of €357bn ($437bn).

## Don't soak that pen!

For a long time, fountain-pen aficionados have heard that we should soak our pens for a while, in order to properly clean them out. This is not the case.

> It seems so logical: that old fountain pen won't come apart, so why not soak it in water to soften whatever is holding it together?
> 
> But in fact there are many reasons not to soak, ranging from ineffectiveness to the all too real possibility of irreversible damage. Pens may be made to hold liquid, but it doesn't necessarily follow that they were made to be submerged in it. Pen repair professionals resort to soaking very selectively. In those cases where soaking is done, the pen's materials and construction are positively identified and thoroughly understood beforehand, and the water exposure is held to a minimum in terms of both area and duration.
> 
> What can go wrong with soaking? Many pen materials can be harmed by even relatively short exposure to water. Most notable are casein-based plastics, which will swell, distort, and split (they will not, however, actually dissolve). Hard rubber (ebonite) will instantly fade if its surface has had any significant exposure to light over the years. Despite what many say, this fading doesn't require a prolonged soak: even spattered waterdrops will often do it. Celluloid is more water-resistant, but is still much more permeable than newer and harder plastics. Light-colored celluloids can stain if left soaking in inky water, and celluloids with metallic veining or marbling can have their gold or bronze-colored parts turn dull and chalky with water absorption.

## South Yorkshire police agree payouts for Hillsborough ‘cover-up’

Wow. It's almost enough to make you forget [Serpico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpico):

> South Yorkshire and West Midlands police have agreed a settlement with more than 600 people to compensate them for [the false police campaign](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-disaster-deadly-mistakes-and-lies-that-lasted-decades) aimed at avoiding responsibility for the 1989 Hillsborough disaster and blaming the victims instead, which bereaved families have always said was a cover-up.
> 
> The forces will pay compensation to families whose relatives were among the 96 men, women and children unlawfully killed at Hillsborough, and to survivors of the disaster, for additional trauma and psychiatric damage caused by the police campaign.

Conn, David. 2021. “[South Yorkshire And West Midlands Police Agree Payouts For Hillsborough ‘Cover-Up.’](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/04/south-yorkshire-police-agree-payouts-for-hillsborough-cover-up)” The Guardian. June 4, 2021.

## Firefox and its new UI

Some people, including myself, think Firefox looks strange following its graphical facelift that came with [version 89](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/89.0/releasenotes/). A GitHub identity by the name of MS\_Y has released [Lepton](https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix), a hack for making the new Firefox UI sweeter. I think it looks better. The GitHub page lists what they consider to be flaws in the new Firefox design: - Is it a tab or a button? - Where are the menu icons? - Icons in ActivityStream are too small - Padding gaps are wide - warning Address bar 3-point menu, screenshot moves to toolbar (can’t fix) The page contains some examples of what the hack looks like. ## Rubber duck debugging I was not aware of the [rubber-duck debugging method](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) until today:

> In software engineering, rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different (usually) inanimate objects, or pets such as a dog or a cat. "Desk check your code" is the original term for this technique.
> 
> Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem. In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent. More generally, teaching a subject forces its evaluation from different perspectives and can provide a deeper understanding. By using an inanimate object, the programmer can try to accomplish this without having to interrupt anyone else.

This reminds me of how [Michel de Montaigne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne) used essay-writing as a form of evolution in writing. His thoughts would come out onto a page, form, then possibly shift. Everything was in motion. I recommend Sarah Bakewell's more-than-excellent book [_How to Live: Or A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer_](https://sarahbakewell.com/books-3/how-to-live-a-life-of-montaigne/).

## Alexandria by Edmund Richardson review – the quest for the lost city

I had never heard of Charles Masson before reading this enchanting review of a newly-published book named _Alexandria: The Quest for the Lost City_.

> Yet for all his extraordinary achievements, Masson remained an enigma. Despite clear traces of a Cockney accent, he claimed to be “an American gentleman from Kentucky”. This was a cover story that few believed, and Masson had recently been imprisoned by the East India Company on suspicion of spying when he was picked up wandering, without papers, on the borders of Afghanistan. The company kept him in half-starved solitary confinement for six months, on an occasional diet of stale bread and sheep entrails, something that seems to have come close to unhinging him.

Dalrymple, William. 2021. “[Alexandria By Edmund Richardson Review – The Quest For The Lost City](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/may/27/alexandria-by-edmund-richardson-review-the-quest-for-the-lost-city).” The Guardian. May 27, 2021.

What an extraordinary life; Among his many different jaunts, Masson ventured across continents, deeply affected archeology, faked his own death, and (probably finally) died a pauper.

## Soulwax talk on Midnight Chats

One of my favourite bands, Soulwax, speak about the past and present.

> Soulwax brothers David and Stephen Dewaele talk to Stuart Stubbs about the unexpected, wild days of 2ManyDJs, their space age new studio and HQ in the centre of Ghent, their new TV show, Ibiza and more.

Loud and Quiet. 2021. “[108: Soulwax](https://www.loudandquiet.com/podcasts/soulwax-midnight-chats-episode-108/).”

It's fun to hear them talk about [their DEEWEE studio](https://www.dezeen.com/2021/05/07/soulwax-glenn-sestig-deewee-recording-studio/), the lovely documentary [_Part of the Weekend Never Dies_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2U4rOZgki8), [their new 'TV show'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2U4rOZgki8), and their truly seminal DJ mix, _[As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HYGAFQDhhg)._

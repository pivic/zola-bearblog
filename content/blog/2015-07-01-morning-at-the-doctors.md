_Some haunting scenes from the local doctor's._

I visited the local doctor's this morning. Catching an appointment that's available before the summer is about as possible as catching sunlight in a jar, so they recommended I'd pop down for "public reception".

I did, 20 minutes before they opened, and was slightly baffled: a 20-meter queue met me. Apparently I live in the past where turning up 15 minutes before opening hours is OK. People think Greece has it bad?! Well, I bitch. Still, imagine listening to this for the 20 minutes I waited to see somebody in reception:

I don't blame a kid for crying. It's the kid's dad who's my reason for griping. The kid repeated "I DON'T WANNA SEE A DOCTOR WAAAH I DON'T WANNA GOOO" which is understandable - _he's a kid_ - but the dad... He just replied "I know." or "Yes, I have heard you." whenever the kid complained. Gah.

I paid 200 SKR, met with a doctor for five minutes, was told that I need to see another doctor and that I'll have to meet another doctor in the future.

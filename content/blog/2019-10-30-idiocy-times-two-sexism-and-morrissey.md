The thread that Kate Manne's excellent tweets belong to...is breathtakingly stupid, and "Iain Macwhirter" doesn't realise it. Check the entire thread.

Morrissey signs other artists' LPs and charges 300 US Dollars for it.

> I think the original post got deleted but here’s the picture. The absolute hubris of charging $300 for a Bowie record signed by Morrissey is breathtaking.

Morrissey didn't say shit when Bowie died. Their joint tour went to pieces. And here 'Morrissey loves David'.

The fact that Morrissey charges one third more to autograph someone else's record than his own says something; I'm not sure what it says, but it's not good for islamophobe Moz.

Yes, still [no weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3718150.stm). Will there be within a few years? Hell no! Will there possibly be after the US government stop raping Iraq? Let me phrase it like this: if I were an Iraqi, being held hostage in my own country while terrorists (i.e. the US government, among other governments that are pro-this-land-rape) kill innocent people in vast numbers, killing our chances of regaining any independence every single day we were occupied, stealing our main natural resource (oil), would I be craving blood? YES.

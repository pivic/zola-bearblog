[Today I won a contest](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-12-13-dn.gif)! DN sent me a record containing demos from their picks of what they think will be the pop-stars of next year. More on that (in Swedish) [here](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=625&a=341042&previousRenderType=1).

Also, [they've written an article on Laleh](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1461&a=352320&previousRenderType=1), the good singer and songwriter whom [I've written about previously](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=387).

Tonight, Mikaela and I ate wonderfully nice scraps of lamb, chocolate, wine-drenched pears and drank drinks and wine at Patrik & Staffan's place. Sweeeet. Now bed. Tomorrow it's time to NBA at Rade's.

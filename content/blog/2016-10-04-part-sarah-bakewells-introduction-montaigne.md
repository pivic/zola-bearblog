[![Michel de Montaigne](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2013-11-12_1120.png)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2013-11-12_1120.png)

I've come to realise that I probably never will stop writing about this subject.

The following short quote on **[**Michel de Montaigne**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne)**'s importance to those reading his texts from the 1500s, which is culled from [Sarah Bakewell](https://sarahbakewell.com)'s absolutely astounding and supremely recommendable book titelled "_[How To Live: A Life Of Montaigne](https://sarahbakewell.com/books-3/how-to-live-a-life-of-montaigne/)_", says so much of how much Montaigne's "essays" mean to people, even though hundreds of years have passed since Montaigne's death:

> [Tabourot des Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Tabourot), said that anyone reading the Essays felt as if they themselves had written it. Over two hundred and fifty years later, the essayist [Ralph Waldo Emerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson) said the same thing in almost the same phrase. “It seemed to me as if I had myself written the book, in some former life.” “So much have I made him my own,” wrote the twentieth-century novelist [André Gide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Gide), “that it seems he is my very self.” And [Stefan Zweig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Zweig), an Austrian writer on the verge of suicide after being forced into exile during the Second World War, found in Montaigne his only real friend: “Here is a ‘you’ in which my ‘I’ is reflected; here is where all distance is abolished.” The printed page fades from view; a living person steps into the room instead. “Four hundred years disappear like smoke.”

The following are quotes from the introduction to Bakewell's book

Yesterday started lovely, but soon became tragic.

X noticed how Lotta was dragging her hind legs behind, seemingly non-responsive. She desperately wanted to move but was unable to, other than by using her front legs. We wondered if she'd eaten something she shouldn't have, or if she'd sprained a leg, but both? We contacted an on-call emergency veterinarian who said she wouldn't have the time, so Ulrika was kind enough to pack X, myself and Lotta into her car and drive 71 kilometers from [Flen](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=59.0559164%2C16.5897578&hl=en&z=11&ie=UTF8) to [](http://www.regdjsh.se)[Regiondjursjukhuset Str√∂msholm](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=59.5212629%2C16.2506851&hl=en&z=16&ie=UTF8).

Lotta was also unable to breathe properly, gasping for air to and fro before and after we left for the hospital. Well there, it felt as though the very entrance of the hospital was a place of Death instead of one that spawns Life, somewhere Lotta would be laid to rest instead of healed.

Sadly, that sentiment was correct.

The staff was utterly professional and very sensitive towards X and myself; they quickly diagnosed Lotta with [thrombus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus), which in her case meant that blood was coagulating in paths of her legs; in other words, Lotta's legs were dying. They felt cold already before we left for the hospital. The good news was that Lotta felt no pain. X and I quickly agreed to have Lotta put to permanent sleep through an overdose of sleeping medication. We photographed her, we petted her, we gave her love. I felt that I wanted her to be with us. Don't part. Don't hurt. Don't die. We love you, Lotta.

Her name is partly Whole Lotta Love, as she was born on Valentine's Day. The picture below was taken two days ago. I shot loads of pictures from the clinic. That's the saddest day in a long, long while. Blixa's alone now. And I'll love them both forever. And Lotta will live on in my heart, and sit proudly upon the warmest TV where Kitties go when they die. I love you, Lotta. No words will ever do your grey, big self justice. Your warmth reverberates on and on and on.

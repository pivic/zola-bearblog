[An article](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=14947504&method=full&siteid=50143) in the despickable tabloid paper The Daily Mirror shows how racists are too stupid for anybody's good:

> Official Bob Garner said: "There was a bit of a cock-up. The chap who booked him didn't realise. The DJ sounded white on the phone."
> 
> Labour MP Martin Salter said last night: "This just shows they'll never be a legitimate political party.
> 
> "They're just poisonous bigots who think they can tell the colour of someone's skin from the other end of a phone line."

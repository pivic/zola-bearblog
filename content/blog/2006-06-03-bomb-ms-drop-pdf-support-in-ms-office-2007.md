[This](http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_to_Drop_PDF_Support_in_Office/1149284222) will undoubtedly make for two things:

1\. Microsoft will better their [Metro](http://www.pdfzone.com/article2/0,1759,1823998,00.asp) and push XPS wildly. 2. Adobe will strike up new functionalities for their products à¡ la MS do with Vista and Office 2007.

Luckily, users of MS Windows still have [PDF Creator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator), which is free.

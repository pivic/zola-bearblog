I know he's been subjected to interrogations and ransackings of his abodes while living in England (not only, but in part due to The Smiths' song "[The Queen Is Dead](http://www.oz.net/~moz/lyrics/thequeen/thequeen.htm)" and his soloist "[Margaret On The Guillotine](http://www.oz.net/~moz/lyrics/vivahate/margaret.htm)") and even topped John Lydon on those accounts, but now he's been interrogated by both the FBI and the Special Branch. Wonderful. Because Dubya is a terrorist? No-one knows.

More on that, [here](http://contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/morrissey%20quizzed%20by%20fbi_23_02_2006).

It's like The Kingsmen's "[Louie Louie](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/louie/louie.html)" yet again. For more on how Morrissey rules, go [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=889). For a bit of Johnny Marr on the recording of "The Queen Is Dead", venture [hither](http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/music/features/article347296.ece).

To get to know how my splitting head-ache is increasing by every minute, bash your head into a concrete wall every second, in tact with your heart-beat. Jesper and Tamara, you ruin my good health.

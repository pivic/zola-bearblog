Ever wondered how you can get your data from companies that have it?

Thanks to **[Tapmydata](https://tapmydata.com/)** and GDPR—that much-hated acronym—you can.

Companies have thirty days to comply with your subject access request (SAR) according to [section 12.3 of GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/); in some cases, if your request is "complex", the timeframe can be extended to sixty days.

Tapmydata is a new app, available for both Android and iOS, that enables users to almost automatically request companies to supply data that you can see. Yes, you, and only you: Tapmydata cannot access it.

In this day and age, as Facebook have [created their own currency](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/18/what-is-libra-facebook-new-cryptocurrency), and [allow white-supremacist organisations to not be vetted](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleDieInside/comments/dpny2m/mark_zuckerberg_vs_aoc/), and [sold advertisements to people who expressed interest in topics like 'Jew hater', 'How to burn jews', and 'History of "why jews ruin the world"'](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters), we need help to know what companies know about us.

I've used it for a day and have already received great feedback from it.

Some companies, e.g. Zalando and Bandsintown, both don't respond to Tapmydata but have e-mailed me separately; Zalando have taken it seriously, while Bandsintown have quickly sent me a list of the data types that they have on me, i.e. not the actual data:

Yeah, not exactly right: gimme the data, plz!

Anyway, Bandsintown aren't—hopefully—nefarious and sell my data to Facebook, the Republican party of USA, or even sverigedemokraterna, the quasi-political Swedish extreme-right-wing party.

Get Tapmydata now and get your data back at the same time.

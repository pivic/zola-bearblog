Kickstarter can be really pretty. Thanks to that platform, this documentary has been made. It's about **[The Jesus and Mary Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_and_Mary_Chain)**, **[My Bloody Valentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bloody_Valentine_(band))** and **[Cocteau Twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocteau_Twins)**, and contains a whole bunch of interviews with seemingly relevant people. It's set to premiere soon. Time to amp up, even though the new Lykke Li album is just too addictive...

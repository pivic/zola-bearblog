I love Super Furry Animals. The band, as well as animals of that kind, of course.

And now there's [another reason to love them](http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2005/11/1808.cfm). They've said no to Coca-Cola, when the corporation asked SFA for legal permission to use a song of theirs, "Hello Sunshine", in order to promote their fizzy drink. Rhys tells it, courtesy of [Chartattack](http://www.chartattack.com):

> "But when someone offers you so much money, you have to consider it. You can't be frivolous about something like that. It was as much money as they gave Pakistan after the recent earthquake, which made me think, 'If they could afford that much money for us, I'm sure they can give more to victims of an enormous earthquake.'"

> The Pakistan earthquake figure, in case you were curious, was $2 million U.S. While the Furries refused to sell their souls to the cola kings, would they shill for anyone else?
> 
> "We'd consider offers from Meca Cola \[a Spanish cola\] and Red Stripe \[a Jamaican beer\]. Especially Red Stripe ads, where they have us come to Jamaica to shoot the ad," Rhys jokes.

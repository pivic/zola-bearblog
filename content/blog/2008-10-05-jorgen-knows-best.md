X's uncle Jörgen always gets the stick for kinda, well, being a know-it-all. So, when he decided to be a contestant on Swedish TV's new quiz-show called "Vem Vet Bäst?" ((Which in English means "Who Knows Best?")), I knew I had to see it. To great success. Here's my personal edit of his two answered questions:

    

If you know Swedish, you'll by now probably know - or have guessed - that he answered both questions incorrectly. Poor Jörgen! But saying that miljöpartiet's ((I.e. the Swedish equivalent of the green party.)) _male_ mouthpiece was [Gudryn Schyman](http://www.riksdagen.se/upload/bilder/ledamotsbilder/0236004923301_max.jpg), just doesn't cut it. And the host of the show then tells him that Jörgen would probably get to hear about that from his friends and family; oh you're damn right about that!

Rock on, Jörgen!

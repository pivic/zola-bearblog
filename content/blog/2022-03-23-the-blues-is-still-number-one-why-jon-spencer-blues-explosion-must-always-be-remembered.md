From Joshua Ross on that youtube page:

**guide to the blues**:

1:38 push the cameraman out of the way for the theremin solo  
1:43 he didn't take the hint so push the camera  
2:03 run for the mic, grab it off the tech guy, drag the mic stand behind you  
2:12 give the host a shake, jab your finger in his face  
2:22 get in the crowd  
2:30 another theremin solo  
3:09 having introduced the band and done a James Brown false finish, do another theremin solo  
3:35 get right in the crowd, there's no staircase so climb inbetween children and see which ones get embarrassed by the camera being on them and which are cool  
4:07 fall over  
4:12 climb on a kitchen counter  
4:25 attack a giant inflatable R with a crown  
4:35 leapfrog drumkit to bring down your own name  
4:53 give the camera another push  
4:56 conduct the crowd's applause  
5:07 bow, walk off stage with instrument, do not acknowledge crowd

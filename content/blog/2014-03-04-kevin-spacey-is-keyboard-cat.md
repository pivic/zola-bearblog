From the Jimmy Kimmel show:

> Many of this year's Oscar nominated films were adapted from books, including The Wolf of Wall Street, Captain Phillips, and Twelve Years a Slave - but times are changing. Our plan is to escort the movie business into the 21st century, so we enlisted the help of some of the greatest talents in the world of film to help us adapt popular YouTube videos into big-budget Hollywood movies. Here's an adaptation of the YouTube classics "Keyboard Cat" "Hamster on a Piano" and "Dramatic Chipmunk" starring Kevin Spacey, Christoph Waltz, Gary Oldman, Ben Kingsley, Abbie Cornish and Mandy Patinkin.

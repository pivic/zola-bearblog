Yesterday morning I returned from a blissful Berlin trip - more on that in a coming post - and this morning I'm still slowly detoxing from all the liquids, food and sugar that I ingested. Not to mention my Tresor withdrawal symptoms! But I'm slowly getting back to life this morning thanks to Mr. Jeff Mills and his terrific live mix-album "_[Live at The Liquid Room, Tokyo](http://www.discogs.com/Jeff-Mills-Live-At-The-Liquid-Room-Tokyo/release/9459)_".

**Bonus**: let's see if you can play _spot the difference_ between a couple of pictures I shot this morning.

I even like the skips at the end of the video. And I haven't played [that vinyl](http://www.discogs.com/Aphex-Twin-On/release/28060) since 1993.

OK, so we've bought a vinyl player. Finally! I haven't owned one in 20 years until today.

A few things have hit me since playing songs on it:

I love to pick up the needle and drop it somewhere else on a physical vinyl disc, which I can physically _read_; being able to tell the tempo and moves from eyeing the grooves is weird and nerdy cool.

I have to walk over and check the cover and match it to where the needle is on the record to see which song is playing. If I'm able to; just imagine seamless DJ-mixed vinyls.

Nothing gets submitted to last.fm - and I love it.

There's a completely different acoustic than through the computer or headphones. It's an intensely analogue feel, and no matter how I try to convey that feeling it just has to be felt. And yes, in this case it definitely has to do with the hardware. The speakers from the box are left and right, and it's very different from anything else. It's not computed. It's not constant. There's a band pulling a wheel which makes the disc revolve at 33 1/3 laps a minute and it's anything but perfect.

It _is_ perfect, though.

And I can use it to rip vinyl to the computer thanks to a very non-old USB connection in the back, amidst all 1950s styling. Luckily, the connection is in the back.

Before laying vinyl to rest on the plate you clean it. No matter how thoroughly I do this, there will always be dust that results in snaps, crackles and pops. And that's the way it's supposed to be, d'accord.

I can't wait to listen to Brian Eno and David Byrne's "_[My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Life_in_the_Bush_of_Ghosts_%28album%29)_" on this and just drift off.

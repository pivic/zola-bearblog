I love Mondo. They're kind of a toy store version of [Criterion](http://criterion.com), although there's nothing toy-y about the wondrous quality of the stuff they reissue ((Bar the spelling mistakes on the otherwise flawless Twin Peaks reissue.)). [They've reissued the Twin Peaks soundtrack](https://mondotees.com/blogs/news/new-record-release-twin-peaks-original-score-lp) which was sweet in the extreme, and now [they're reissuing the soundtrack for "](https://mondotees.com/blogs/news/new-music-release-fight-club-original-soundtrack-2xlp)_[Fight Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club)_", and the film below is just too cool. I mean, **sacrifice**:

Also, they're re-releasing the soundtrack for "_[Gremlins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins)_", the old 1980s film about Donald Trump's takeover of the USA monsters terrorising a neighbourhood. It's still basically a comedy.

In the film, Mogwai - a little furry animal that's harmless - turn into Gremlins if exposed to sunlight, water or are fed "after midnight". Here's some cover art for the Mondo reissue:

...and the same cover if you expose it to UV light:

[![Scary](http://static.flickr.com/46/134225667_8f04094685_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=134225667)Jesper celebrated his 30th birthday this Sunday, and it's always fun to meet people you usually only meet in those circumstances, apart from a few others; Peter and his girlfriend moved to Fruängen a couple of days ago, I helped them move, and it was great fun seeing him, Stephan and Jesper again. Children everywhere. Jesper and Marie's little Tove has turned bigger in just one week! The fierce bouncer has gained 1 Kg. Moahaa!

Have you bought "[The God Who Wasn't There](https://niklasblog.com/?p=781)"? Now you're [fully allowed to make a DVD-R-copy and give it to a christian](http://www.slumdance.com/blogs/brian_flemming/archives/002109.html). Oh, you [christians](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/duver001/nwn/013585.html)!

[30 Boxes have now incorporated e-mail-integration](http://30boxes.com/blog/index.php/2006/04/23/30-boxes-delivers-email-integration). This means that if you send or forward an e-mail to e-mail add (a) 30boxes.com with something like "Talk with god 1/5 13:00 tag private" in the subject-line, it will pop up in your calendar. All you have to do is approve the e-mail-address that you're sending your e-mails from; and if they're HTML-formatted, the information in your 30 Boxes calendar will be, too.

I just found a nice digital [demo-version of The Guardian](http://digital.guardian.co.uk/demo), one of my fave papers. Yeah, it's [on the web](http://www.guardian.co.uk) since years past, but this version is different. By clicking a section of a smallish image of a page of an issue, you get access to that text, and not a digital facsimile. Very nice, although I love the usual digital edition.

Speaking of which, [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/food/Story/0,,1759888,00.html), an excerpt from Eric Schlosser's coming book called "[Chew On This : Everything You Don't Want to Know About Fast Food](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=niklasblog-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%3Fsearch-type=ss%26index=blended%26keyword=)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)" shows great journalism and horrid undercurrents due to the fast-food-business. From the article:

> The relationship between big companies and small children has changed enormously in the past 30 years. Until recently, just a handful of companies aimed their advertising at children and they mainly sold breakfast cereals and toys. By 2002, however, the top five food advertisers in the UK were McDonald's, Coca-Cola, KFC and Pizza Hut. British food companies now spend Â£300m every year advertising to kids. Business people now realise that kids have a lot of money to spend and a lot of influence on what their parents buy. Every year in the United States children are responsible for more than $500bn worth of spending. Big companies want that money. And too often they are willing to manipulate kids in order to get it.

> 
> The fast food chains now work closely with leading toy makers, giving away small toys with children's meals and selling larger ones at their restaurants. As part of its Happy Meals programme, McDonald's has worked with Fisher Price to give away Toddler Toys aimed at kids aged one to three. One of the Fisher Price toys was a tiny doll of a McDonald's worker holding a milkshake. Both McDonald's and Burger King have given away Teletubbies dolls. Teletubbies is aimed at children too young to speak.

> "McDonald's is in some ways a toy company, not a food company," says one retired fast food executive. Indeed, McDonald's is perhaps the largest toy company in the world. It sells or gives away more than 1.5 billion toys every year.

Effing horrible, and read that article/excerpt. Writing of which, [child-obesity among English children has _doubled_ in ten years](http://society.guardian.co.uk/health/story/0,,1758574,00.html). Ban McEats, I say.

[![Hendrix scared](http://static.flickr.com/54/134226719_fb76aec55d_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=134226719) Oh yeah, [another article](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1759223,00.html) about Primal Scream, this time interviewing backstage, where Bobby Gillespie chats merrily, and it is announced that Throb is having "personal issues". I wish him the best, and eagerly await their coming album.

[Bob Dylan's DJ'ing](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1759471,00.html). Say no more!

Don't miss [Roger Ebert's list of 100 films you have to see](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060420/EDITOR/60419010).

Finally, Sweden is announcing that the country is [accepting "w" as an individual letter](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&a=538744&previousRenderType=3). Don't ask why. I mean, we've adopted the metric system, but not accepting "w" as an individual letter (as it was formerly, somehow, mashed together with "v") was really stupid. On the other hand, this means that a few books are going to have to be revised, loads of computer-systems to be updated and people to get it. Well, [Svenska Akademiens ordlista över svenska språket](http://spraakdata.gu.se/saol), the unofficial Swedish dictionary, is finally [out in a new edition](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1353&a=538173&previousRenderType=3). Some weird words have been included (e.g. _nakenchock_ ("nudity-shock"; and you thought Swedes couldn't shock themselves with nudity! Also noteworthy are _fredagsmys_ ("having a nice, calm time on a Friday" - I can't come up with anything more specific than that, I just keep laughing at the mere term), _homoäktenskap_ ("homo-marriage") and _sexist_ ("sexist"). More new words are found [here](http://www.svenskaakademien.se/litiuminformation/site/page.asp?Page=1&IncPage=1469&Destination=5).

[![Evil tussan](http://static.flickr.com/47/134226642_197be755c8_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=134226642) Microsoft are busy with "Metro", their "PDF-killer". They're thinking that PDF needs resistance, so they came up with the XPS-format. If you use Office 2007, you will be able to export your files as XPS-files _and_ PDF-files. Oh-kay. So why? Microsoft claims the XPS-format will bring more functionality to the table. They've only managed to squeeze out a very irritating viewer which meant you had to install frameworks and after that you were able to open your XPS-files (if you had any, and if you weren't beta-testing Office 12/2007, chances were you couldn't even find any XPS-files on the web), but now there's [a new XPS-viewer](http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/xps/viewxps.mspx) on the block, that doesn't require a lot of installing, is small and opens said documents in a new windows. There you go, Microsoft! Let's just see how far the XPS-format will travel.

Don't miss out on Atari Teenage Riot's "[Revolution Action](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiFEEI4b3KQ)", performed live. Oh, ATR, I love you.

Ever found yourself desiring a digital, nice copy of a picture you've taken of a whiteboard, filled with interesting, vital doodles? Or a post-it-note or maybe a document you'd like cleaned up easily? Check out [Scanr](http://www.scanr.com/try.aspx). I tried it myself, so [here's my own test](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-04-18-scanr.jpg "Scanr can be good."). Dunno if I will use it more than during the test, through, as my mobile phone isn't 1 Megapixel tough enough. Still, I can use it for documents, when I'm tired of scanning and using the set contrast-lever.

[![Lunch at Nitty Gritty Café](http://static.flickr.com/49/134263350_bf2aaedc32_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=134263350) I had this dish today, a very spicy soup courtesy of Magnus, who is the chef, caretaker and all-in-all everybody at Nitty Gritty Café. It was good, and I had tears in my eyes from it; yeah, it's that strong. And even though I don't really like cilantro, it worked. [Some people _hate_ cilantro](http://www.ihatecilantro.com).

...while some people write [very funny, scathing reviews](http://ideasofimperfection.blogspot.com/2006/04/economy-of-prestige.html).

I just saw that version 2.0 of [Wink](http://www.debugmode.com/wink) has been released; this program is the best freeware I've seen as far as screen-casting is concerned. Here are the hard-to-find news about it (only available, as far as I've found, in the readme-file included in the downloadable package):

> Wink has been completely rewritten for version 2.0. Currently version 2.0 is available only for Windows; a Linux version will be available soon. The following is a list of the most important new features in Wink 2.0 among many improvements, changes and bug fixes. Â· Translated to more languages Â· Undo/Redo Â· Unlimited textboxes Â· Unlimited buttons Â· URL Buttons to open a webpage when clicked Â· Image objects Â· Shape objects, create and use shapes just like callouts with no text Â· Audio (can record while capturing, as well as add/edit later) Â· Improved and simpler properties panel Â· Improved flow of control in output swf file so no more flickering of title/callouts when no buttons are used Â· Ability to disable frames in a project so they won't appear in output

[![Marie's mom, Erika and Stephan](http://static.flickr.com/49/134226093_f08d929215_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=134226093) Need an online spell-checker? [Here](http://orangoo.com/spell)'s a quick one, that provides help in a lot of different lingos.

The headline says it all: "[Cat army annihilates destructive rats](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-04/12/content_565926.htm)", and I can't tell you how much I love it. Hail the kitties!

Do you commute a long time? Remember, there's always [somebody who's got it worse](http://www.theregister.com/2006/04/13/cisco_commute). And hasn't been aware of it, due to..._brain fever_?

A few short techy links: [know more about MS Word](http://generaldisarray.wordpress.com/2006/04/14/ten-things-every-microsoft-word-user-should-know), [here](http://www.darknet.org.uk/2006/04/top-15-securityhacking-tools-utilities)'s a great list of hacking-tools (be nice, now) and thanks to [this site](http://man.splitbrain.org) you're using man freely again - or just use [their Firefox search-engine](http://mycroft.mozdev.org/download.html?name=splitbrain&submitform=Search).

I have to end by saying it's looking like the pollen-season is coming to Stockholm. I felt like shit at work, the eyes itching, the nose getting clogged-up and I had trouble breathing. At home, the TV-channels were filled with reports about pollen hitting Stockholm. Bastards. Mikaela was so very nice in picking up the proper drugs for me. Aah, now, oblivion.

Microsoft are trying to help people migrate from previous versions of MS Office to v2007. That's helpful. [Here](http://tinyurl.com/39yvrh) are a few hints. [Here](http://tinyurl.com/yw5wxz)'s a whitepaper on migrating to MS Excel 2007 from previous versions.

And [here](http://blogs.business2.com/beta/2007/03/us_government_b.html)'s why the US Department of Transport has now banned MS Office 2007 and Windows Vista. Turnaround's a bitch, you [habitual line-stepper](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=habitual+line+stepper).

Last but not least, let's not forget that Microsoft apparently benefits from pirating their software. [According to themselves](http://techdirt.com/articles/20070312/165448.shtml). And that doesn't stop MS from (at least indirectly) using pirated software themselves, e.g. [this time](http://slashdot.org/articles/04/11/13/0036243.shtml).

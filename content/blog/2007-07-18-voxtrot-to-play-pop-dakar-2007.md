Holy f-ing lord.

Voxtrot just announced a buckload of new dates in Europe, and they're playing in Stockholm on the 1st of September this year at [Pop Dakar](http://www.popdakar.nu). YES! YES! YES!

More dates from Voxtrot are available [here](http://www.voxtrot.net/page1.htm). Just because I'm so happy about this, here's a video of a part of the band doing synchronised swimming. Enjoy.

On a slightly more serious note, here's a year-old live clip of them playing "Missing Pieces", off the "Raised By Wolves" EP.

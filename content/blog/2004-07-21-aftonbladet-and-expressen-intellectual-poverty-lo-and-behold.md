In Sweden, there are virtually only two daily evening papers - Aftonbladet ("The Evening Paper") and Expressen ("The Express"). The morning papers are considered quite serious, while the evening papers are turning into The Sun and vile trash like it.

Anyway, today's news bills are these: [Aftonbladet](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-21-aftonbladet_2.jpg) and [Expressen](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-21-expressen.jpg). Here are translations of the two bills:

Aftonbladet: "Transvestite-COUP DURING MASS-SINGING at Skansen \[popular Swedish family attraction\] that TV DIDN'T SHOW"

Expressen: "AFTER DARK \[famous Swedish drag-outfit\] IN HIV-BRAWL after THE MASS-SINGING".

I'd love to know just what a "transvestite-COUP" and a "HIV-BRAWL" is. Actually, I really would. So I've e-mailed the people who are responsible for the articles about these subjects, at the two beforementioned papers. I'll post any progressions (in the comments section of this post) that may come, but trust me, the journalists at these papers mostly just don't reply. I know, as Rade and myself have e-mailed these crappy papers from time to time, asking them to just step outside their sell-your-own-grandmother-for-a-dollar cocksucking routine for a minute.

Firstly, I may add that Fredrik Svedjetun, the noble writer of the "Transvestite-COUP"-bit, actually has worked for both Aftonbladet and Expressen. Oh yeah.

Lastly, in my e-mails I added that I wondered if the journalists who wrote these articles know they are killing off the collective unconsciousness in our society by writing worthless stuffs or of that's just an extra treat.

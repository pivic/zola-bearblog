## MICHELANGELO ANTONIONI'S 'L'AVVENTURA'

Michelangelo Antonioni invented a new film grammar with this masterwork. An iconic piece of challenging 1960s cinema and a gripping narrative on its own terms, _L’avventura_ concerns the enigmatic disappearance of a young woman during a yachting trip off the coast of Sicily, and the search taken up by her disaffected lover (Gabriele Ferzetti) and best friend (Monica Vitti, in her breakout role). Antonioni’s controversial international sensation is a gorgeously shot tale of modern ennui and spiritual isolation.

## AKIRA KUROSAWA'S 'IKIRU'

One of the greatest achievements by Akira Kurosawa, _Ikiru_ shows the director at his most compassionate—affirming life through an explora­tion of death. Takashi Shimura beautifully portrays Kanji Watanabe, an aging bureaucrat with stomach cancer who is impelled to find meaning in his final days. Presented in a radically conceived two-­part structure and shot with a perceptive, humanistic clarity of vision, _Ikiru_ is a multifaceted look at what it means to be alive.

## BRUCE ROBINSON'S 'WITHNAIL AND I'

London. The 1960s. Two unemployed actors—acerbic, elegantly wasted Withnail (Richard E. Grant) and the anxiety-ridden “I” (Paul McGann)—drown their frustrations in booze, pills, and lighter fluid. When Withnail’s Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths) offers his cottage, they escape the squalor of their flat for a week in the country. They soon realize they’ve gone on holiday by mistake when their wits—and friendship—are sorely tested by violent downpours, less than hospitable locals, and empty cupboards. An intelligent, superbly acted, and hilarious film, Bruce Robinson’s semi-autobiographical cult favorite is presented here in its complete and uncut version.

## JOSHUA OPPENHEIMER'S  
'THE ACT OF KILLING'

In a place where killers are celebrated as heroes, these filmmakers challenge unrepentant death-squad leaders to dramatize their role in genocide. The result is a surreal, cinematic journey, not only into the memories and imaginations of mass murderers, but also into a frighteningly banal regime of corruption and impunity.

## CÉLINE SCIAMMA'S 'GIRLHOOD'

Céline Sciamma is one of the forefront auteurs for the past ten years. I can't say enough good things about her. This film encapsulates her genius, and the soundtrack by Para One helps.

## TONY RICHARDSON'S  
'A TASTE OF HONEY'

The revolutionary British New Wave films of the early 1960s were celebrated for their uncompromising depictions of working-class lives and relations between the sexes. Directed by Tony Richardson, a leading light of that movement, and based on one of the most controversial plays of its time, _A Taste of Honey_ features Rita Tushingham in her star-making debut role as a disaffected teenager finding her way amid the economic desperation of industrial Manchester, and despite her absent, self-absorbed mother. With its unapologetic identification with social outcasts and its sensitive, modern approach to matters of sexuality and race, Richardson’s classic is a still startling benchmark work of realism.

Based on [Stephen Trask](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FStephen_Trask&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGaWcBgLqgIu4RcdRIZBTGYDki0Jg)'s [stage musical of the same name](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHedwig_and_the_Angry_Inch_%28musical%29&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHmZJ8nb_KBQfV7LHSmM3h2Rn__ig), the film follows a fictional [rock band](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRock_music&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE3cMgXV2XXv_ypOKHZaGq1zcOtrA) fronted by an [East German](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEast_German&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHLgLRca1E6UY9jXbsSBZ8dFT2fKA) [genderqueer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGenderqueer&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEtHXBAG07be6dXjGXKaR6inyaU1g) singer who survives a botched [sex change operation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSexual_reassignment_surgery&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHSgfCcWtMUr4H70ZUVQP0ydGhOzg).

## NOBUHIKO OBAYASHI'S 'HOUSE'

![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/image-72.png)

How to describe Nobuhiko Obayashi’s indescribable 1977 movie _House_(_Hausu_)? As a psychedelic ghost tale? A stream-of-consciousness bedtime story? An episode of _Scooby-Doo_ as directed by Mario Bava? Any of the above will do for this hallucinatory head trip about a schoolgirl who travels with six classmates to her ailing aunt’s creaky country home and comes face-to-face with evil spirits, a demonic house cat, a bloodthirsty piano, and other ghoulish visions, all realized by Obayashi via mattes, animation, and collage effects. Equally absurd and nightmarish, _House_ might have been beamed to Earth from some other planet. Never before available on home video in the United States, it’s one of the most exciting cult discoveries in years.

## CHARLES LAUGHTON'S  
'THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER'

![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/image-74.png)

Robert Mitchum, _The Night of the Hunter._

_The Night of the Hunter_—incredibly, the only film the great actor Charles Laughton ever directed—is truly a stand-alone masterwork. A horror movie with qualities of a Grimm fairy tale, it stars a sublimely sinister Robert Mitchum as a traveling preacher named Harry Powell (he of the tattooed knuckles), whose nefarious motives for marrying a fragile widow, played by Shelley Winters, are uncovered by her terrified young children. Graced by images of eerie beauty and a sneaky sense of humor, this ethereal, expressionistic American classic—also featuring the contributions of actress Lillian Gish and writer James Agee—is cinema’s most eccentric rendering of the battle between good and evil.

## TERRENCE MALICK'S 'BADLANDS'

_Badlands_ announced the arrival of a major talent: Terrence Malick. His impressionistic take on the notorious Charles Starkweather killing spree of the late 1950s uses a serial-killer narrative as a springboard for an oblique teenage romance, lovingly and idiosyncratically enacted by Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek. The film introduced many of the elements that would earn Malick his passionate following: the enigmatic approach to narrative and character, the unusual use of voice-over, the juxtaposition of human violence with natural beauty, the poetic investigation of American dreams and nightmares. This debut has spawned countless imitations, but none have equaled its strange sublimity.

## JEAN RENOIR'S  
'LA RÈGLE DU JEU'

Considered one of the greatest films ever made, _The Rules of the Game_ (_La règle du jeu_), by Jean Renoir, is a scathing critique of corrupt French society cloaked in a comedy of manners in which a weekend at a marquis’ country château lays bare some ugly truths about a group of haut bourgeois acquaintances. The film has had a tumultuous history: it was subjected to cuts after the violent response of the premiere audience in 1939, and the original negative was destroyed during World War II; it wasn’t reconstructed until 1959.

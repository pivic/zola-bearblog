Read on, Flav...  

Here they come, high and low:

From the article:

**Y**ou already know it’s bad. You already know the weather has gone weird, the ice caps are melting, the insects are disappearing from the Earth. You already know that your children, and your children’s children, if they are reckless or brave enough to reproduce, face a vista of rising seas, vanishing coastal cities, storms, wildfires, biblical floods. As someone who reads the news and is sensitive to the general mood of the times, you have a general sense of what we’re looking at. But do you truly understand the scale of the tribulations we face? [David Wallace-Wells](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/03/david-wallace-wells-on-climate-people-should-be-scared-im-scared), [author of the distressingly titled ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/02/the-devastation-of-human-life-is-in-view-what-a-burning-world-tells-us-about-climate-change-global-warming)_[The Uninhabitable Earth](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/02/the-devastation-of-human-life-is-in-view-what-a-burning-world-tells-us-about-climate-change-global-warming)_, is here to tell you that you do not. “It is,” as he puts it in the book’s first line, “worse, much worse, than you think.”

I really want to read that book, which is Kate Manne's "_[Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny](http://www.katemanne.net/book.html)_". Here's an excerpt from the article above:

The above article is about George Hutchinson's book "_Facing the Abyss_". Here's a good paragraph from the article:

Why is computer programming sadly balanced, gender-wise, today in comparison with days of yore? Check this article out.

On that note:

Elsevier is known for two things:

1. publishing most of the scientific articles in the world, hence deciding who gets to access them - if they can pay
2. constantly upping the price that schools must pay to allow their students to access the publications

Here's a slightly older article about Reed-Elsevier being too big for the intellectual good for the scientific community:

I'm actually reading the book—"_Dreyer's English_" by Benjamin Dreyer—that this article is about, and it's enticing and funny as fuck. I love this story, by the way, that's from the book:

The Celebrated Ending-a-Sentence-with-a-Preposition Story

Two women are seated side by side at a posh dinner party, one a matron of the sort played in the old Marx Brothers movies by Margaret Dumont, except frostier, the other an easygoing southern gal, let’s say, for the sake of the visuals, wearing a very pink and very ruffled evening gown.  
  
**Southern Gal,** amiably, to Frosty Matron: So where y’all from?  
  
**Frosty Matron**, no doubt giving Southern Gal a once-over through a lorgnette: I’m from a place where people don’t end their sentences with prepositions.  
  
**Southern Gal,** sweetly, after a moment’s consideration: OK. So where y’all from, bitch?

Three cheers for Mark Hollis; I loved Talk Talk's album "_The Colour of Spring_".

From the article:

And then there was the saga of the video for It’s My Life itself. The first version consisted of wildlife footage intercut with shots of [Mark Hollis](https://www.theguardian.com/music/mark-hollis) glowering at the camera, mouth clamped shut. When their record label protested, Talk Talk made a second version, miming theatrically and lip-syncing deliberately out of time, as if mocking the whole business. You didn’t win over MTV behaving like that.

Here's a brilliant song:

https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/24/young-comics-verdict-standup-legend-bill-hicks

Young, current comedians discuss Bill Hicks' legacy, and his pitfalls. In my heart of hearts, I think Bill would have welcomed most of this quite fair critique.

This brilliant article shows what happens when tests and creation is made for men, and not with others in mind.

Some things to bear in mind from this article:

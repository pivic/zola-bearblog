Here's the fifth installment of my muxtape, and you'll play it [here](http://pivic.muxtape.com).

1\. **Barry De Vorzon** - "Theme from The Warriors"

Even though [some](http://tumblr.pivic.com/post/31352354) don't know what "[The Warriors](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120)" is, this is a swift reminder of the great soundtrack. Analogue synths with arpeggios team with guitars to sound rough. Remember, suckers?

> **Cyrus**: Now, here's the sum total: One gang could run this city! One gang. Nothing would move without us allowing it to happen. We could tax the crime syndicates, the police, because WE got the streets, suckers! Can you dig it? **Gang Members**: YEAH!

2\. **Beastie Boys** - "Stand Together"

When I saw them live for the first time, these guys played this as their intro. As the crescendo kicked in, people went happy, and I went down into the ground, trampled by the masses. And yes, I was happy.

3\. **Tindersticks** - "Feel The Sun"

From [their](http://www.tindersticks.co.uk) new album, "Hungry Saw", here's a sombre, nice track that brings memories of yore; mind you, "yore" is their album "[Curtains](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fbfwxqyhldfe)", that I loved on its release.

4\. **Billy Swan** - "I Can Help"

A modern-day classic from Gus van Sant's brilliant film "[Paranoid Park](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0842929)", this is an odd track. Good voice and...a nice message.

5\. **Daft Punk** - "Oh Yeah"

Off their debut album, this is one of the tracks that wasn't released as a single; it just goes to show how snippets of silence can create funkiness and that said album doesn't contain a single filler.

6\. **The Last Shadow Puppets** - "My Mistakes Were Made For You"

This is a duo consisting of Alex Turner from Arctic Monkeys and Miles Kane from The Rascals, making tracks as if [Scott Walker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Walker_(singer)) continued doing his thing. Produced by a guy from Simian Mobile Disco, no less.

7\. **Portishead** - "Hunter"

From their new album, "Third", come these Bristolians with a tweaked sound, reviving themselves after having scrapped nearly an albumful as they thought that it sounded too much like...themselves. Daring, and it seems to have paid off. The new album is spellbinding.

8\. **The Stone Roses** - "Driving South"

From their second and - what will in all probability be - their final album, this is a boogie-trip with a brilliant riff. As a lot of people diss the album from whence this is ripped, I retort to say it's got a lot of highs - check out "Ten Storey Love Song" and "Begging You" from the album to see what I mean.

9\. **Charlotte Hatherley** - "Kim Wilde"

Before Ms. Hatherley left Ash to go solo, she released a wonderful, quirky pop-album filled with hooks and turns that reminded me of [Pixies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies) and [Graham Coxon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Coxon)'s later solo-stuff. This first single off that album, "Grey Will Fade", was actually released for free.

10\. **Bonde Do Role** - "James Bonde"

Before [Marina left the band](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1384), she helped turn it out and make it really memorable. This is a good example of the beats and voice of the band at their most minimalistic.

11\. **Refused** - "The Refused Party Program"

Swedish hardcore legends Refused made their albums without any sense of how to sell it; it's not that they _tried_, but didn't want capitalism to rule.

12\. **Aphex Twin** - "73-yips"

I actually bought [the single "On"](http://www.discogs.com/release/3664) on vinyl because of the strength of [the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RBnRLp9LM) (directed by [Jarvis Cocker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis_Cocker)), and this is one of the b-sides. To say this track disturbed me during my first listen would be a slight understatement.

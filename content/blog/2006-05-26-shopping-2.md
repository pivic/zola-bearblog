Today was shopping day as my monthly salary came. And went.

First, I found a pair of brilliant [oki-ni Gazelle Laser](http://www.oki-ni.com/isroot/okini/Productimage/alt/au050a_005_1.jpg "Very nice, available through oki-ni.com") shoes at [Nitty Gritty](http://www.nittygritty.se), but the trick was, you couldn't buy them there. You had to go to above link and get them through there. No sweat. They actually look a lot better in real life than on the site; the soles are very cobolt-blue and the laser-made stitching makes the simple embroidery look fantastic (i.e. not pressed down as they become when done through regular stitching, or so I'm told) but despite their looking fantastic, the best part was the _feel_. Oh Bog.

Little more than a year ago, while visiting Mikaela's relatives in Spain, I got hold of a couple of shoes of [this model by Camper](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-25-camper3.jpg "Flatfoot."). Having worn them for a month my feet started to go haywire, as the soles were flat; if I had been walking without shoes I'd have been better off.

So I kept that in mind as I purchased a couple of Timberlands for the winter-season. The soles were excellent, but the "roof" of the shoes were not: the holes where the laces go through hurt the tops of my feet so bad (not due to my tying the laces too hard, I assure you) so that's another aspect I thought of when trying out said Gaselles.

So I'm replacing [my old Dockers](http://www.niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-11-26/images/PICT0001_edited.jpg "Them old shoes.") with Gaselles I just ordered, and I bought [this pair of secondary summer shoes](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-05-26-shoes.jpg "New shoes! New shoes! Leo wants new shoes!") at [Herr Judit](http://www.judits.se/judits.html). I also got [this Disco Dave-shirt](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-05-26-shirt.jpg) from the same place.

[![Mikaela's new shoes](http://static.flickr.com/78/153738136_2933630cc5_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=153738136) While out walking, Mikaela saw a pair of wonderful shoes and fell in love with them, but as she's not working full-time I decided to buy them for her; John chipped in as well and Mikaela nearly cried because of the altruism, but believe me, those shoes look great on her and she should have them, so they're hers now. Ha.

I got myself a large [Moleskine ruled notebook](http://www.moleskine.com/eng/_interni/catalogo/Cat_int/catalogo_notebooks.htm); it feels brilliant and looks even better. By the way, their new [City Notebook](http://www.moleskine.com/eng/_interni/city/default.htm) looks like a brilliant thing when travelling (to a city they cover). I also got [a 0.5mm liquid gel ink-pen](http://www.epinions.com/content_95992385156).

We also got hold of bread from Rival, a champagne ([Billecart-Salmon Brut RÃ©serve](http://www.winestar.com.au/prod819.htm)) for tomorrow, when we will be making pizza with Frederic and John, I got [the latest issue of The Fader](http://www.thefader.com/fader/current_issue) and Mikaela bought [a mandolin](http://fantes.com/images/16018-1slicers_mandolin.jpg).

Now tired. Now stop blogging.

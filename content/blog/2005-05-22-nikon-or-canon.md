[This picture](http://wvs.topleftpixel.com/archives/photos_people/050522_1163.shtml) clearly illustrates why I'm even considering buying the Canon 350D instead of the Nikon D70; but I'm quite sure I will buy the Nikon. Well, it's 75-25 to the advantage of Nikon.

**update**: on the other hand, [this blog](http://www.ferociouscheese.com) shows clear advantages with the D70. It's going to be a D70. And I think I might order it on Thursday. Ah, these bloody rich-kid problems.

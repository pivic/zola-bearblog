While people regurgitate The Stone Roses' third coming ((Pun definitely intended.)) as being The Bomb, I pause and feel it's refreshing to see another band from roughly the same era and geographic location make themselves useful by releasing new material, written by Albarn exclusively for the band's coming Hyde Park show.

Enter **[Blur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blur_%28band%29)**.

There's a new single out, "**Under The Westway**", from where two songs are premiered.

First, "_Under The Westway_":

I really like "_Under The Westway_", a saddish song with a strong melody and a kind of ring to it that makes me think of the band's old songs "_Sing_" and "_The Universal_" as well as...their ability to write memorable tracks. Coxon on slide guitar? Yes, please.

And there's "_The Puritan_", a much more electronic track. Dada feel! Thank you, thank you, thank you for not just delivering what everybody would expect from you while still retaining your style, guys.

Both tracks are refreshing; it's not nostalgia. I love how Coxon's guitar sounds with Albarn's voice. In short: really it's good to see them back.

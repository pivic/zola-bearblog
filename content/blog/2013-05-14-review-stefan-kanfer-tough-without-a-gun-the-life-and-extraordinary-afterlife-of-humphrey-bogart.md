[![Tough Without a Gun: The Life and Extraordinary Afterlife of Humphrey Bogart](http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1320518399m/9505808.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9505808-tough-without-a-gun)[Tough Without a Gun: The Life and Extraordinary Afterlife of Humphrey Bogart](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9505808-tough-without-a-gun) by [Stefan Kanfer](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10355.Stefan_Kanfer)  
My rating: [3 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/606982977)  
  
Humphrey Bogart grew up in a progressive family where his parents were successful. They did, however, not lavish him with much attention. Au contraire, Bogart grew up an anti-authorative thespian who played theater before becoming the world-famous movie star and icon that he is known as today.  
  
A libertine and man of his word - while it is argued that he was a serial adulterer - Bogart seems to have stayed true to his friends and work for as long as he lived. Half self destructive, half great at what he did, he believed in being a "man" and having a lot of fun.  
  
The book turns him out as a no-nonsense kind of guy who always went for the truth, except in his most alcoholic moments. It shows his ups and downs, and how he always turned around some really bad situations in his life.  
  
This book is straight-forward. There are no revelations in here, and the contents are put out chronologically in one simple way. There is no personal style to the writing, and towards the end I got the feeling that the author simply wanted to finish it off.  
  
There are a lot of enthralling stories on how Bogie and Hollywood worked in the 1940-1960s, not to mention some comparisons between the man and modern-day actors.

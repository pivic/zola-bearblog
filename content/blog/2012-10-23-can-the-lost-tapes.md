While listening to [Can](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band))'s recently released demo/obscurities collection "**The Lost Tapes**" I've found it either drives you mad or makes you think there'd be no Super Furry Animals, no David Holmes or enough experimental music. Just listen to "_Millionenspiel_" at the bottom.

Very inspiration. Great to play in the background at work.

> When the legendary Can studio in Weilerswist was sold to the German Rock N Pop Museum, they bought everything, including the army mattresses that covered the walls for sound protection, and relocated it to Gronau.
> 
> Whilst dismantling the studio, master tapes were found and stored in the Spoon archive. With barely legible labeling, no one was sure what was on these until Irmin Schmidt and long time collaborator Jono Podmore started to go through over 30 hours of music.
> 
> What they found was years of archived material, not outtakes, but rather tracks which had been shelved for a variety of reasons ““ soundtracks to films that were never released and tracks that didn't make it onto the final versions of albums due to space.

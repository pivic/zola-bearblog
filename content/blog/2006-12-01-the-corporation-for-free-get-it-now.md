[![The Corporation](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-12-02-thecorporation.png)](http://torrentfreak.com/sundance-winner-the-corporation-released-for-free-on-bittorrent)

Absolutely brilliant, the radiant documentary "[The Corporation](http://www.thecorporation.com)", has been released free of charge for anybody to download, very legal indeed! **_Get it now_**.

Check out everything about this, right [here](http://torrentfreak.com/sundance-winner-the-corporation-released-for-free-on-bittorrent).

I actually bought this gem on DVD when it came out, and I'm very happy owning it; it is one of the best documentaries on the global problem that faces the world when corporations get too much power, not only in the USA (where a corporation has the very same rights an individual has, believe it or not) but in the rest of the world, and how corporations benefit from not having to pay for "their" actions. Among the interviewees are [Noam Chomsky](http://www.chomsky.info), [Naomi Klein](http://www.nologo.org) and [Robert Hare](http://www.hare.org); believe me, there is a perfectly logical reason to why Mr. Hare is in this documentary.

From [Torrentfreak](http://torrentfreak.com) on the matter:

> The Corporation received more than 20 awards, including an audience award at the the prestigious Sundance Film Festival. The Film gives insight into the inner workings of large and powerful corporations, and how these affect our society.
> 
> The new torrent download includes a high-quality rip of the master DVD and a 40 minute interview with Joel Bakan, the author of the book and writer of the film. Mark Achbar actually dedicated a computer in his garage to do nothing but seed.
> 
> Although the torrent download is free, the filmmakers encourage people to donate a small fee if they like what they see.

After [my most recent bout with bad service and failing comeuppance](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1065) from my combattants, I love to see something that's working great: MOO have created [flickr MiniCards](http://www.moo.com/flickr), a service which allows a flickr-user to create small visiting card with a pretty picture on the reverse side, straight outta your collection of pictures.

Now, if you have a flickr pro-account and are one of the first 10000 to order, you can pick ten pictures, customise your contact-info, tweak your pictures a little before settling - and have those ten sent to your home for free!

I've just done so, and the service works great. I'm very satisfied with the whole experience, and even though visiting cards are falling behind services such as [Plaxo](http://plaxo.com) they are still valid in many a case.

I've got to direct much love to the gang (and mainly one individual in specific) for building [this web-interface](http://forum.utorrent.com/viewtopic.php?id=14565) for [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com), my favourite program for sharing content over the Internet, and you can pad it with [HTTPS](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html)! It's beta, but works wonderfully.

Speaking of great freeware, I just found [this page](http://www.multimedia.skolutveckling.se/scripts/view/frame.asp?i=33475) (Swedish only) where one can view and even download what seems to be quite great course-material on a variety of programs. I downloaded a course for IrfanView, which was available both in QuickTime and Windows Media, plus there was a complete PDF-file enclosed. I love it. The material is free to spread as long as you don't make money off it. Radiant, [Multimediabyr√•n](http://www.multimedia.skolutveckling.se).

I've missed getting happy from tech, since this business with inLife and Apple arose. By the way, I've now e-mailed both VP's again, this time about my experience yesterday, yet still no replies.

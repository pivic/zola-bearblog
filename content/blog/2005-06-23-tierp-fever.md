We've been to Tierp, where Staffan and Patrik own a holiday cottage. Right now they're in the middle of renovating the attic, so when they're not buying eight-inch nails or trying to get their attic flooring flush, they're...making lovely cake and dinner for us! [This gallery](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-06-23) of nearly 80 pictures will hopefully tell you more of our eventful journey, showing everything from animals (a spider, a dog and two socially maladjusted cats) to the truth about purchasing equipment for renovating in Gysinge (=bloody expensive).

Well in Tierp, we were treated with fantastic company, an amazing dinner and mostly great weather; a storm rose and thunder thrashed, making the ground rumble. At one point lightning must have hit merely a kilometer or so from where we stood. Everything electrical died at once, but the boys' cordless telephone lived on (as their former one did not). We had dinner in the pavillion where champagne and grilled food flowed. We listened to tapes from Patrik's youth (...), namely a radio-show called "Eldorado", which was extremely popular in the early eighties. Among Patrik's many tapes there were an alarming number by Bonnie Tyler and loads of disco. I guess you really can spot a person's sexuality early, huh? :-)


All in all, a very nice trip. Thanks, Staffan & Patrik!

The trip home took a lot longer than expected, as some sort of accident had occurred on the way home. Besides, travelling in a car with good seats would be one thing, but that Hyundai Atos of ours murders your back and everything attached to it. Enough complaining!

Once home I really wanted to see Dario Argento's "[Opera](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093677)", so I went to Wima's place and borrowed it. Mikaela and I watched it for a mere 45 minutes, but we were tired. See that one, if you feel the need for a bizarre horror-movie with cool music, which mostly doesn't fit in with what you're seeing, especially during and right after the murders.

Oh, not to forget, I made sure "If You Go Away" by Chicago stuck in Mikaela's mind [again](https://niklasblog.com/?p=664). Yes! Moahaha. On the other hand it stuck in mine as well, so I should just shut the hell up.

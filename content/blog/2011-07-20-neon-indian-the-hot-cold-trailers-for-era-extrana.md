OK, so Alan Palomo is releasing another album as [Neon Indian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Indian), come 2011-09-13. It's called "**Era Extraà±a**". So, anything good? Yeay!

The man's has been to Helsinki, where the album has been recorded, among other places. I'm not surprised if Wayne Coyne or other members of [The Flaming Lips](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips) are involved. Oklahoma and Texas, fancy that. Oklahoma City and Denton. But the above video is cold, cold Helsinki, and Alan's hand-written diary entries. Churches. And the damned Silja Line ferries that every Swede travels on to get drunk.

Yeah, there are two teaser trailers. Listen to that music and tell me that's not [Jan Hammer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hammer) in his prime. Oh fuck _him_, this is original music and _not_ bon mots. And it smells great. I'm not making shit up; if it's at all something like the first album - "**[Psychic Chasms](http://grooveshark.com/#/album/Psychic+Chasms/3583508)**" - it could very likely be something to trip out to and love, both for harmonies, the sense of having the music wash over you and then realise that the lyrics are funny and simple and the melodies actually make for playing the songs on guitar or piano and...there's so much to love. I feel like [Ferdinand the bull](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_qZmf9l-HC1A/SWkTzUytuYI/AAAAAAAACeM/kk76dG8ywYg/s400/FerdinandBull+0268b+5_960.jpg).

That's part two. There's a third part coming up, so go subscribe to [this](http://vimeo.com/gorillavsbear/videos) user's videos at Vimeo.

Too bad the man's only playing Emmabodafestivalen, a little music festival, when it comes to Sweden; please, do come back and play somewhere close to where you played last year at Popaganda. ((And I know he's reading this, as I'm hearing voices in my head say he does.))

Right now, his album and that of [jj](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jj_%28band%29) is the only coming stuff - off the top of my head - that I can say I'm really, really waiting for to be released.

Seriously, I laugh at [Die Antwoord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die%20Antwoord), a bunch of South African rappers who want to be hardcore, tattooed and using a lot of gabber tunes. But they've had a 16-minute short-film, "[Umshini Wam](http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_FS12304)", written and directed by [Harmony Korine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony%20Korine) and it's very good, at times bordering on genius.

Rappers in wheelchairs wearing fluorescent jumpsuits. That should count for having a sense of humor. The official explanation:

> Ninja and Yo-Landi are wheelchair-bound lovers and real gangstas. They live in the outskirts of civilization, they shoot guns for fun, smoke massive joints, and sleep in the woods. They don't have any bling to show for their gangsta cred, but the world deserves to know who they are. They're tramps, and their wheels are starting to fall off.

"Get up, Ninja! You're always so lazy! Get up! Get up! I need you, and you always leave me."

_I'm old enough to bleed I'm old enough to bleed I'm old enough to crack a brick through your teeth while you sleep_

Not to mention a camberwell carrot.

I can't stand the new album off Depeche Mode. It's god-awful, and I'm a person who loved "Violator" and almost everything they released before it. Since Alan Wilder left the group, they've gone crap, and this one's just the worst they've released. But not according to a bunch of (mostly American) critics. See what they have to say about it, [here](http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/depechemode/playingtheangel).

- Thinking it's time to cut down on a LOT of social networking that gives me NOTHING in return. I should have done this ages ago. [#](http://twitter.com/pivic/statuses/1726486029)
- Thinking it'll be strange to watch "Efterlyst" tonight, a national TV-show, partly about a former class-mate who is shot dead. [#](http://twitter.com/pivic/statuses/1719082588)
- Listening to The Courteeners' "Cavorting" on the way home. The sky's ill foreboding but I care not! Picture: [http://bkite.com/07cmL](http://bkite.com/07cmL) [#](http://twitter.com/pivic/statuses/1716843565)
- One film that I'd love to see turned into reality; Gondry, Clowes, Chappelle: [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412978](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412978) [#](http://twitter.com/pivic/statuses/1715840991)

- Laughing at "Svengali"; check 05:36 where Carl Bar√¢t's being hassled re. reuniting with Pete Doherty: [http://bit.ly/1FPwG](http://bit.ly/1FPwG) - hygiene away! [#](http://twitter.com/pivic/statuses/1705260037)

- Wishing there would be some way to avoid ass-cracks and fans of Metallica on the subway. Both? Impossible! [#](http://twitter.com/pivic/statuses/1696071719)
- I now know why everything I touch with my right hand partly feels like it's been dipped in flour: I've burned my right index fingertip. [#](http://twitter.com/pivic/statuses/1694589059)
- Working: reinstalling computers, reading up on Windows 7 and talking to users. I'm also hungry and won't see Eddie Izzard live in December. [#](http://twitter.com/pivic/statuses/1694153088)

Right in [Odenplan, Stockholm](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=59.3427778%2C18.0497222&hl=en&z=16&ie=UTF8), a few guys placed touch-sensitive materials over stairs located right next to an escalator, to see if plain fun could convert people. After the move, 66% of all people decided to use the stairs. Here's a film. Brilliant!

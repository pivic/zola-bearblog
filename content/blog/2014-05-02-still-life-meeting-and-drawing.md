Met Ida yesterday. Laughed, schemed, made some preliminary Mean Girls and HÃ¥kan plans. Played Bob outta Twin Peaks from behind red curtains as X snapped pics. We howled.

I found myself wanting to draw X, yesterday and the day before that. I don't usually draw, yet I somehow can't wait to do it more, to start using more colours. I just feel I wanna do it more! Catching the sun-tinted, curving lines over her clasped fingers with those delicately coloured fingernails softly spiking out against the softness of her skin; I long to put it on paper! The hair wetly curling from behind her ears - _"that's just temporary"_ - to cover the crossbars of her glasses as she exhales - how could I ever draw _that?_ - and a gasp of Berlin life flows into the air as her new vintage dress equally flows without physically moving. I leaped to quickly describe her eyes with my pen and less is more in that area where my drawing is concerned. I think I actually did it. I completed the drawings.

_I love you_ was whispered to me this morning, I rushed for you, as yes, she smelled lovely, of newly opened eyes that seemed to be filled with promise, fun and a smile that kills and fills me with life. I breathed her in and pulled myself away in order to go to work, which wasn't easy despite trying to make it so.

I haven't listened to Radiohead for quite a while. Going back is like pulling on a couple of old pants, worrying if they'll fit again and finding out that it still works, in fact, it feels like you last worn them yesterday. In a good way. Radiohead dedicated their album _The Bends_ to Bill Hicks. _My blood will thicken_, sings Thom Yorke.

I don't think my blood ever will. It's flowing too hard to stop now. Time to enter the office doors. Can't wait for the weekend to start. I hope the temperature reaches Berlin levels from the last weekend, when it was hot, hot, hot!

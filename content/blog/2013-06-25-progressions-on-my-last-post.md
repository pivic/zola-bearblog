I've received answers on [my last post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=13578)!

Here it is:

> **Sent: Tuesday, June 25, 2013 9:44 AM To: 'Niklas Pivic' Subject: RE: Toyota - HLLY market**
> 
> I can open the jpeg of the Black Tailed Gull. I can’t get the other open. So, I can say that a I a bit confused J

However, before I could reply to the above, I received this, sent to my e-mail domain (which means that it reaches me):

> Hi Carey,
> 
> I received a reply from a Niklas from Pivic, who apparently does not work there (see below)…… One attachment was a jpeg of a gull. The other attachment I could not open. STRANGE!!!!!!
> 
> Anyhow, I worked with Comcast and in broadcast so I am familiar with your TV planning. I wanted to explore radio with you. Do you have time available on 7-15 or 7-16? For lunch?
> 
> Let me know.

Well, now. Something had to be done. I wrote as follows:

> Hi Heather,
> 
> I've spoken with Carey. He asked me to reply to your e-mail. We have reached some conclusions:
> 
> While you successfully identified the gull, you didn't analyse it. There is a valuable clue left in the picture of the gull, and, actually, in the other picture.
> 
> The following is very important, should you really wish to explore radio with Carey. We have identified three things that will happen to you; if they prove to come true, please let me know, and I will forward the first picture to you again for your analysis:
> 
> 1\. There is a man in a smiling bag.
> 
> 2\. The owls are not what they seem.
> 
> 3\. Without chemicals, he points.
> 
> Cheers, and good luck,
> 
> Niklas

I really wonder what will come out of this.

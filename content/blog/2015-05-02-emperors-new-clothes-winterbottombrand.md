"_This is what we've come to expect as normal, and it doesn't have to be._"

"[**The Emperor's New Clothes**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes_%282015_film%29)" is a new documentary out by **[Michael Winterbottom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Winterbottom)** with **[Russell Brand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Brand)** as the leading narrator. It deals mainly with the UK, but also the USA and - naturally - with the world, seeing that 80 people (!) are in control of 50% of all the money on the Earth. Of which 25 trillion US dollars remain untouched.

When a cleaner earns 300 times less than their boss, things are wrong. Especially as the 1% of people who make the most, reap the biggest benefits, and the others are getting more and more marginalised; they pay most of the taxes (while many millionaires do not pay anything, neither do their companies, e.g. Starbucks and Boots).

Tax evasion and economic crime goes unpunished, and more so by every day, while "ordinary people" get locked up for a year when they've snatched up some juice during riots.

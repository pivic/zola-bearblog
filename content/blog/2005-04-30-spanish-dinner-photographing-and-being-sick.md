Last night Frederic, Staffan and Patrik came by for a Spanish dinner which Mikaela and I hosted. Mikaela made all of the food, and among the culinary treasures there was: tortilla, chorizo, jamà³n de Serrano, salads, peasant bread, bean-pot with chorizo, two kinds of cheese, three different Rioja wines (all quite different in taste, acidity, age, spice, texture and bouquet), home-made sangrà­a, olive-oil-and-garlic-infused paprika (which was first grilled in the oven and then had the peel removed). All very nice. Frederic said the tortilla was the best he's ever eaten, I say it was better than those we ate in Madrid, and Staffan and Patrik also liked the food a lot. Cheers to Mikaela for everything!

Of course, there were pictures. I drove everybody insane from photographing everything. I've already asked everybody's forgiveness, so yeh, like, shut up, but no, like, yeh, anyway, [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-04-29-preps) are the pictures taken while preparing the dishes (taken with my Minolta Dimage E323) and [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-04-29--2005-04-30) are the pictures from yesterday evening (taken with Fred's Nikon D70). Quite a world of difference in quality. Among the second bunch of pictures are a lot of experimental ones taken at home and right outside our apartment. I felt so ill today (_not_ due to a hang-over, which I was not even afflicted by) I couldn't venture far, but managed to shoot a few good pictures anyway. It's hard to get the hang of all the functions of the camera, but that's also because I'm very new to the more advanced bits of digital photography. After erasing appx. 95% of the pictures I took yesterday, among the few who made it through the massacre, two were found that I couldn't remember taking. True! Staffan had taken them. He's actually a photographer, and owns a Nikon D70, so there you are.

Mikaela had her hair cut by Nicola today. Fringed! Check out pictures of her hair among the second bunch I just linked to.

I'll stop being incoherent now and slump down into the sofa. Mikaela just mentioned my tea's gone cold, and we've got five boxes of old clobber we're boxing down to the basement. Ciao, and remember: stay healthy. Being sick just sucks.

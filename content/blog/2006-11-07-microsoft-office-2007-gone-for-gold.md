Yep, the biggest revamp of MS Office has finally gone gold, which means no more changes are made to the code that make up the product before it gets slammed onto CD's and becomes downloadable. Read more about it [here](http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/office2007_gallery_01.asp), where you'll also catch a screen-shot gallery. [Some](http://www.winsupersite.com/images/showcase/office2007_rtm_02.jpg) of the new icons scare me, but all in all I'm looking forward to this update.

It'll be launched 2006-11-30, and a 60-day trial-version will (according to MS) be downloadable through [their MS Office-site](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/default.aspx) on 2006-12-01.

For all of you wondering, Windows Vista is "99% ready" before going gold. That's a quote from Microsoft.

**edit**: [this](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/office2007/iworker/default.mspx) is the learning portal that Microsoft wants to push for Office 2007; it's sporting [a good PDF](http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/5/a/35a8cb9f-1349-4645-ac2a-49ba61834826/First-Look-2007-Microsoft-Office-System.pdf) (that's free right now, so go download it) plus free e-learning courses. Get!

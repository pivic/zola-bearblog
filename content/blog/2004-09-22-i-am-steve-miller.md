![I am Steve Miller. But better-looking, of course.](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-09-23-stevemiller.jpg)So apparently, I'm Steve Miller.

There's a martial arts dude who looks a lot like me. Weird! He's like a dwarfed martial arts master version of me. A Mini-Me who'd Maxi-Kick me if he'd get the chance. However, I might win as I'd probably get the better of him to start with:

me: "Gimme all your money!" he: "Whut?" me: \[roundkick , sidekick, slapstick\] he: "Arrgh, you win."

- **[hapax legomenon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon)**. A hapax legomenon (pl. _hapax legomena_, though sometimes called hapaxes for short) is a word which occurs only once in the written record of a language, in the works of an author, or in a single text. If a word is used twice it is a _dis legomenon_, thrice, a _tris legomenon_. Beyond _tetrakis legomenon_ (four times), a word is not rare enough to note.

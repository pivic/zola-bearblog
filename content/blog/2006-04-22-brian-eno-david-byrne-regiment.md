![Eno! Byrne! Ghosts!](http://bushofghosts.wmg.com/images/rotate_home/rotate.php)A modified copy of [my writing from Allconsuming](http://www.allconsuming.net/item/view/246516):

Brian Eno had a sabbatical in Thailand, where he went listening to voices from different cultures while finding out what he wanted to do in the future.

Well, he came back to England, spoke with David Byrne about making music together (apart from their producing together, for Talking Heads, Byrne's seminal punk-outfit) and made this album, a true classic.

The album combines tape-loops of American exorcists, Muslim women chanting, loads of other voices to boot, poly-rhythmic beats staggering beautifully over layers of music produced using traditional rock-instruments. This is bliss. It works its way into your sub-conscious (as was proved when Oliver Stone incorporated loads of it in the film "[Wall Street](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291)") and it's fantastically fitting, dispite of the narrow elements of the film.

Yes, the track "Qu'ran" is missing from the remastered album, and [here is the reason](http://www.tenthousand.org/?p=172). It's also available on ye olde edition (and through the Internet). In what I hope will be a matter of a week or so, the album will be available through a [Creative Commons-license](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/03/30/byrneeno_bush_of_gho.html), meaning you will be able to download bits of it to make your own music and distribute it, under certain conditions. [The site](http://bushofghosts.wmg.com) will bare all.

The track I'm offering you, "[Regiment](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-04-22-regiment.mp3)", doesn't tell you how the album is as a whole, as it's comprised of tracks sharing a mere few things: they're experimental, rhythmic, multi-cultural and brought together by sharp musical minds. It's like reading history and philosophy without it ever getting boring. Get [the album](http://bushofghosts.wmg.com)!

As usual, the track will be deleted after a week.

When I'm feeling scared and am in an argument with someone, I always try to talk, which is good, but when the person I'm talking with (temporarily) turns silent, an irrational fear tells me that silence = bad, talk = good, which makes me go on and on about what I think the other person feels, what I feel, going back and forth like between those modes almost panic-like, just ending up with me plugging up the other person, turning the dialogue into a monologue. That's doing bad. Really bad.

Talking a lot, saying nothing. Damaging.

Nothing but stopping the words and trampling the heart of the person I love the most. That's in no way respectful.

Silence isn't bad!

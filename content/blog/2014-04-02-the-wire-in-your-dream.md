X's asleep and talking.

**X, in a sad, slow voice**: Would it be OK if we never see the very last episode of "[The Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire)"?

**Me**: What, why?

**X, in high-pitched voice that gets higher by the second**: Because then it will really, _really_ be over!

**Me, startled**: Darling! What's the matter? Are you sad?

**X, in a ridiculously high-pitched voice**: No, I just speak this way right now!

![Richard Ramirez](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrn8wzq8xE1qhgc3go1_500.jpg "Richard Ramirez")

As [I just read a book](https://niklasblog.com/?p=8619) on [Richard Ramirez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ramirez), I found a few bits of interest:

A video interview with Richard Ramirez is found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC5huwZoPZA).

The first part of a five-part documentary is found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nAfxZlu6AA).

> **Ramirez**: I guess you could say like...the balances of the mind, the chemistry, the psyche of a killer“”a wolf in sheep's clothing, and he has learned to perfect it. Uh...this is a guy you think it'd be okay to go to his house, have a drink, and smoke a joint, but it would be your last drink because you'd find yourself handcuffed and the next thing you know, this guy would be eating you. This is a very...uh...very interesting thing to look at in life. These types of individuals...because they're extra-ordinary. It's sort of like a strange car, a strange house. You ask yourself, "How was it built? How did it get here?" I've always been fascinated with killers, and crime, and murder, and death. I suppose I started when I was twelve years old (the murder of Jessie by Richard's cousin Mike). I started reading crime detective magazines and stuff like this and even the pages had a certain scent to them, a certain smell to them. It was very strange; it gave me a strange feeling.

> **Carlo**: Can you explain the feeling?
> 
> **Ramirez**: Strange, because I had experienced the death of people I knew at an early age. I was four or five years old when I knew about a death of a friend of my father's. Then when I was nine I went to my grandfather's funeral. It's just...death had a very profound effect on me when I saw it. Death of my dog, death of a pet animal“”just death.
> 
> **Carlo**: Do you feel that there's a life after death, that there really is a Heaven and Hell?
> 
> **Ramirez**: I couldn't say for sure what there is, you know? I can't sit here and tell you, "Yes, there's this or that," because I'm not sure. I can only speculate.
> 
> **Carlo**: Well, what do you speculate?
> 
> **Ramirez**: I think there is...uh...a divine force that is out there. I also believe there's a malevolent force that is out there. Then again, they could be one and the same. I also believe some in reincarnation. I mean, how do these child prodigies come about? A young child being able to play the piano very well at the age of three years old...everything is open. I have an open mind.
> 
> **Carlo**: Do you feel that evil can be reincarnated?
> 
> **Ramirez**: I hope so. \[laughs\]

If you need to quickly assemble a "flash brochure" and you've used a standard word-processor once or twice, you'll probably fare well with [formatpixel](http://formatpixel.com); this is an online, flash-driven tool which you use to make your brochure. So, what does it create?

I made [this](http://www.formatpixel.com/pivic/1850) brochure.

As I was creating it, I discovered a few things that troubled me:

**1**. While one can align pictures to the top left part of a double-page, one cannot align them to sit snugly to the right part. Just check page three for an example. **2**. Some objects, mainly text-boxes, refuse to snap to grids _at times_. Check out page two to see the text-box; it's supposed to snap to the edge of the picture as with the dog on the right, but hell no. **3**. Spelling-errors. For instance, while displaying the pictures, the title reads "Format Pixel". Formatpixel is a one-person-company, and one does not have to be a detective to see that spelling-errors can easily mean other, hidden problems, if the developer isn't dyslexic. I mean, if somebody doesn't care about details...what else could be wrong?

Otherwise, the product is very interesting! I like the easy drag-and-drop-interface, the quick way you get around the GUI and the rest as well.

You get 512KB to play around with for a free accound, and you pay for the rest. If I were a graphic designer, illustrator, artist, photographer, et.c. I'd think about using this to show off my stuff.

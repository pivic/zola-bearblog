I've just tasted the first coffee that I got in [my MistoBox](https://niklasblog.com/?p=13487) ((I'm still unsure whether I dislike the name, or hate it. _Misty Box_. Surely, it's not _mystery box_.))

[Coava Coffee Roasters](http://coava.myshopify.com) are reputable. However, this coffee isn't my thing, really. The coffee is really well roasted, not too dark or roasted for my taste at all, but the taste leaves a sour tang on the tongue, and I'm not a big fan of [Yirgacheffe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgachefe).

The downside of the MistoBox is that the coffee was roasted a month ago. That's no time in comparison with places like your average store-bought coffee, but in comparison with the locality of some roasters, for instance [Drop Coffee](http://dropcoffee.com), some would argue that this affects flavour and other components.

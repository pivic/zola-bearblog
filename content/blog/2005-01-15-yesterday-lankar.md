Yesterday I finished the first working week after my holidays, which was hell. I can't remember when I last worked that hard, and everything's just mounting. It's exhausting at work, but still, I get a very intense feeling of pleasure when I get gratitude from the users. They're the ones we're doing it for. Some times I feel like I'll (some time in the future) start a company designed to train and educate support personnel, and that I'd make a bundle of money off that. Most support people in Sweden, or people working in service, don't realise they're getting their money from the people they help, directly or in-directly. They mostly don't act that way.

After work, I stopped by SöderCheesen, a good cheese shop with and awful name (translates to "TheSouthCheese" as the shop's on the south side of town, yet the Swedish name carries a very "folky idiot" twang to it that is not possible to translate well, not for me, anyway), and bought two very well-aged cheeses, a manchego and an appenzeller. I also picked up a moldy lump from Spain, called Azul. I also got some pastrami turkey from Ingelsta Kalkon, a very fine shop when all things turkey are involved.

I went home, where Mikaela was grilling some vegetables and had made a nice salad with a vinegar-garlic-dressing to boot. I poured the Fetzer Barrel Select Zinfandel we had over into a couple of glasses, and we ate her prepared food with the cheese and turkey, which was very nice. Pictures of that are available [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-01-15).

Also available there, is a little bit of renovation magic that Mikaela added to our apartment. She used a bit of wallpaper to cover up the front of one of our shoe-storage boxes that's right next to the entrance of the apartment, and it looks great.

After she did that, we checked out "[Beat Street](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086946/combined)", a film I haven't seen in more than 10 years. It's a very early film about some kids loving the hip-hop movement while they're busy growing up. It's full of clichés and still works quite good. The Swedish director Staffan Hildebrandt has probably stolen loads off it to the Swedish 80's film "G - Som i Gemenskap", a film that's absolutely bursting with clichés, but then again, isn't one's teen years filled with that in a lot of aspects?

If you're Swedish and morbid, check [this picture](http://surl.se/bilder4/4499.jpg) out.

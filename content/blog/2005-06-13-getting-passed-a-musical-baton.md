[Nao passed me](http://blog.detlog.org/?p=11) a "musical baton", so here's my deal:

**Total volume of music files on my computer**: 324GB, at least. It's semi-difficult to say.

**The last CD I bought**: My latest bought CD is the soundtrack to "[Devdas](http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/07/02/devdas_2002_review.shtml)".

**Song playing right now**: [Primal Scream](http://www.theprimalscream.com)'s cover of [The Clash](http://www.angelfire.com/on/clash)'s "[Know Your Rights](http://www.angelfire.com/on/clash/jk.html#Know%20Your%20Rights)". Bobby Gillespie's repeating the phrase "know your rights" is worth the double price of the single.

**Five songs I listen to a lot, or that mean a lot to me**: I'll just paste and somewhat tweak the top songs off [my Audioscrobbler page](http://audioscrobbler.com/user/pivic):

1\. Morrissey - "It's Hard To Walk Tall When You're Small" 2. Pixies - "Winterlong" 3. Super Furry Animals - "Ice Hockey Hair" 4. Rage Against the Machine - "Sleep Now In The Fire" 5. Elliott Smith - "Pretty (Ugly Before)"

**Five people to whom I'm passing the baton**: Actually, drably enough, I won't be passing it to anybody; I know fewer than five people who run a blog.

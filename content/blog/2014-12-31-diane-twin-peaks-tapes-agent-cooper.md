Not the most expected New Year's post, I guess, but it's necessary a bizarre one. If you're into Twin Peaks, that is.

Listen, in 1990 there was a cassette tape ordered by David Lynch and Mark Frost, that would consist of Agent Cooper's talking to Diane, the supposed recipient of the messages he speaks into a dictaphone. The dialogue which is not pulled from the TV series is written by [Scott Frost](http://braddstudios.com/2012/01/20/scott-frost-talks-twin-peaks). The cassette is 45 minutes in total, not available in any other formats, but some weird, nice beings have transferred the whole thing to digital media for us to enjoy. Or just weird out to. The entire recording is available at the bottom in a YouTube clip.

Bar the Twin Peaks theme, the cassette starts off with Cooper having bought the dictaphone and then ventures with background sounds wherever he is - in an airport, with Sheriff Harry S. Truman, in a morgue - it's interesting, even though I'll confess to not having heard the entire cassette. Below you'll find two sound clips. The one on top is the first talking clip as mentioned and the second from the top is Cooper entering Twin Peaks. The last one finds some delightful Cooper comments, for example "Serial killers don't kill their girlfriends".

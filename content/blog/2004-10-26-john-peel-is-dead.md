John Peel, world-famous radio DJ, [has passed away](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/news/altnews/041026_john_peel.shtml).

For you who don't know who he is and consider yourselves in love with music - READ UP. The man was directly responsible for the careers of Pulp, The Fall, The Undertones and made a lot of great music sound throughout the airwaves for decades. Ever since he first started broadcasting radio, actually from a boat during the flower-power days when he illegally broadcast Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix, he's been at the forefront of music, continually pushing new groups, checking what happens and has had ideas, thoughts and a very active mind of his own.

I remember getting The Smiths' "Peel Sessions" and loved it. I remember thanking him for bringing Pulp to the world - he heard their demo and actually saved them from disbanding by playing them on his show and giving them the push they needed - and also for letting me hear The Undertones for the first time ever. Mind you, his favourite single of all time was their "Teenage Kicks".

Here's to you, Mr. Peel.

> [On my first day in New York, I posted Xeroxes all over downtown Manhattan, looking for an inexpensive loft. One day I noticed someone else’s ad: “A painter wishes to share a darkroom equipped loft with another artist.” I rushed to the nearest phone. “Hello,” a woman’s voice answered. “Hello. I’m a photographer from Boston and I saw your ad.” “Are you allergic to cats?” “No. I don’t think so. You have a cat?” “Do I ever!” #dogsofinstagram#fineartphotography#stories#artphoto#contemporaryphotography#blackandwhite#newyorkcity](https://www.instagram.com/p/BT2O6zxhDFB/)

I love Tony Mendoza's cat photographs. [Tony's book on Ernie](http://www.tonymendozaphoto.com/ernie), the cat that pops up in most of the pics on this page, is excellent! Check out that link as some of the pics on that page are superior to these below, which are embedded from Tony's Instagram page.

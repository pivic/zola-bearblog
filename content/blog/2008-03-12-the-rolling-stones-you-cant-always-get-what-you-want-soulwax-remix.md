![Soulwax](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-03-12-soulwax.jpg)[Soulwax](http://www.soulwax.com), a.k.a. The Dwaele Brothers, a.k.a. 2 Many DJs, have officially remixed The Rolling Stones' old tune for the soundtrack to the film "[21](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478087)". I guess the film's going to be trite, but this remix is fair; it's turned a rock-feast into a tight, slowdancing, electronic little LCD Soundsystem-wafting number.

This lot is known for their great remixes, of which a lot are assembled on [this album](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Most-Remixes-Soulwax/dp/B000WFFCTC) which I recommend warmly, even though their masterpiece (this far) remains "[As Heard On Radio Soulwax Pt. 2](http://2manydjs.free.fr/articles.php?lng=en&pg=34)".

This track will be gone in a week. Enjoy!

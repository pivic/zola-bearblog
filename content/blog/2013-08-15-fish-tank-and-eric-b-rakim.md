I really like the film named "**[Fish Tank](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1232776)**". An English modern great film, filled with everyday life, dreams, realities and just everyday beauty, it's a great recommendation.

One of the things that stuck with me from the film are the scenes from it where X, the lead character, dances to [**Eric B. & Rakim**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_B._%26_Rakim). I love their music. I love the dancing scenes. There's a bit of it in the above video, which is a snippet that The Criterion Collection have made to show the film's coolness. "_[Know The Ledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_the_Ledge)_" is such a strong track and there's something that resonates deep in myself when I watch the vid above and see X dancing to "Ledge" as though her life depended on it.

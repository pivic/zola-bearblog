Seriously, this is the best critique of [SOPA](https://niklasblog.com/?p=9450) that I've seen so far, and I strongly recommend watching the below video for a "what the hell, the government can't do that!" moment and hopefully a laugh. The examples in the video are impeccable.

Another little example of how humor can be used to educate.

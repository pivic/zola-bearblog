Today I got myself a [D-Link USB Bluetooth adapter](http://www.dlink.com/products/?model=DBT-120) for my stationary computer, enabling me to connect my laptop to the Internet: no cables required! The sole reason I'd like to have a wireless network adapter would be that the [Sony PSP](http://www.us.playstation.com/psp.aspx) (released 2005-09-01 in Sweden) uses one to connect to other players on the Internet, but I really hope somebody gets bluetooth running through that little sucker.

I'm happy that we no longer have a long ethernet cord running through our apartment. This is an instance where wireless networking really rocks, for instance giving me the ability to just glance over my shoulder to check a recipe online while cooking it, or just reading one's e-mail on a Sunday afternoon while laying in bed.

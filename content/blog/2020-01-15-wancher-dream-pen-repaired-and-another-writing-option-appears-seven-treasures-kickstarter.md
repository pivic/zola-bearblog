One of Wancher's artisans applying lacquer to a Dream Pen.

My [Wancher Dream Pen](https://niklasblog.com/?p=23563) went on a little repair excursion to Japan recently, after I found out that writing with the [Wancher Dream Pen Zogan](https://niklasblog.com/?p=23920) felt like using a hot knife through butter!

Wancher's Nib Master—that's the actual title—ground it down a little, which added two more options that are visible in the image below:

1. This is the regular writing style I use; I lightly press and that produces a fairly thin line. Mind you, since the nib was altered, the default line is a bit wider than before, but I knew this, and Wancher's brilliant support contact—Handa, what a person!—did tell me about this before the alteration took place.
2. This is a notably thicker line, and I should point out that I shouldn't have written 'hard', it's just a tad harder than usual.
3. Written by holding the pen upside-down, just as with a Pelikan Souverän.

I'd no idea that grinding the nib (in the way that Wancher's Nib Master did) would bring about the ability for me to write upside-down and produce what I can only say amounts to an extra-fine line! What an extra!

I love it. So yes, I'm taking turns at writing regularly and upside-down.

It's also notable that ink now flows more freely than before it was altered. Perhaps this is due to something other than the nib alteration, as Wancher had to put the nib together with the pen as I completely messed up their instructions to only send them the nib; I knew I'd make a dog's dinner out of constructing the pen again, so they were kind enough to do it for me.

Check this wild shit out!

Wancher is launching [another Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wancher/seven-treasures/), this time for their **Seven Treasures fountain pen**!

The pen is made from bakelite material and hand-crafted with Japanese traditional Shippoyaki art by a nationally-recognized Shippoyaki artist - Okagaki Yukie.

Seven Treasures are also the seven precious ingredients which are used to create shippo artwork; they are gold, silver, emerald, coral, agate,?  
giant clamshell, glass and pearl. This might vary among different designs.?

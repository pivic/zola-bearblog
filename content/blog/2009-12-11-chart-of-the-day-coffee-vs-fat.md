I love how the chart below shows how many calories there are per caffeine amount, e.g. a black caffeinated cup of coffee, as compared with other products, e.g. a glass of wine, french fries, a Big Mac and...the [Starbucks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks "Starbucks") products.

Be sure you don't miss the following quote from [this old post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=738) of mine, culled from the best - and only - book on fat that I've ever read, namely [Fat ““ The Anthropology Of An Obsession](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585423866?tag=niklasblog-20):

> Two new products, the Strawberries & Crà¨me Frappuccino Blended Crà¨me and the Double Chocolate Chip Frappuccino Blended Crà¨me recently earned the “Food Porn of the Month Award“ from the Center for the Science in the Public Interest's (CPSI) Nutrition Action Healthletter. Past winners of this award include the Coconut Crà¨me Frappuccino and the Vanilla Crà¨me Frappucino. This award is not for the best hard-core food ad but for food products the CPSI considers to be impressively unhealthy. A 20-ounce venti of either of these products has over 600 calories and while the Strawberries & Crà¨me has 7 grams of fat, the Double Chocolate Chip Frappuccino contains 16 grams of fat. (Venti means “really big“ for those not fluent in American coffee café Italian). Neither drink actually contains coffee; the Nutrition Action Healthletter calls them “fattuccinos“ ““ more like milk shakes than coffee.

Finally, a homosexual couple wins an important legal battle. [Here](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1298&a=407355&previousRenderType=6)'s an article about it \[in Swedish\]. During one night in the summer of 2003, a Swedish woman and her girl-friend entered Fridhem, a restaurant in Stockholm. The couple kissed while in the restaurant, after which the owner asked them to leave. Feeling frustrated, one of the women asked why. The owner said the women were disturbing the order. In-court, the owner said he would have told a heterosexual couple the same thing, should they have kissed in his restaurant. After having the case dismissed in district court, the court of appeal has found the owner of the restaurant guilty of discrimination.

Two interesting aspects of this case is that the owner 1) in district court said he normally allowed guests to hug and kiss and 2) could not show how the signs of affection by the couple in court differed from those of his other restaurant guests.

You have to read [63 Days](http://www.63days.com). Synopsis from the site:

> In the 80's, "boot camps" for troubled teens became the new treatment dejour for parents at their wits end. However, after numerous allegations of severe abuse, untrained staff and several deaths, these camps came under much scrutiny. Steve Cartisano ran the most notorious of these camps, called Challenger Foundation. I was 15 when I was kidnapped from my bed and taken to Challenger. 63 Days is the story-in-progress about my brutal experiences there, my subsequent escape and the aftermath.

To something completely different, the [Sugar Bush Squirrel](http://www.sugarbushsquirrel.com/index.html). It's a squirrel. Go ahead. It's work-safe as well as utterly insane.

Now I've started to use the [Avatar Popup](http://frenchfragfactory.net/ozh/my-projects/wordpress-plugin-avatar-gravatar-popup) plug-in for Wordpress. This is a plug-in that displays pictures when moving your cursor over certain words. It seems to be working very well for me, unlike previous ones. It'll work for those of you who run CSS-compliant browsers (e.g. Mozilla and Firefox are OK, Internet Explorer is not).

Writing about WordPress-plug-ins, I'm now also trying [Bad Behavior](http://www.ioerror.us/software/bad-behavior), with which I'm trying to sort out the weeds of spam. Synopsis from the site:

> Bad Behavior is a set of PHP scripts which prevents spambots from accessing your site by analyzing their actual HTTP requests and comparing them to profiles from known spambots. It goes far beyond User-Agent and Referer, however.

So, if you're trying to comment something on this page, and you receive a page [similar to this one](http://www.ioerror.us/software/bad-behavior/412-precondition-failed), let me know!

Thanks to Rion, I've just learned what [ketai culture](http://rion.nu/v5/archive/000920.php) is about.

I'm looking for a digital system camera. Which to pick, which to pick? [Nikon D70s or Canon EOS 350D](http://www.digitalreview.ca/cams/NikonD50vsD70SvsXT.shtml)?

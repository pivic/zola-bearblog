> It's the end of the year I have just settled here

Well, that was the tune of last year. It's been almost a year since Mikaela and I moved here, almost a year since I started this blog and it's been lovely, really. I can't ask for a better life companion than Mikaela. Our relationship is really what I've been wishing for, and I got more. She's a fireball constantly in motion, even when sitting down, a source of intellectual inspiration, humor and...will probably forever carry a special place in her heart for romantic comedies plus bad soaps and reality shows on TV. I love you, Mikaela.

Yesterday we went to Frederic, after Mikaela had a few talks with her grandmother, who is currently in hospital, having undergone surgery. A few days after christmas, she suffered a heart attack, yet made it quite well, but as she's a very negative person (as opposed to my grandmother, who's older (92 years old now) and very positive) who constantly speaks of dying as a good thing, tries to play Mikaela against her mother and vice versa (in some ways), she can be an extreme pain in the ass; not for me, but for Mikaela. That's horrible to see. At times she's positive and nice, which is wonderful, but mostly she's negative. Anyway, Mikaela decided not to go out with Frederic and me as she felt she had to pick up her grandmother this morning, should a doctor give her permission to go.

Before we went, though, Frederic had us and Finn, one of his dearest friends, over for dinner. Mikaela and he had shopped a few very nice cheeses ([taleggio](http://www.teddingtoncheese.co.uk/acatalog/descr/ph323lg.jpg), [brie](http://www.deliaonline.com/picturelibrary/jpeg150/br/brie-de-meaux01.jpg), [appenzeller](http://www.schweizerbrot.ch/images/bildarchiv/kaese/12_Appenzeller.jpg) and [manchego](http://www.kaeseleckerland.de/onlineshop/images/medium/manchego.jpg)) and meats (of which I love the [Jamà³n Serrano](http://www.consorcioserrano.com/in/informacion/tecnica_archivos/el_jamon.jpg) the most). To this, we drank red wine, cognac and drinks. Very nice!

Mikaela and Finn went home, and Frederic and I went to Cattelins, where we celebrated the new year by standing in line outside the place. A few French people stood just behind us in the queue, very surprised at there being very few places open in Sweden on New Year's Eve: "We thought...Sweden was the gay capital of the world!" - Sorry to break the news to you, lad! Maybe you should have checked stuff out before heading to a different country? Anyway they were nice, we all cheered and went inside in a few minutes, thank gawd. When inside, the wardrobe guy looked familiar. Hans! I seldom meet him at other places than gay, and I noted that he'd lost a lot of weight. "40 pounds. But I have six more to go!".

We ordered the only sort of champagne the place had, and were served by a bartender supreme. She was extremely quick! What service! Anyway, we headed into the place and spoke with people, had a good time, drank drinks and I drank quite little. While Frederic was downing 6's (i.e. drinks containing 6 centiliters of vodka) I downed water. Things were calm on the way home and I got there appx. 03:30.

Today I've been waking up all day. It's now 14:57 and I'm eating an orange marmalade sandwich listening to Eric B. & Rakim's "[Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002O75/002-3038365-3379200?v=glance)", one of the best hip-hop albums ever made. So what's the picture with this post? It's the cover picture of [Lemon Jelly](http://www.lemonjelly.ky TARGET=)'s coming album, "'64-'95", referring to the span in years of the various samples they've used. They're an amazing, slow, electronic, funny and danceable group. Check out their first album, "[Lost Horizons](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:isjb7ia4g7or)". It's marvellous.

Now I'll wait for Mikaela to come home. My little love in size she may be, yet she's the greatest love there is.

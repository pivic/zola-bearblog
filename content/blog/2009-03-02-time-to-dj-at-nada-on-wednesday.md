Come Wednesday, I've arranged a little DJ gig for X and myself at Restaurant Nada, [åsögatan 140](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=59.3136138%2C18.0792147&hl=en&z=16&ie=UTF8) in Stockholm. Open 19-01, free entrance, a bar, wonderful people and all of the best music, evar.

We'll be playing everything we love that'll fit within that snug time-frame, so if you're keen on hearing stuff old and brand new, turn up. There's a strong possibility that you'll hear artists that are culled from [X's last.fm-page](http://www.last.fm/user/cyndamoore) and [mine](http://www.last.fm/user/pivic) as well, so check those out.

I'll probably be eclectic as usual, so expect indie, electronica, alternative rock, hip-hop, funk, house, pop and funk carioca to be mashed and annexed as far as the I can see. My hands are aching for the wheels of...plastic, and to see people curl into a ball of ecstasy and then explode! If you're feeling social, [here](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=48596499150)'s the Facebook event and [here](http://www.last.fm/event/925849)'s the last.fm event.

Bring a CD, bring yourself, hell, even bring friends and get ready to dance - even if there's [no visible](http://icanhascheezburger.com/category/invisible) dance-floor at the place! Bring it on.

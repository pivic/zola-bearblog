Babyshambles' new single is right here. I got mad with not finding the lyrics, so I transcribed them during a small break at work with help from Mr. Doherty and the army at [the French Dog Blues forum](http://www.frenchdogblues.com/forum).

The lyrics:

> I model lacklustre panicky in vain search for the remedy No words only melody come so I take the day off My love, my love, she sits with me, I love, I love her company Raindrops on roses and dust-filled trinkets
> 
> So, this washes over you my French dog blues Chien bleu chien franzosischer hund And the French dog blues And the French dog blues By the French dog blues
> 
> Never surrender to flattery Frown on, come down on duplicity And above all things my son...take the money and run
> 
> I still model lacklustre panicky in vain search for the remedy No words only melody came ah, take another day off
> 
> Oh, this washes over you French dog blues Chien bleu chien franzosischer hund Yeah, I see you
> 
> I only ever wanted the one with the flag All you ever wanted was a 60 dollar bag And a cheap limousine for your deep pile dreams on the highway on the highway highway, oh
> 
> Chien bleu franzosischer hund
> 
> And the French dog blues And the French dog blues Well, the French dog blues And the French dog

Generally speaking, I think the lyrics on "Shotter's Nation", the new album, are not at all as strong as those found in the band's debut album. Lines like "she's too good-looking/to do the cooking" and "your immense soul/you were dancing to Northern Soul" are more like Tony Hancock than Emily Dickinson, but still, there are gems to be found. Pete! Don't fall asleep at the wheels, now. And bring your band to Stockholm (for real this time).

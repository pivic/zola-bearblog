[![SkypeMe](http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/Front.large.jpg)](http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/Front.large.jpg "Hackerbox.")Yeah, I'm probably getting the [Netgear wi-fi Skype phone](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=niklasblog-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB000F76W78)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1) for home in a while, and it's already available at 250USD for pre-orders, so check it out at Amazon!

The display and the features seem [very easy to use](http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/Skype-phone-screen-shots-1.gif) and best of all, doesn't require a PC for calling. The phone has Skype pre-loaded, which means you only have to access a wireless network, and you're off. I have no idea on how to potentially hook it up with a WEP-protected wi-fi network but I'm hoping Netgear has that covered and will write about it in [the FAQ](http://tools.netgear.com/skype/faqs.html) soon enough, even though the Amazon page states that "hotspots requiring web based authentication are not supported".

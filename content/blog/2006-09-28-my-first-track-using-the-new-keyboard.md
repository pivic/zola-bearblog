I must say I'm rather pleased with myself having produced a track of this collossal magnitude so quick, as I usually spend days and nights with stuff that I never finish. My weakness, of course, lies in not mending the broken bits afterwords, but fuck that - it's really fun to see how quick you can create something when you have a keyboard to fiddle around with rather than having to click your way through hell on a trackboard with an abysmal mouse-pointer.

The result is this, a kind of swing track where you'll hear a my sordid guitar-playing.

P.s. I recorded [this](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-09-27-test.mp3) yesterday, sans any keyboard. It was way less fun than constructing the above.

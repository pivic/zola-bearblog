While in a car, I had the following conversation with X:

Niklas: So, how was your easter weekend? X: Well, I didn't do anything. I never do anything!

\[pause\]

N: Oh. Never? X: Never! Ever. But my brother, he really doesn't do anything. He does _nothing_. I tell him he should do something, but nothing ever happens! N: ... X: Take me, for instance. At least I do _something_. It's not like I lay around.

\[pause\]

N: So, your easter holiday was calm? X: Yeah, I did nothing.

![2007-03-19-madness.jpg](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-03-19-madness.jpg)Yeah, it's _that_ old gem!

I got into [Madness](http://www.madness.co.uk) having discovered tracks such as "Our House", "House of Fun" and "My Girl", but what really tricked me into their nutty world was this track, "One Step Beyond". I caught it off the great collection "[Divine Madness](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Divine-Madness/dp/B00004R63R)" that I borrowed at the local library. When listening to it at home I found myself skipping the weird tracks that I felt were akin to reggae ((Which I at this point in time did not like in the least.)) in some way, going for the more understandable four-to-the-floor-approach; the [back beat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_beat) wasn't all that luring.

After a bit of listening I stopped skipping the tracks. You know what I mean. I just let the record run its full length, repeated it and started feeling the rhythm of the back beat, quickly tapping along with those fast-paced tracks while doing my home-work. I went back to the library in search of more, and found an entire music-genre: [ska](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska), and was fortunate enough to find a CD filled with good ska-tracks, thus discovering [Prince Buster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Buster) and others.

This track is a lovely near-instrumental, displaying the love for music and silly antics these boys had and still have. I strongly recommend the compilation mentioned, even though their big collection of nearly all their albums - titelled "[The Lot](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lot-Madness/dp/B000026MJY)" - and a bunch of videos plus a little booklet. Ah, and a 1-2-3-4..._night boat to Cairooo_!

As usual, the track will be deleted after being available for a week.

Here's the silly video for the track.

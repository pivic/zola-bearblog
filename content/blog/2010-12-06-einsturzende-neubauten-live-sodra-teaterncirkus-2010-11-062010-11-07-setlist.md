![Einstürzende Neubauten](http://seelebrennt.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/10_tourposter.jpg?w=480&h=583)

As I went to see my beloved [Einstürzende Neubauten](http://www.neubauten.org) live @ Södra Teatern/Cirkus celebrating [their 30th anniversary](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5226), I filmed a little which ends up below. It was truly magnificent, way better than the little I heard a couple of years ago at the wrecked quasi-attendance of their concert at Berns.

I really loved hearing songs like "_Seele Brennt_" from the first night. Would have that to show you, if the guard - who was really weird and kept interrupting my friends and myself as we were talking with nonsense like giving us tips about a 3D-movie about piranhas - hadn't told me to shut my camera off.

It was rhythmic and hypnotic to hear [MoserMeyer](http://www.mosermeyer.com), i.e. Christian Meyer & Rudolph Moser (part of EN). They did a good live set consisting of drums, electronics, guitar and a little noise. On the other hand, Alexander Hacke's side-project with his wife, [Hitman's Heel](http://www.hitmansheel.de), was disappointing, churning out ole rockish country-tracks with violin. Too bad.

The day after the second gig X and I left for the USA. As we were sitting at a café waiting for the gate to start boarding, X spotted Hacke sitting a few rows behind me. Oh. Lord.

I went up to him just as his , introduced myself and found him to be charming, attentive and...what can I say? I thanked him for the concerts that X and I had just attended, told him that I'd spent part of the morning listening to both of the concerts as we bought a USB-stick containing them. He asked where X and I were going, smiled and told me he thought Austin was a "lovely city" and it just dawned on me, here's one of the members of possibly the most influential band I've ever come across, and he's a human being. I mean, I _know_ he's a human being and just lovely, but I was quite star-struck. He was really kind, he was. A few curtsies were exchanged, and off I went. And he smiled and waved at X. Off he went. And off we flew.

April 2020, [according to Tom Gray.](https://twitter.com/MrTomGray/status/1249706595573010432)

tl;dr: yes. Read [this article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/spotify-bad-music-musicians-evidence-mounting/), from where the quotes below are taken. Also, read the twitter rollup at the end to understand how dire things are for musicians. I hope sites like [Resonate](https://resonate.is/about/) get going. [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com) are good.

> The debate about whether musicians are treated fairly by [streaming services such as Spotify](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/0/best-music-streaming-services-apple-music-spotify-amazon-music/) took a dark and worrying twist today when the head of an influential House of Commons committee [warned the music industr](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/12/01/music-industry-insiders-fear-reprisals-speaking-against-streaming/)y against interfering with witnesses in an ongoing inquiry.
> 
> Julian Knight, the MP who chairs the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee which is investigating the economics of music streaming, took the rare step of issuing a public statement to warn the industry off. His intervention follows comments at an evidence session last week by singer Nadine Shah that many musicians are “scared to speak out” because they don’t want to “lose favour” with all-powerful streaming services and record labels.

> This is why what happens in the House of Commons matters. Last week Radiohead’s Ed O’Brien, Elbow’s Guy Garvey and Gomez’s Tom Gray gave evidence alongside Shah. Gray’s Broken Record campaign aims to fight for fairer terms for artists. “People don’t seem to realise how high-stakes this is for artists,” someone close to the inquiry tells me. If the committee recommends that changes are needed in the way the industry operates, the Government will be expected to respond and could legislate.

> On the calculation mentioned above, Bad Bunny’s billions of streams would have netted the vocalist the equivalent of £332 million. But not everyone is as lucky. Far from it. Over half of the 50,000 professional musicians in the UK are estimated to earn under £20,000 a year. Across Europe, the average annual amount of money made by an artist from streaming is around £900, the Commons heard last week.

> Elbow’s Garvey gave a typically level-headed assessment of the situation in the Commons last week. Streaming, he said, is a “wonderful thing”. However it hasn’t been properly thought through. There “has been a land grab and it has been clumsy”, Garvey said. He doesn’t want generations to come to lose the ability to make art.

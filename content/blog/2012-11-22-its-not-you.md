[E Talking by Soulwax on Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com/search/song?q=Soulwax%20E%20Talking "E Talking by Soulwax on Grooveshark")

It's strange to know that the decks will soon be mired with holly, not to mention the ceremonial draping of bathrooms, using festively decorated towels that do not absorb any known liquid. I just tried to write "christmas" and ended up with typing "christman" twice in a row.

Yes, I want to see the coming film - "[**Aprà¨s mai**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1846472)" - by one of my newer favourite directors, [Olivier Assayas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Assayas):

Seems a lot like Bertolucci's "[**The Dreamers**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309987)". Fair play! I really liked that film.

It's too early in the morning for reports. Or for anything other than warm air, really; I'm surprised that the computer in front of me isn't heating up the room more than this. And it's cold outside! I wish for snow. But powdery snow, the kind that would bring tears to a nostalgic former child's eyes, what doesn't end up inside your shoes as you're pulsating through it outdoors, through still, stiff air that nearly brings your breathing to a halt.

I loved dinner with X yesterday. [La Neta](http://laneta.se). Kind of a genuine tex mex atmosphere at that place, including the shaved-off decor rather than finding sombreros everywhere. Nice! Really though, with X by my side... _Anywhere, I don't care._

I'll be off now. Into the breech. I'll listen to [some remastered Joy Division live](http://thepowerofindependenttrucking.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/joy-division-8-feb-1980-univ-of-london.html) and read more of David Foster Wallace's "**The Pale King**". You'd better download that music.

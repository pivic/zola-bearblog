Yesterday X and I cleaned out my wardrobe and during that I found some old stuff of mine from the 1980s. Enjoy!

Even though the cat looks like it has a penis, I didn't mean it to; I remember working really hard at that "3d effect" with the tail.

A couple of evil peers in my class told me the cat's front paws looked like penises. It made me cry.

Self-portrait. I worked really hard with it, but I've no idea what happened when I drew the nose. Or the eye-brows. Maybe it's because the sun was so close to my face.

A diploma from 1987, cheering my skiing capabilities on. As everybody I know knows, I'm absolutely crap at skiing. I skiied **into a concrete wall** once, which ended everything that had to do with skiing.

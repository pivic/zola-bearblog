It's tech support time!

**User**: Hello! I'm Lisa, Calling from PlaceX. **Me**: Hello Lisa, what can I help you with? **U**: Well, there's a thing-a-ma-jig loose in my computer, hee! **M**: Ah, is there something physically loose, perhaps something that's broken down, or do you mean something else? **U**: _Something else_. Something else! Of course, there's always _something else_!

This is where you can tell that the conversation is not going to be easy. Mostly, people who behave like this are either jokers or lonely persons. Or both. At this time, I swear it, I started hearing the opening riff for The Doors' "_The End_". Just play the track throughout.

**M**: What seems to be the matter? **U**: Oh yes.

Where to begin?

**M**: Lisa, I see that there are three persons named Lisa at PlaceX, what is your surname? **U**: Surname. My _sur_name? **M**: Yes, I'd like to have your surname in order to register your case, please. **U**: Oh well, I changed my surname a few years ago!

An awkward moment of silence swooped down.

**M**: Well, so what is your current name? **U**: Lisa. **M**: ... **U**: Alright, Lisa X. **M**: Thank you. So, what seems to be the matter with your computer? **U**: I'm just wondering when I can get a new one, this one sucks _ass_. **M**: ...oh, that's for your manager to decide. She/He has to order a new one. **U**: Oh, thanks. **M**: Is there anything else I can help you with? **U**: Nah, we've sorted out my name issue, too. **M**: Great. Thanks for calling! **U**: Bye!

...and I'm really looking forward to meeting friends outdoors, hanging out, living the life with my X and experiencing all that life has to offer.

A couple of days ago I submitted a letter of resignation to my old work-place. That felt good. I've been with my new employer for three months now.

I'm looking forward to so many things, e.g. meeting friends, wallowing in the sun, maybe going abroad with X. In a couple of weeks a Texan friend will be staying with us for a few days. I'm really looking forward to that.

Speaking of which, Maylinn's back in town! Seems like just a few weeks since X and I left Oklahoma and now she's back and we've met a few times already. As though "_Kids_" never left the audio-player...

Yesterday, upon returning home from work, I discovered that X had refurbished the kitchen. So lovely, it truly was. I love her sense of style; luckily we both kind-of share the same sense of style, so here's to my patting myself on the back. And the kitchen's much roomier now.

More later, diary.

Not very new news, I'm afraid. No, I'm not dead! Yes, I am preparing a blog post that describes what's been happening in the past week or so; well, I'm alive, so there!

I just listened to The Cookies' old song called "Only To Other People". If you've ever heard a b-side Morrissey has recorded, titelled "Girl Least Likely To", you'd find he's ripped ye olde track off. Straight off! The melody from the verse and the chorus, even the bridge, is snatched! Moahaha.

I know The Smiths covered The Cookies' "I Want A Boy For My Birthday", but this is a tad different.

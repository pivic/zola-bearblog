The second day at Popaganda actually started with a trip to [Trädgården](http://www.tradgarden.com), where X and I shopped with D&T and Ida! It's a weird, lovely little place.

I love places that combine the industrial with trees, grass and other living organisms. On the other hand, the weather didn't seem to comply; while on the subway en route to Trädgården, the rain started pouring down.

I really didn't want to dress in a plastic raincoat but was prepared to. But as we hit our destination subway station, the downpour became a drizzle and gradually subsided; it poured down a little later, but there was very little rain during the festival. Yipee!

We had some trouble deciphering this sign; no, wheelchairs weren't forcibly tied to the tree.

Hot Chip. They lack allure to me. No real spunk, I'm afraid. Not my cup of tea.

This picture looked really scary on my mobile phone - the drinker in the bottom-right corner of the picture looks as though she's a ghost.

[**Makthaverskan**](http://makthaverskan.bandcamp.com) was really good! I mean, I really enjoy their two albums, and they were near-painfully scared/nervous on-stage. They admitted to this. They were quite stand-still on stage, but still alive; perhaps this is due to their jangly music, which is kind of a cross between Those Dancing Days and some guitar-driven jangle band. My description doesn't do this lot justice. Still, the male guitarist kissed the male drummer in a remarkably all-as-usual fashion which is the most punk thing I saw during the entire festival, the possible exception being the bassist from Makthaverskan, who after the show told the audience that she hadn't expected so many people to turn up, and hence had looked down at her bass during the entire gig. Sweet! The singer has an awesome voice. And by no way, the kissing guitarist was later spotted kissing a girl, slipping and kicking me during his fall. What celeb stories I push out through this blog, let me tell ya.

The guy is actually a fan. The song _demanded_ a fuck you. He danced like hell and deserves kudos!

The best seat in the house.

Ah yes, **[Håkan Hellström](http://www.hakanhellstrom.se)**. He was due for a two-hour set and didn't disappoint. I saw people crying during his gig. I cried, myself; X and I swooned in (and out of) tact and the whole gig was lovely. We danced, screamed lyrics ((As always, I'm prone to sing along with songs even though I don't know the lyrics one itty bit.)), saw others who danced and sang. Watching what Makthaverskan called "youngsters" standing in the front rows of this gig being displayed on the big projection screens was just a very loving, deeply passionate and seemingly ephemeral moment that will most likely last those peeps a lifetime.

And so came [the confetti](http://www.popaganda.se/nyheter/tack-alla-for-i-ar).

The best about Popaganda to me is going there with people I love, meeting people who are nice, seeing artists that I love and finding new artists. The bad bit about Popaganda, I feel, is that more and more people are allowed in; this year, I think there were just too many in such a small space. There were super-long queues to get food, drink and bathroom privacy, so I hope that really gets sorted until next year. The food was varied, which was nice. Oh yeah, and the sound was quite bad on the little stage most of the time, especially when Kate Nash played on Day 1. Other than that - good one!

To finish off, I'll leave you with a quick vid from Håkan's gig. Aaaw. It's an emotional experience.

P.s. There's a near-three-hour-long Swedish Radio stream (in Swedish) from the festival available [here](http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=4067&artikel=5631828), including some words from The xx, audio from Jessie Ware and Hot Chip's gigs.

![Thomas J. Watson and Adolf Hitler](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2009-07-02-hitlerwatson.jpg)By watching [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkoM8RB-kJ0#t=105), you'll see a little on how IBM helped the nazis by leasing them punch-card systems, in order to count the number of jews that were lodged at the concentration camps. From the great documentary titelled "[The Corporation](http://www.thecorporation.com)", here's word from Edwin Black, the author of "[IBM and the Holocaust](http://www.ibmandtheholocaust.com)".

Each application had to be custom-designed for the nazis, by IBM technicians. Do note that I wrote that IBM leased the computers to the nazis, i.e. IBM made more money that way, than they had by just selling the systems to the nazis. The punch-cards were made by the millions, exclusively by IBM, who collected the money from this operation just after the war.

It's discerning to see the VP of IBM say that IBM only sold the machines and couldn't know how they were being used. [This bit from the above video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkoM8RB-kJ0#t=285) shows how IBM in fact serviced said systems on-site once per month, since 1941; this is _before_ the nazis started using mass-extermination techniques, i.e. gassing in concentration camps.

The picture of [Thomas J. Watson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas%20J.%20Watson) (founding CEO, IBM) sitting at a table with Adolf Hitler reminds me a lot of [the classic picture of Donald Rumsfeld shaking hands with Saddam Hussein](http://www.flickr.com/photos/clintjcl/189525347/); ah, sweet friends - until too many people got to know the truth.

OK, so this picture doesn't show Lotta at her most lovin', or even being in her normal mood, but it goes to show what I love: X and our borrowed cat, Lotta.

She's two years old, her breed name is S\*Skindividual Whole Lotta Love, but we're calling her Lotta. This past Tuesday we went to Lotta's owner who's apparently an excellent breeder; I've spoken with her on the phone from time to time to see whether or not she'll have any kittens in the near future and until her breeding queen Kismet spawns little ones, we're borrowing Lotta for a while.

She's a [Sphynx cat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphynx_(cat)). A lot of allergics can stand sphynxes, and as I'm allergic to all animals furry, we're trying her out. She's pure joy and is very cuddly. X and I've grown to love her intensely over the past...day that we've come to know her. Here's a tiny video-snippet from yesterday, showing how cuddly she is.

    

She's very prone to jumping on top of our backs just as we're expecting it the least. When deciding to jump me, she's not thinking about impossibilities, like "will I be physically able to scale Niklas' back when he's standing up?" because _she's got claws_. Yes, she's got claws/and don't I know it! My neck and throat looks as though I've tried to commit suicide using a fingernail.

We love Lotta, we do.

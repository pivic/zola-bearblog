Do you remember [this old post of mine](https://niklasblog.com/?p=769), where I asked [DN](http://dn.se) (or rather, Anders Hellberg, the journalist who wrote the piece) what the hell was going on? I've received a reply, more than five (5) months on!

On the 27th of March, I was e-mailed by Lilian à–hrström, the ombudsman at DN, who wrote that technical difficulties and response in the paper had hindered me in receiving a response. So, what happened? Well, she writes that the term "immigrant youths" shouldn't have been used by Anders Hellberg. She also writes she is sorry for the second reply I received from the journalist; I don't know whether she means she was sorry for me actually receiving it, or the contents and madness of his reply, but my strong guess says the latter option. Thank you, Lilian. I just hope DN will flog some reporters into actually 1) keeping to the subject and not be prejudiced plus 2) answering with valid replies.

One always has to [mind the bollocks](http://www.agi.it/english/news.pl?doc=200604051712-1175-RT1-CRO-0-NF11&page=0&id=agionline-eng.oggitalia). More on that, [here](http://smh.com.au/news/world/pig-latin-berlusconi-vents-the-vernacular-on-opponents/2006/04/05/1143916594760.html). Berlusconi _must_ lose; of course, that's what one said about Dubya last time around.

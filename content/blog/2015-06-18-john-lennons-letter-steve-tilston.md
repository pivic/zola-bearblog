So, what's the above? From [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/21/letter-john-lennon-singer-steve-tilston-al-pacino-film-danny-collins) in The Guardian:

> In 2010, an interviewer had begged Tilston him to tell him something he didn’t know about his life. “So I said, ‘Oh, there was this letter John Lennon sent me with his phone number on it.’”

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Tilston#Personal_life):

> In August 2010, it was reported that John Lennon had penned a letter of support to Tilston in 1971, though it was never delivered. Lennon had been inspired to write to the then 21 year-old folk singer after having read an interview in ZigZag magazine in which Tilston admitted he feared wealth and fame might negatively affect his songwriting. Tilston did not become aware of the letter’s existence until a collector contacted him in 2005 to verify its authenticity.

This is what the letter says:

> Being rich doesn't change your experiences in the way you think.
> 
> The only difference, basically, is that you don't have you worry about money - food - roof etc. but all other experiences - emotions - relationships - are the same as anybodies.
> 
> I know, I have been rich and poor and so has Yoko (rich - poor - rich). So whadya think of that. Love John and Yoko.

In [this article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/7946804/John-Lennon-letter-to-aspiring-folk-singer-received-nearly-four-decades-later.html) in The Telegraph, Yoko Ono remembers:

> Yoko Ono, 77, confirmed that she remembered Lennon, who was assassinated aged 40 in 1980, writing the letter.
> 
> She said: "'John reflected his moods of that moment in his writing.
> 
> "This one is very special because he was writing to another musician, didn't want to sound preachy, so made his handwriting oddly rough and artistic, calligraphically. It's nice to see this one after all these years. I love it."

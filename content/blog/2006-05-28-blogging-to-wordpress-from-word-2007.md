First: I tried to post this using a WordPress.com-account but no matter what I did, the post would not show, so hence here it is, the HTML copied straight from the WordPress.com-editor:

Having followed [this guide](http://blogs.msdn.com/joe_friend/archive/2006/05/12/595963.aspx) from a Microsoft blog, plus [this one](http://kristab.officeisp.net/picture%20library/blog%20help.mht), I managed to post this using nothing but MS Word 2007. It’s pretty straight-forward, but it seems to require your running a WordPress.com-account so far. As you may or may not know, everybody's welcome to [download MS Office 2007 beta 2 for free](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/beta/getthebeta.mspx) use until 2007-02-01, when it'll start working in "limited mode." Offline blogging is nice, right? Here’s how to do it:

First, click through \[Office symbol, top left corner\]: Publish: Blog:

After you pick **Blog**, you’ll see the following window:

Here, you pick **Other** and click Next, which shows you the following:

Of course, your username and password are known to you only. The API must be **MetaWebLog** and Blog Post URL must be formatted as in the picture (but you must swap "name" for the prefix for your WordPress-blog).

Two things:

1. If you want to post to a blog that's not at wordpress.com, it won't work at the moment. Why? I quote Steven Patrick Morrissey: "I dunno." It must (and probably will) work in future versions, if this will remain a hit.
2. Picture uploading does currently not work. This will be worked out in future versions of Word 2007. If you, however, remain brave and do try to use this, you will see the following window...

...for a while, followed by an error message. Little wonder.

So far, I'm happy with rolling with the built-in editor that WordPress provides, but am very much looking forward to blogging using Word 2007 whenever possible. If image-handling gets working and as easy-going as Office 2007 lets it be, I'll be an avid follower.

P.s. Bonus round. If you wanna see how OneNote integrates with Pocket PC, check [this](http://www.pocketpcthoughts.com/articles.php?action=expand,48979) nice guide. It wouldn't install on my Pocket PC running Windows Mobile 2003 though, maybe you have to run v2005 to get it working?

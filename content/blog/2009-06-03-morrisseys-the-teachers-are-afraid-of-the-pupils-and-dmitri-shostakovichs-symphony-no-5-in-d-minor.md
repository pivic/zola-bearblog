![Dmitri Shostakovich](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3374/3262261863_8323240f06_m.jpg)Many people do not know it, but [Morrissey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey)'s song named "_The Teachers Are Afraid Of The Pupils_" contains a string-section from [Dmitri Shostakovich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri%20Shostakovich)'s "_Symphony No. 5 in D minor_". If you wish to compare them, a Spotify playlist of the two is found [here](http://open.spotify.com/user/pivic/playlist/79c8Qg3U68ZWi5cAU62pIK).

From David Bret's "_[Morrissey](http://books.google.se/books?id=hK6lUbtUxmAC&hl=en)_" on the matter:

> 'Southpaw Grammar is the school of hard knocks,' Morrissey had told Stuart Maconie, 'it's coming up the hard way and taking your bruises with you.' The cynics, of course, were quick in pointing out that 'southpaw' meant fighting with the left hand - and in gay parlance, 'batting for the other side'. The opening track, 'The Teachers Are Afraid Of The Pupils', has as its central theme Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, therefore brevity would be deemed inappropriate. Morrissey had certainly done his homework. The great Russian composer, himself castigated for his views (accused by the Communist Party of having antidemocratic tendencies) and a chronic depressive on account of this, had composed the piece in 1937, giving it the subtitle, 'In Answer To Just Criticism'. It had re-established his reputation in the Soviet Union, and like the later Gorecki piece was a firm favourite amongst pacifists.

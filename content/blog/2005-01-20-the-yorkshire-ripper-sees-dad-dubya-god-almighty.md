It seems half of [England is enflamed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4190525.stm) over Peter Sutcliffe getting a chance to see his father's grave. It's a year since he died, so Pete wants to go, and as he's jailed for God telling him to kill 13 people (an advice he followed), that poses a problem.

Who the hell cares? The man probably still mentally insane. If he says God told him to kill, you'd better believe it! I just saw "The Jesus Factor", a very good show where George Bush II was the centerpiece, and his belief in Gawd was the center of that. It showed that before the 2001-09-11-episode, he was enthralled by the evangelical christians of the USA partly as he was a raging alcoholic and drug-addict, partly as he had "been born again". Anyway, being born again must have affected his every sense, as he went berzerk, just like kids on tantrums. After 2001-09-11 he again used his christian pals to rule the USA, as the evangelical christians = a lot of votes. He also said he'd become a "compassionate conservative", which is brilliant: the compassionate christians embraced that as it meant he wasn't all that conservative so they'd vote for him, then, and the conservatives heard their little catch-phrase to wheel them to the voting-booths. After that, he used biblical rhetorics and lies to show the world how he intended to rule it. For instance, he used a phrase by biblical Paul (not McCartney) in a speech, where suddenly, USA was the "beacon of light" upon the world; not in the least what is in the bible. Unless Dubya's people have changed it. As Bill Hicks says: "Who are the fucking Gideons? They sneak up from nowhere, and place bibles in your hotel-room. But no-body's even _seen_ a Gideon! No, no! You know what? I'm gonna catch me a Gideon." Anyway, [the synopsis is available here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jesus/etc/synopsis.html), and - lo and behold - [the entire video is available for free viewing right here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jesus/view).

The thing that struck me the hardest, was (and is) the way Bush II tries to intertwine state and religion, which the Americans' first amendment goes against. It's interesting to see how he tries, the fucking beast of Satan, to use his own way of wording. Oh I'd like to stick his head into the mental vacuum he has created. Isn't it strange, how hate, fear and nationalism makes people stop thinking? [It's good we're on the web, blogging about this](http://www.workingforchange.com/comic.cfm?itemid=15964). I don't believe in any religion, but I'm pretty sure everyone who voted for Dubya will go to Hell. The Biblical One.

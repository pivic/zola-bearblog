I've had the following two songs rolling in my head for weeks, and by doing this, I hope to get them out from my system (in a good way; I still want them in).

First, Josh played two lovely concerts in London in December, which were things I'll always cherish. What a guy. I want "_Countryversy_" to be out.

Anyway, Lift To Experience plugged into me. Their "_Falling From Cloud 9_" is wondrous:

Josh T. Pearson is probably the most underrated musician of our time. At least in the year 2018. His gig in Stockholm, Sweden, was something of the most blissful I've seen in a long time. Plus, he's a Texan gentleman.

God, it makes me miss Texas.

The other song I can't seem to knock, by elusive "**[Radio Tehran](https://www.discogs.com/artist/4339259-Radio-Tehran)**", I've had in my head since I heard the soundtrack for "_A Girl Walks Home Alone_", which I saw thanks to [Neko Case in The Quietus](http://thequietus.com/articles/24584-neko-case-interview-favourite-albums?page=10).

What a track. Apart from successfully dragging itself from being a slow Persian near-psych-using-school-rock-instruments kind of track, then going bouncy, and in the end...it's just a well-written and lovely song.

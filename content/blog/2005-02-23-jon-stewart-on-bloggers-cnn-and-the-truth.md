I can't help myself from shrieking with laughter when finding out through [this page](http://news.com.com/Jon+Stewart+on+bloggers/2061-12_3-5586033.html?part=rss&tag=5575731), that a blogger was responsible for getting the "news director" at CNN sacked recently. Check that page out! It's a link to a QuickTime film showing a snippet from Stewart's "The Daily Show" where he also "uncovers" the true identity of a Dubya-ass-rimmer who appeared at the press conference of 2005-01-27. You have to check that video out.

Here's info on the story that Stewart reports on \[pardon me for posting screwy on this ordeal, but I'm just too happy about the morons getting exposed\], from Media Matters:

> \[...\] former Talon News Washington bureau chief and White House correspondent Jeff Gannon (aka James D. Guckert) was permitted to attend White House press briefings under an alias and despite having no credentials as a journalist.

Apart from that, the ass-rimming-part is that Guckert (saying he's "Jeff Gannon") asked Dubya how he's going to deal with "some democratic leaders" as "they seem to have divorced themselves from reality". This is fully available in the above video clip. Guckert is a reporter from Talon News, a "news site", that mainly re-prints White House press statements.

That video clip shows why I love "The Daily Show" at times, which isn't to say it's flawless.

> Before the bloggers out me, I'd just like to say, my real name isn't Steven Colbert, it's Ted Hitler. \[...\] These bloggers, OK, they don't have credentials. They just have facts, OK?

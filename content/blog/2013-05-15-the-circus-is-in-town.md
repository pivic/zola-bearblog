Yes, the circus actually is in town. I love being surrounded by grazing, lazy animals. It may be a reason for why I love Blixa, but right now I'd love to see X beside me on a beach, sun shining, high temperature...

I can't wait until Primavera Sound. No beach, but just about everything else that's good. I pray for good weather!

**Bonus**: the below apartment high-rise is currently being near my workplace. Why the 1970s aesthetic? Why do those balconies look like that? Waah.

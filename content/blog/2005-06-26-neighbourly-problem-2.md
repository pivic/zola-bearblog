Today, the brother of our upstairs neighbour knocked on our door. He was nice, and told us that he didn't think his brother had caused [the ruckus the other day](https://niklasblog.com/?p=672), as he's now in intensive care due to an aneurysm. The man added he thought his brother isn't likely to ever leave the current care he's in, alive. How sad. I'm actually sad for him, even though he was nationalistic and semi-deaf (letting his deafness affect others in a bad way).

If I can make one wish: don't let 1) a family with noisy kids, 2) alcoholics or 3) somebody with a mental disorder take his place. Please, Bog.

OK. I forgot. _The shame!_ I forgot one album in [my best-of-2009-list](https://niklasblog.com/?p=3998), and that album is Franz Ferdinand's "[**Tonight: Franz Ferdinand**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonight%3A%20Franz%20Ferdinand)". I have no idea why it got lost in the fray, but with a song like "_[Lucid Dreams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreams "Lucid Dreams")_" it should be remembered.

That song makes this album deserve a spot on my list altogether.

While not as immediately poppy or even [Xenomania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenomania "Xenomania")\-produced as it was first to be, it's more electronics than usually, but lovely. The lyrics have lost a bit of bite methinks, even though they still shine; e.g. from "_Twilight Omens_":

> I typed your number into my calculator Where it spelled a dirty world When I turned it upside down You can turn my dirty world The right way 'round

...they win. And with using a human skeleton as percussion (as heard in "_[No You Girls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_You_Girls "No You Girls")_") they win again.

Also of interest, the band has released "**[Blood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonight:_Franz_Ferdinand#Blood_bonus_disc)**", a bonus CD containing dub-mixes of all of the tracks from the album.

Don't forget to check out the songs, most notably the singular, druggy partier's paradise that is "_Lucid Dreams_". Set to headphones, thick bass at the end, good mid-range. Sizzle with the sine-waves. Enjoy.

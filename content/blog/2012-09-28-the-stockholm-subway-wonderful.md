Two boys enter the same subway cart that I'm in and see a poster for the action film "Looper".

"Oh wow! It looks so cool!"etc. Etc.

They exit.

Two teenage girls, who throughout the boys' conversation looked at each other as though they were about to vomit:

"What fucking pussies. I bet they were on their way home to beg their mommies for new iphones."

I wanted to shout hooray but instead laughed and couldn't stop myself.

Has anything happened since [Spotify started supporting transphobia, hypocrisy, and a culture of silence](https://niklasblog.com/?p=25336)?

From The Fader:

> Spotify has [announced a new feature](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-11-02/amplifying-artist-input-in-your-personalized-recommendations/) for artists and labels seeking to increase exposure. In a press release issued November 2, the digital streaming platform unveiled a new function that will allow creators at all levels to boost their visibility through Spotify's algorithmic music selector that the app defaults to on the radio and autoplay functions.

Will artists have to pay to get their music to the 'top'? You bet:

> While Spotify notes that the feature won't require any immediate upfront costs, it will only be available in exchange for lowered royalty payments: "Labels or rights holders agree to be paid a promotional recording royalty rate for streams in personalized listening sessions where we provided this service." Furthermore, the press release adds that accepting these new terms "won’t guarantee placement to labels or artists."

So, while [Spotify lobby to reduce songwriter royalties by a third](https://niklasblog.com/?p=22906), they want musicians to pay to play. [Payola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola), in other words, is what it boils down to. All of this while tracking user interactions and experiences via their apps, and using that data to predict how to best manipulate and sell user behaviour.

This is disgusting surveillance capitalism.

Also:

> Just last week, [over 4,000 independent artists in the Union of Musicians and Allied Workers](https://www.thefader.com/2020/10/27/union-musicians-allied-workers-justice-at-spotify-campaign) presented a new campaign demanding that Spotify pay at least one cent per stream, among other requests for a more equitable streaming environment. "Music workers create all of the enormous wealth Spotify accumulates for its CEO, its investors, and the major labels," [the Union wrote in an open letter](https://www.unionofmusicians.org/justice-at-spotify-demands). "But we artists continue to be underpaid, misled, and otherwise exploited by the company."

One day, the truth about Daniel Ek will out.

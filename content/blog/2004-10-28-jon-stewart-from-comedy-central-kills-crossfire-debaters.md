How about that. Jon Steward walks on CNN's "Crossfire", a debate show which isn't really about debating as it's foremost a spectacle, and yikes - he kills the show hosts verbally. Check it out [here,](http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2652831?showw=no&refsite=6761) available in three video formats.

On a more serious note, [Triumph The Insult Comic Dog does it good as well](http://www.ifilm.com/viralvideo?ifilmid=2653646). "So tell me, did it hurt when the doctors removed your sense of shame?"

Anders, a very good friend of Sebastian, one of Mikaela's brothers, came by today, removed the old tiles and plastered the surface. It will dry until Thursday, when Anders will return to start tiling. [Here are three pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-07-20) from what it looks like today.

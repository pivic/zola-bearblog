![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-05-10-dangelo.jpg)I've just started to watch [The Wire](http://www.hbo.com/thewire), an American TV series about cops, the FBI and crooks. Corruption, drugs, trafficking and deaths are one thing, but this series has a great story and the writers a really good way with words. I recently read an interview with [David Simon](http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/crew/david_simon.shtml), the creator and producer of the show, which made the show look very interesting, so I had to check it out.

It's about a bunch of Baltimore cops, who are trying to catch drug-pushers and the people controlling their chain-of-comand; it's an operation, not cops just content with catching the off-hand criminal. The series portrays cops _and_ criminals as human beings, some sensitive, some utterly psychopathic, trying to help or/and frame each-other.

There's racism and segregation in Baltimore, which the series push to the surface; most of the pushers are black, and hey - a lot of the cops are, too - 2/3 of the population in Baltimore is black, which Simon and his cohorts have tried to portray justly.

Catch it. The two first seasons are available on DVD now.

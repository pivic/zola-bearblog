It's always a bit sad to see kitty posters announcing that somebody misses them, especially when you see a bit of the love in the actual poster, like this one.

Friday at Systembolaget, which is the only government-funded franchise in Sweden that's legally allowed to sell alcoholic beverages with a percentage of alcohol stretching above the 5-limit or so. Yes, we live in the dark ages. No, I don't know if that's a good thing or not in this instance.

We saw "**[House](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076162/)**" in the past week with Björn. Marvellous film. I've reviewed it [here](http://www.allconsuming.net/person/pivic/progress/7437895).

Well, time to write something personal and try and swing this around from being a menial, impersonal blog to what it was once written for - exceptional myself.

First, I've been busy at work, trying to better my skills in an environment which I haven't touched in several years, really. Those who think IT is all one single biz had better look out the window and try to catch a simile of a clue. It's swings and roundabouts and a big fat furry cat; if you think that sentence is a load of bollocks, you'd just love working with what I do for a living.

Apart from that, the new Minister of Culture in Sweden, Cecilia Stegö Chilà² - actually part of nutsquad Timbro tankesmedja ([who I wrote about almost a year ago to this very day](https://niklasblog.com/?p=798)) - hasn't paid her telly license for 10 whole years. I wouldn't care a bit about it if it weren't for Timbro tankesmedja's intellectual stance, which doesn't really exist. Good times, good times.

Speaking of which, I enjoy to read the online thoughts of Pete Doherty. [Here](http://tinyurl.com/p3duo)'s a good, lengthy example - where he actually thanks somebody for introducing him to [Immortal Technique](http://www.immortal-technique.com) - and [here](http://frenchdogblues.com/forum/search.php?search_author=heavyhorse) you'll find all he's written at that site so far.

It's great to see his words, even the ramblings. As I always carry a notebook with me I find myself scribbling in it, churning out words, bits and pieces I come up with. Actual sentences, sometimes. I'm writing for myself, and it feels...like it did when I last wrote for myself, which is about ten years ago. It's slow, it's nice and I like it. Now time to eat the hummus I just made; it's all about fattening for winter, and the TV says a plane has crashed into a building in the USA. _Oh, mother._

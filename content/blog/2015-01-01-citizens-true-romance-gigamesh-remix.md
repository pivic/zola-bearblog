I think François Ozon makes some really good films. When I saw "_[Young & Beautiful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_%26_Beautiful)_" I loved hearing a track by Vitalic in it (([This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2dfGC1oziE).)) but the real catch turned out to be by Citizens, a band I hadn't heard about before. Or, to be fair, the best thing about the track is the remix by Gigamesh, which is the version that's on the soundtrack:

It made my mind and ass move, as it took hold of me and wouldn't let go. I don't know how many times I've heard this track since then, but whenever people hear it play they want to know which artist and track it is. I love a track that puts fun back in music, and when a remix makes a track different and (at times) makes it even better, that's where I want to be.

This is the new year's post you wish you'd have seen yesterday? No! Dance in the new year today, I say. _Live and love!_

P.s. [Here](http://vimeo.com/50700292)'s the original version of the song.

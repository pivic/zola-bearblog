Brilliant! Also, "Southpaw Grammar" is remastered and set to drop in July with three extra tracks and new artwork; does this entail a new cover?

I'm being blasphemous, but I don't like the quality of the old cover shot for "Southpaw", I do not; it is of course on the left-hand side of this post, even though [the cover for "Maladjusted"](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1059/1116791689_816bfb9907.jpg) is only a tad better. Thankfully, the man has gotten better at it through the ages, and I think [the cover for "Ringleader of The Tormentors"](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2307/2484865073_8a526cfdd5_m.jpg) is the best in many a year, even though I cannot say I approve of [what's on "_That's How People Grow Up_"](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2416/2278805068_b97da54ddd.jpg).

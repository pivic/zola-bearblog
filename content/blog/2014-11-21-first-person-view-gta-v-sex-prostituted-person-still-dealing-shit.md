Before GTA V, [**the GTA video-game franchise**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29) has been a third-person perspective thing. Starting with GTA V, you can see everything from a first-person perspective.

That should be awesome, but seeing the above video is one of the more distressing things I've seen in a long time; I had to skip a lot of it, but I saw more than enough to distil it. And no, telling me that "you can do whatever in the game, so you don't HAVE to do that" is not worth anything; you kill, con, destroy and do all kinds of shit throughout the game, and I've loved doing that, but that video ((As sexism is, always.)) is just as appealing and as OK as being the perpetrator of pedophilia, slavery and waterboarding, the last of which actually _is_ included in GTA V; I don't know about the rest of the offences.

So, another version of GTA where women are subjects, men all commit violent crimes constantly throughout the games? From [this piece on GTA V from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29#Grand_Theft_Auto_V:_witness_torture_and_sexism):

> Sam Houser, Rockstar Games co-founder, felt that the development team sometimes overlooked their portrayal of women in Grand Theft Auto games, but that the weight towards male characters "fit with the story we wanted to tell."

I'll tell you a story: I won't be buying your sexist game.

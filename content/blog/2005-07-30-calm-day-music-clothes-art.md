I've finally found myself a music mag that I like a lot, at least the summer issue: [Fader](http://www.thefader.com) magazine is good, writes mostly about quite unknown artists, provides excellent photography and very interesting links to great sites where you can pick up music, art, news, et.c. The only problem is that the subscription cost is currently 75USD/8 issues, but if you live in the USA, go get it if you're into music, as it's only 20USD/8 issues and you get a DVD of choice (plus you're up for a CD). I would probably not have bought my issue for 99SKR (~12USD) if the price wasn't cut in half. But do check out their site. Right now they've got audio clips from their White Stripes-interview up, downloadble for free. That's nice.

I went around taking pictures using my new lens today. I walked around [Fru√§ngen](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/sets/628388), and even though I love my new lens it's no telephoto lens, so I've got to get myself a camera case with room for a couple of lenses as I couldn't carry the other one with me due to its size. I did, however, manage to take a few shots resulting in [this panoramic image](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/29683085), which I stitched together using a simple program.

[I've mentioned](https://niklasblog.com/?p=317) [Thorsten van Elten](http://www.thorstenvanelten.com)'s now-famous collection, especially the piece "[Pigeon Light](http://www.thorstenvanelten.com/lighting/product/?ID=3)", before, and now I've found [plusminuszero](http://www.plusminuszero.jp/collection/index.html), the site where [Naoto Fukasawa](http://www.naotofukasawa.com), creator of [the wall-mounted CD-player](http://www.muji.net/faq/electric/cdplayer01.html) that was manufactured by [Muji](http://www.muji.com), doshes out a variety of nice products. Check out their collections [here](http://www.plusminuszero.jp/collection/index.html). I'm more for the second collection, which, incidentally, is the one currently unavailable for purchase online. I mean, I like [this trash-can](http://www.plusminuszero.jp/collection/2nd06_trashcan.html) and [this CD-player](http://www.plusminuszero.jp/collection/2nd01_cdradio.html) (almost completely relieved from buttons), but my favourite is [this hot water-dispenser](http://www.plusminuszero.jp/collection/2nd02_hotwater.html) which I'd very much like to have in my office-room. Mmm.

I'm also thinking about buying a new jacket. I'm tired of my old denim jacket, as it's much too large for me and it's very worn-down. I just don't know what to get, but [this Fred Perry-jacket](http://se.zoovillage.com/store/productdetail.asp?CategoryID=3&BrandID=0&DisplayItemID=13722&Position=16&ListType=0) could be it.

I've also been scouring [The D.A.P. Catalog](http://www.artbook.com), which is filled with art. I'd very much like "Catholic". You'll see why [when you find out more about it](http://store.yahoo.com/artbook/1933045159.html).

I've been doing yoga-exercises more, and my back, shoulders and neck feel better than ever. I haven't used my asthma machine once, since I started to do yoga, two weeks ago. It may be the placebo-effect, but I don't care: my body loves me, and I feel more at rest when doing yoga.

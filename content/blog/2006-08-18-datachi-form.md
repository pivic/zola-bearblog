![Joseph Fraioli](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-08-18-datach'i.jpg)Joseph Fraioli is [Datach'i](http://www.myspace.com/datachi), somebody who obviously loves WARP, and probably mostly Squarepusher and Aphex Twin. I've just discovered the excellence of his "[Black Trees](http://tinyurl.com/zse6h)", from which this track is pinched.

This is intense, dark stuff that I'd love to correlate with what Fraioli says his music sounds like: "dead people falling off heavy machinery while having sex". It's high-speed drum 'n' bass, influenced by [Dario Argento](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000783) and [John Carpenter](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118) (according to the artist) and is very reminiscent of Squarepusher's stuff, mainly "[Ultravisitor](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=niklasblog-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B0001E70BM%2526tag=niklasblog-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B0001E70BM%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")", although I also come to think of LFO's "[Sheath](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=niklasblog-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B0000C668I%2526tag=niklasblog-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B0000C668I%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")" and of the old band [Oval](http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct02/articles/oval.asp), formerly on the label [Mille Plateaux](http://www.mille-plateaux.net).

Observe the track will be available for a week only. Get the EP from which this track hails, in much better quality, right [here](http://www.bleep.com/?bleep=SLR704).

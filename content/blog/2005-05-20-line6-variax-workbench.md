If you love guitars, you've probably come across the company Line6. People calling themselves "purists" think they're a bunch of valley lords injecting synthesizers into electric guitars, but on the other side of the line drawn in sand, there are a lot of hungry people like Jeff Beck, who've been around forever, who support what Line6 are doing. Me? I don't give a fob about how people make music as long as it's good.

A while back I wrote about the [Variax 300](https://niklasblog.com/?p=515) from Line6, and now they've released Variax Workbench, a piece of software to make the Variax 300 sound like hellfire. Check [this screen-shot](http://www.line6.com/media/email/variaxworkbench/image.jpg) out. It's a lot like their software for the Pod_xt_ that I've got, except it seems you can do more with this software, e.g. create your own tunings and move, rotate or stack pickups.

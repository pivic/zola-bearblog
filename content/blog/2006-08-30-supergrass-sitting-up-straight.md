I shan't lie. I haven't always liked Supergrass. When their first album, "[I Should Coco](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=niklasblog-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B000002TXE%2526tag=niklasblog-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B000002TXE%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")" turned up, I was appalled by the Monkees-ishness of the video for "Mansize Rooster", but caught on (as did everybody else, I suppose) when "[Alright](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_e4PxtQ-Fw)" turned up on everybody's MTV; that link's to the video.

Their aftermath, i.e. albums like "[In It for the Money](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=niklasblog-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B000002UJO%2526tag=niklasblog-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B000002UJO%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")" and "[Supergrass](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=niklasblog-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00004S95F%2526tag=niklasblog-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00004S95F%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")", was great (until their latest album, which is bore galore). Check it out.

Anyway, this track is off the very first album and knocked the living bejesus out of me when I heard it the first hundred times. I still love it, and it's sort of a brilliant bagatelle, a reminder of how music should sound when short and sweet, like the entire punk-movement and three-chord brilliance that rears its face, still.

Music's gone as it's been more than a week, you know.

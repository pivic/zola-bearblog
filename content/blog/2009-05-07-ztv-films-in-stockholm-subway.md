En route home yesterday I managed to film a couple of people from national Swedish TV-channel Kanal 5 out trying to prank people live, by acting weirdly. Maybe this is just a bad example, but generally I like public pranks directed towards an unknown mass or people as it forces them out of their shells a bit - and that's really good for Stockholmians!

And please, keep your eye on the lady to the left in the still frame below. She can't keep it together.

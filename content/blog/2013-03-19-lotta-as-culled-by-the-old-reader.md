As [**Google Reader**](http://google.com/reader) is shutting down, I visited [**The Old Reader**](http://theoldreader.com) to find out whether it would work as [a nice alternative](http://lifehacker.com/5990881/five-best-google-reader-alternatives). I imported my Google Reader feeds and away it went. As loads of people probably try to use the service now, it's a bit slow and weird, so it threw me an error image. I didn't think it would throw me an error page with **[Lotta](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=44124300615@N01&q=lotta)**, my old Sphynx kitty, in it:

Hover with the mouse pointer ((Or use other techniques, of course.)) over the image to see the original picture, as The Old Reader probably culled from flickr.

People have asked for permission to [use Lotta's face before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=8353), but in this case the picture was simply downloaded and used _without permission_ with somewhat covert attribution, which seems to be part of [the license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/).

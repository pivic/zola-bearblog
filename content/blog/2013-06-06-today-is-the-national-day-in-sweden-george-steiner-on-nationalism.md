[George Steiner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Steiner) as [interviewed by Ronald A. Sharp for The Paris Review](http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1506/the-art-of-criticism-no-2-george-steiner).

I couldn't agree more.

> **STEINER**
> 
> What is it that justifies fully Shakespeare finding that “As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods, / They kill us for their sport”? Or his insight, “The worst is not / So long as we can say 'This is the worst'”? What has made it come true, over and over and over, that our good intentions, our compassions, our utopias turn infernal? That needs asking.

> Is nationalism a prime example for you?

> **STEINER**

> Yes. I'm much criticized for this. I detest, I abhor nationalism. I am at home wherever there is a typewriter. I regard flags, passports as dangerous trash.

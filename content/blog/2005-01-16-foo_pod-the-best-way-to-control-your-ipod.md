If you have an iPod, you're probably tired of iTunes, the program Apple pushes on ya to control what songs to use on the iPod. I was just informed of [foo\_pod](http://www.tinkafoo.com/log/foo_pod.html), a little plug-in to use with the best audio-playing software in the world, [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org). This is all for Windows though. I really like this plug-in! The only thing I'm concerned with is that foobar2000 doesn't read the albums off the iPod like albums, meaning tracks are sometimes scattered over the general window displaying what's on my iPod. I haven't used this plug-in much, but it's already better than iTunes.

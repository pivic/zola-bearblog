Apart from Döden i grytan (translates as "Death in the pot", which is as confusing to the foreigner as for us Swedes - especially as the food is delicious Italian), there are but very few mid-priced (i.e. an average price for one person, including all, is 500SKR, i.e. circa 70USD) Stockholmian restaurants I like. So, on Saturday, Mikaela, Frederic and I will venture to [Roxy](http://www.roxysofo.se), a fairly new restaurant. Their webpage is crappy, but contains a sweet menu and according to Mikaela, who has been there twice, the food and service is very good. I'm truly looking forward to it! The last good mid-priced restaurant I went to was actually Döden i grytan. DN had written them up using a lot of superlatives, and I think they deserved it all, except for the sucky service, courtesy of a very nonchalant waitress who actually sat at some friends' table, chatting away, while she was supposed to get us more wine. Anyway, the food and drink was excellent.

Another place Mikaela and I will visit as soon as our economy provides, is Guide Rouge-awarded [Bon Lloc](http://www.restaurangguiden.com/sth/vasastan/bonlloc). We have been there once, with Frederic, and I still salivate by the mere thought of it. Service was very good, and the food was truly excellent. Check out their menu! I would love to try their tasting menu, the one for 2000SKR (=280USD), for which you try an assortment of their food and their wines. If you live in Stockholm and have never been there - go.

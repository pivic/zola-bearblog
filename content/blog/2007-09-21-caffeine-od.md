![2007-09-13-coffee.jpg](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-09-13-coffee.jpg)As I was thinking about [how much fat](https://niklasblog.com/?p=738) a regular coffee in Stockholm (meaning the caffé latte) contains nowadays, I started feeling withdrawals. At times, I really long for coffee, just like other addicts. Then, I extol it; it's my morning-time panacea and Godsend. Of course, caffeine's the active substance in coffee, the executer ((Of course de-caffeinated coffee exists, but I think very few drink it in comparison with the large number of people who prefer their smack laced with caffeine.)) that transforms coffee from a mere drink into an addiction: government-supported, just like cigarettes and loads of pills, and hence OK in the eyes of most people. Unless you're the Ethiopian farmer growing the beans, getting [f-ed out of money you're due](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6086330.stm).

[Erowid](http://erowid.org) lists [the negative effects of caffeine](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_effects.shtml) as follows:

> “¢ Increases anxiety and nervousness at high doses or in sensitive individuals \[Lieberman 1992, Loke 1988\] “¢ Insomnia, decreased ability to sleep \[Smith 2002\] “¢ Caffeine withdrawal can worsen mood \[Schuh 1997\] “¢ Caffeine withdrawal causes headaches, flu-like symptoms, feelings of lethargy and reduces motivation \[Schuh 1997\] “¢ Increases jaw tension and bruxism \[Erowid Self Reports 2000, Ohayon 2001\]

Of course, you can take everything a notch further by [really overdosing](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=23901).

I've thought about the effects of caffeine on me. It's mostly [no _real_ boost in the morning](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6422279.stm), I tend to [overdose](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wear/6944026.stm) when drinking too much, I can get really nervous and twitchy, it upsets my stomach once in a while and it's socially accepted and [available everywhere](http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1991117,00.html). So, what's the option?

Tea, of course. This might sound blatantly stupid, but still: tea doesn't contain as much caffeine and hence reduces the risk of being hit by the negatives listed above. [A very fresh Swedish study](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=597&a=695095) shows that green tea may reduce the risk of developing diabetes, and [this study](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070419140910.htm) says green tea may help prevent autoimmune diseases. But this means little to somebody in the grip of coffee; if you still feel you _must_ have your coffee, have that which is marked [fair trade](http://www.fairtrade.net).

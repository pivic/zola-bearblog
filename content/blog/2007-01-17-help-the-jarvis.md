As the man's going to visit Stockholm (and a bunch of other European countries soon), [he's now asking for your help](http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=90237943&blogID=216585437&MyToken=7d1f6593-8968-4e18-a166-6e574a4adf96) to find a good local support act for every town where he's playing:

> I need your help regarding these upcoming shows - I'd like to get interesting support acts from the locality of each concert & thought maybe you might have some suggestions. So if you know of good bands/performers in or around Milan, Amsterdam, Brussels, Cologne, Hamburg, Copenhagen or Stockholm please let me know. A link to some music might be useful & the performers MUST be local 'cos the promoters can't provide much of a fee for performing.
> 
> I know you guys have impeccable taste so I'll trust you not to recommend any stinkers. Oh, & you'll have to be quick about it 'cos the first concert is on the 18th!

You know he's not Jesus Christ, even though they've got the same initials, but c'mon, don't let that supporting act waste your time! Or blog-writers who can't think of words of their own, on that note...

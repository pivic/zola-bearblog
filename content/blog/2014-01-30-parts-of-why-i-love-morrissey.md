Also, by Morrissey:

> I know they say that to be great is to be misunderstood. But Oscar Wilde is the first writer who used simplistic language so powerfully, so overwhelmingly, so amusingly. I'd never come across that before.
> 
> Although he was the most intelligent, he simplified everything. Therefore practically everybody could read Oscar Wilde and understand. He wasn't complicated. Yet he still left you lying on the bed...panting. It was so real and truthful.

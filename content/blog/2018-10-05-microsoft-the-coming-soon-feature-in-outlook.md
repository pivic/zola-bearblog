I just saw this in the top-right corner of Microsoft Outlook 365:

That's when I'd selected the button ((It's _not_ switched-on by default.)).

When I clicked the Coming Soon button, this appeared:

Nice! Not that it's summer here in Sweden any more... I clicked the link in the info above and this appeared:

This is such a far cry from when I entered my IT career as a Microsoft Office Specialist, resolving last-line support issues. That was even _before_ Microsoft started using the XML format as the base for all Microsoft Office files ((Just rename an Office file, e.g. a .docx file, to .zip and open it to see what I mean; it's all so structured and database-code-geeky beautiful now.)).

I think Microsoft is doing the right thing in allowing users to dip their toes into testing out new features _if they want to_. Microsoft has all to gain from this.

It's also nice to see how they're letting one know about the change when using the product, as seen in the screenshot above.

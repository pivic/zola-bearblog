[![Evil kitty!](http://static.flickr.com/42/98888212_740134bbf4_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=98888212)Nothing new, really, but [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-02-20.html)'s a video of Frasse. Kitten and video, I love the combination.

_The cat lounges_, which I've never actually seen happen before, but hasn't got much against [this phat kitty](http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,781386,00.html). Mother of Bog! I wonder how much people want to torment their poor creatures, before they die with fully fat-clogged veins. To think it's illegal for us to trap and force-feed other humans, but it's fairly OK when we do it to animals.

Ever since X came into my life she's done things like [this](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/niklas-i-have-been-married-for-1-year). And like [this](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2010/12/21/tout-va-tres-bien-au-contraire-pas-moi), and [this](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/why-does-niklas-e-mail-me-ego-ecstasy) and [this](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/what-should-we-do-now-drugs-paris), plus [this](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2009/11/18/square-dance-people-bagarmossen) and [this](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/me-niklas-chat-excitement-i-die). [This](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/okkervil-river-gota-kallare-may-20) too. And I've kept them and a lot of her other doings - of course not only what she's blogged - safe inside me and I look through it ever so often, or it comes crashing in on me, be it sweet, hilarious, calm, party, angry or anything else.

A lot of times I have to take a deep breath before I open that treasure chest of memories because I'm always a bit scared of how I'll react to the beauty. ((I know how it sounds, but it's true. So _there_!))

She [invited my heart](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2011-03-20-followme.gif) a long time ago and I'm following.

I know, this might look like such a big gesture, but I don't want to do anything else because the person I love is also my best friend, the one who can make me laugh when I'm in the middle of bawling my eyes out and the only one who can comfort me by really listening and offering a few words to mend me. And she makes me laugh till I suspect something to be really physically wrong with me, and makes me inadvertently smile at strangers because I'm talking to her on the phone. Being bored with her is just fine. Booty-shakin' with her in a hotel room in Paris is fine too. I'll travel anywhere with her, physically and metaphorically. And I'd jump out of an airplane without hesitation if she told me it'd be ok in the end. And there's much more about her that just opens my eyes, for _years_.

I just want to say I love you, because it's so important. I love you, X. With all of my soul and all of my heart.

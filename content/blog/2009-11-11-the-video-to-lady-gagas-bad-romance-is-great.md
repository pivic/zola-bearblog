![Ra-raah!](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2009-11-11-gaga.png) _Who said the anime days were over?_

I told myself I wouldn't blog this, but I can't stop myself.

She's wearing bespoke Alexander McQueen. Including [this shoe-model](http://www.obsessedwithshoes.com/image.axd?picture=2009%2f10%2f00620mam.jpg) off his amazing spring 2010 collection. And [her own in-ear headphones](http://ladygaga.shop.bravadousa.com/Product.aspx?pc=BGAMLG13). And [a lot of other nerdy shit](http://www.gearlive.com/news/article/q409-10-gadgets-sightings-lady-gaga-bad-romance-video). The video's directed by Francis Lawrence, who's behind clips such as Britney's "_[I'm a Slave 4 U](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QChrzTzWjz8)_".

So, can this video get any better? BOO-ya!

And I love the cheap fact that people's minds are blown by the fact that Gaga's face and hair _isn't_ very glammed-up during several shots. And what a freaking outro.

And what differs this video from [Backstreet Boys' performance at Jimmy Kimmel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Incs6VkWxY) doing "_Straight Through My Heart_" is that Gaga's choreography rules.

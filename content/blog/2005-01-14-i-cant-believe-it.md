OK people, are you ready? I've got my new phone!

Almost thrice the time it would have taken to fix this phone, its replacement is now here. I've had three verbal promises broken by Engström Telecom, faux pas committed a great number of times by them and finally, the phone has arrived.

Today I spoke to one of their service persons regarding this order. First I had to talk to a person about it all and explain they hadn't done what they should have. Here we go:

Person: Welcome to Engström Telecom. Me: Hello! \[Polite greetings from me\] I was supposed to have one Qtek 9090 delivered to me approximately two weeks ago, and it should (finally) have been received by me yesterday, but the telephone had not been sent. Why is this, and when can I have my phone, please? Person: What's your service number? Me: \[Gives Person the service number\] I expected the telephone yesterday. Person: That's not what it says here. Me: That may well be, but what I just said stands. Person: Hang on and I will connect you to the person who fixed your phone.

I get connected.

Person2: Hello, this is Person2 speaking. Me: Hello! \[Polite greetings from me, explaining the problem\] Person2: Right, I think I remember talking to you a couple of days ago. Me: Yes, that is most probably correct. Could you please tell me where my phone is? Person2: Hang on, and I'll check. This system is quite slow right now.

\[7 minutes later\]

Person2: I'll have to check this...and call you back later. Me: Fair enough, will you call me today? Person2: Yes, I will. Me: OK!

Nobody called me. Anyway, I'm now charging the new phone and will tomorrow see whether it's working or not. Exciting, exciting!

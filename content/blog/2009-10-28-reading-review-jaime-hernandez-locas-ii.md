My rating: [3 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/73599484)

Not as good as the first volume in the series about Huerta, i.e. Hopey, Maggie and their friends and enemies. This tome is centered around Maggie, Hopey and Ray (as the title implies) who are getting older, jobs and somehow finding out that they don't change as persons despite getting older.

While there are some changes in plot that slow down the tempo in here, I found some of the dada-drawn passages quite irritating, but still it's a sign of Hernandez' ability to incorporate the serious with the laughable and mash it.

The characters evolve, and even though not at the same pace as before that would have been strange. This is a quite nice assortment of little stories, and despite my missing the tempo of yore, it's nice to see the happy days and demons up close and in detail, quite poetic through the motions. Especially the dogs.

All in all: not at all as good as "Locas I" (which I give 5/5 without hesitation, but still interesting, vibrant and at times beautifully written. I'll buy the third volume as soon as it hits the streets.

I'll be moving on with reading Arthur Conan Doyle's "_The Adventure Of The Bruce-Partington Plans_" which has so far taken me over three years to read...and is a short-story. A good one at that, so I've no real idea as to why it's taken so extremely long.

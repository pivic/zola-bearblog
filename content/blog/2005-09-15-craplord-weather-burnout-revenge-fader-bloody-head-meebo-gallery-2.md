The weather in Stockholm sucks. Rain, rain, rain. I'm looking forward to "[Burnout Revenge](http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/driving/burnoutrevenge/review.html)", a new edition of "[Burnout 3](http://www.eagames.com/official/burnout/burnout3/us/home.jsp)" that I used to play until my head was ready to explode. Bring the action on! I just hope the soundtrack is better on "Revenge" than it is on "3".

I bought the new issue of [Fader Magazine](http://www.thefader.com/blog/) today. Check that link out as well, that sends you to their site, which, unlike most monthly music mag sites, are updated once in a while and contains good stuff.

Marc Quinn, most famous for creating [a sculpture of his own head](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,748937,00.html) out of nine pints of his own, congealed blood, is on again. He's created [a sculpture of a naked, pregnant woman without arms, and put it in Trafalgar Square](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4247000.stm). Good one, I say! Feminism and a kick in the head to all people stagnant. Note that the no-arms deal means the woman in question does not have any arms, it's just not a "regular bust". Still, it's quite the same old-same old type of sculpture we're all used to. Why not [Tracy Emin](http://www.whitecube.com/html/artists/tre/tre_frset.html) or [Grant Morrison](http://www.grant-morrison.com)?

I just found [meebo](http://meebo.com), a free service that allows you to log into MSN, Yahoo!, AIM and ICQ at the same time, on a dynamic web-page. It's not advanced, it's not very configurable, but it may help a lot of people who try to talk to their mates through work.

And I've upgraded [Gallery](http://gallery.sourceforge.net) to version 2.0, and that was easy. Just upload a bunch of files and serf to /upgrade. There you go.

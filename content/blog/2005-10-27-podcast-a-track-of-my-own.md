I've made a little track of my own. Yeah, I actually finished the damn thing, too! No singing, almost nothing but MIDI and samples. And a few guitar-snippets played by yours truly, some of them turned inside-out to prevent anybody from identifying them as guitar-born.

I started the project as a sort of basic electro-track with [Goblin](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:8zmtk60x9kr3)\-influences, layered it more and more, just got tired of it, and twisted the end.

If you wanna hear the track, just download it from [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/Niklas_Pivic-GeorgeBushSugerKukIHelvetet.mp3).

To make this interesting: which samples do you recognise? The person who nails the most samples by dropping them in the comments wins an album!

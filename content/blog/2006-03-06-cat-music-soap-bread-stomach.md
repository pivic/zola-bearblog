[![Chocolate rolls](http://static.flickr.com/43/108178764_72061dcad8_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=108178764) Nothing new, really, just thought I'd have to share two films with you. [This one](http://www.vimeo.com/clip=52094) shows Tussan dancing about as she thinks she'll get pet by following my hand, and [this film](http://www.vimeo.com/clip=52400) quickly displaying some street-musicians I came across as I walked around Slussen today.

I got myself a new [soap from D.R. Harris](http://www.drharris.co.uk/drharris4.htm). Finally. I love their shower gel, and now the soap. That's a very clean and healthy smell, but I wouldn't like their deodorant or eau de cologne as they're too alcoholic for me. I also picked up a sour-dough bread from Rivalbageriet, mmm.

Apart from that my stomach is in shambles from eating dinner at Mikaela's mother's house. Now, I'm not suggesting something was wrong with the food, but...this is the place where [The Grim Reaper](http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0085959/Ss/0085959/8.jpg?path=gallery&path_key=0085959) from "[The Meaning Of Life](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085959)" pops up and says "_It was the salmon mousse_."

Mikaela made some lovely biscuits made of the dark chocolate rolls you see in the picture. Looks like shit, of course, but was very nice to eat. Unlike shit. But I've never tasted shit. Bye.

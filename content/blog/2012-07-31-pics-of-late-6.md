Finally I've picked up the Nikon D70 again! No matter how shitty at it I feel, having almost solely used my mobile phone camera for months, I've finally started getting my act together by using the old cam.

While out walking yesterday, X sat down and couldn't reach the dirt with her feet.

We made this great dessert a couple of days back. A mixture of strawberries, kiwi, mint upon a bed of melted white chocolate with quark.

I love our little home town.

This went very well with a curry quorn blend that we did for wraps, plus vegetables.

Thomas made this when we visited [Trädgårdens loppis](http://www.sommarloppisen.se) this past weekend.

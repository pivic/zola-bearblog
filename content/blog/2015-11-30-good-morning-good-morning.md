Slept until 01:00. It's off. I mean, just came home from the USA, which to me means a week of adjusting until I'm back on track. I hope working out will get me back, at the least tire me out to sleep through the night. X's slept like a baby, and I'm glad for that. Now I'll delve further into the new collection of short-stories from The Paris Review and forget about the cold rain. Tindersticks keep me company, as well as that Pelikan Stresemann M400...I'm happy to finally own one. With a B nib!! Weird. Never thought I'd buy one that way.

[![Keep your eyes open - or maybe not](http://static.flickr.com/49/110920266_b0eccf6828_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=110920266) I thought I'd seen all available versions of Teddybears STHLM's "[Punkrocker](http://www.last.fm/music/Teddybears+STHLM/_/Punkrocker)", but apparently not. Torgny Melins, a Swedish dance-band outfit have made "[Dancebander](http://www.tv4.se/player/categories.aspx?treeId=10031&pid=39696&more=1)", a quite bizarre and yet, very predictable cover.

What I _really_ would like to see in Sweden, is [Pancake Mountain](http://www.pancakemountain.com/apancake.html). What's that? A TV-channel for kids, run by people who love kids, music that's not made for selling products and TV that's fun as opposed to a marketing-machine for corporations. Check that link out and you'll know what I mean. Imagine being a kid dancing around to [Shonen Knife](http://www.shonenknife.com) while they're playing live on-stage. Yeeah.

And now...for something completely USA. An art-teacher has been suspended for having recommended some of his students to try drawing nude models. Yes, it's true. Yes, because he wants his students to excel by portraying the human body - one we all have, by the way - and _that's_ sick. More on that, [here](http://drawn.ca/2006/03/11/art-teacher-suspended-for-recommending-figure-drawing-classes).

Recently, Leslie S. Klinger, author of the two quite recently released volumes titelled "The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes", announced his third volume in the series, titelled "[The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes: The Novels (A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of Four, The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Valley of Fear)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=niklasblog-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F039305800X%2Fref%3Dsib_rdr_dp)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)". I'll get it as soon as possible.

Speaking of getting, [this](http://keepvid.com) is a brilliant service that helps you to save streaming videos from a bunch of popular sites, such as YouTube and Google Video. Brilliant. Thanks to them, I now have Cannibal Corpse's "[Frantic Disembowelment](http://youtube.com/watch?v=1Dtfqy8jrg8&search=cat%20hammer)" downloaded. Note that I went on YouTube and sought for "cat hammer" (a video where a cat hit a hammer, which led to my finding that video instead. Lovely.

Wired Magazine has published [this article](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70358-0.html) on the biggest bit torrent-tracker in the world, [The Pirate Bay](http://thepiratebay.org). It's quite interesting, and helps to cast light on the legal situation of file-sharing in Sweden.

[30 Boxes](http://30boxes.com), a very up-and-coming AJAX-driven online calendar that [I've written about previously](https://niklasblog.com/?p=871), has now released an "[import tool](http://30boxes.com/import.php)" for importing data from some common calendar-applications into 30 Boxes. Before you try it, though, mind the bit named "Notes", at the end of the import-post; I'll try it carefully.

For some fun, check [this](http://reporter.blogs.com/risky/2006/03/jc_cam_demo_vid.html) punchable camera out. I'm eager for the results, especially as it's built for a feature-film that is coming, "[From Mexico With Love](http://www.frommexicowithlove.com)".

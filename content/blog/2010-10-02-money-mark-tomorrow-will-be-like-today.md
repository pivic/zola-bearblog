One of the most underestimated writers ever, [Mark Ramos-Nishita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money%20Mark), aka Money Mark.

Check out both of his top LPs, which in my mind are "_[Push The Button](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%20the%20Button%20%28Money%20Mark%29)_" and the tear-wrenching break-up album "_[Brand New By Tomorrow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand%20New%20By%20Tomorrow)_".

Bonus video: "_Maybe I'm Dead_":

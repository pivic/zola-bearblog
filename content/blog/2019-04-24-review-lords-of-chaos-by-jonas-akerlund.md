This is a very human and teenagey look into the lives of a sensational and deeply troubled bunch of humans.

Åkerlund's video-making style is obvious right from the intro, where a band is rehearsing in a basement; my first thought was "this reminds me a lot of Whale's _[Pay for Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHIGSos7rNc)_ video by...oh", and yes, it was by Åkerlund.

The most sensationalistic and easily exploitative parts of this film could have been made entirely for shock value, which I don't think they have been. Watching them, I felt completely sickened, which was heightened by the lack of music and also by the most realistic effects I've seen where suicide and murder on film is concerned.

The music itself is wondrous to see, as I dig black metal. However, the big payoff here is how youths work. It's clear for most people to see that the inner workings—and dysfunctions—of the members of Mayhem and others who made their way into this demi-shared psychosis all just wanted to fit in with their clique really badly, and all went tumbling down.

I think this is a very well-made film, on every level. I had a bit of a hard time with Culkin's acting at first, but his poser style actually works well after a while.

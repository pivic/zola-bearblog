I thought David Holmes' first single - "_[I Heard Wonders](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1671)_" - off his latest album, "The Holy Pictures", was quite original but lo and behold [Neu!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neu!)'s track "_Isi_", the first track off "[Neu!](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:9tarqj4bojaa)" from 1975, as recorded by Conny Plank ((Perhaps best known for producing/engineering Kraftwerk's first albums, later getting excommunicated and ripped off by Schneider/HÃ¼tter.)).

I love the compressed electronics on Neu!'s hypnotic, beautiful track; it's by the way from 1975! Both Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother members of [Kraftwerk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk) before leaving to do their own thing.

**Neu!'s "_Isi_"**

  

**David Holmes' "_I Heard Wonders_"**

Even though I think the tracks are more than coincidentally similar, fair game to Holmes for having made a very nice album. But if there's a next time we'll be waiting in the wings, you musically great Irish hairdresser!

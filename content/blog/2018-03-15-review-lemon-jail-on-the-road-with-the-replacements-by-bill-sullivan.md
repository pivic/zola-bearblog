I truly liked this book. Bill Sullivan, mainly roadie for The Replacements, has now issued this book, a memoir of his daze and haze while touring the 'Mats in the 1980s. This is an excellent addition to Bob Mehr's absolutely brilliant "Trouble Boys", one of the best books of its year, which is wholly on the band.

Sullivan has added a lot of nice self-taken pics of the bands, along with a mass of descriptions of the infernalia, paraphernalia, and self-destructive mayhem that the band always stood for, including descriptions of their infamous MTV stint, wearing Tom Petty's wife's clothes on stage, completely trashing their tour van, to unintentionally smuggling drugs abroad, breaking guitars on purpose just to see whether they actually can be fixed, to playing five-hour sets just to make the one paying punter leave, and (let's not forget this) making Lemmy think The Replacements were TOO LOUD.

It's a fun ride, reminding us that alcohol is a drug and fuck, could someone please start taking the music business a little less seriously again, please?

[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-22-atrthumb.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-22-atr.jpg)[This is a podcast on Atari Teenage Riot](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-22-atr.mp3) \[MP3, VBR ~128Kbps, ~16MB\], a group which exists no more, but that I loved and still do. They were explosive, volatile, extremely loud, very do-everything-yourself, funky, breakbeat-laden (oh don't you just miss the breakbeat era?) and very political. Their music hit me hard, and the members felt really original. Right up my street. Do check the podcast out, and then go off and buy their music.

**Edit**: you have to check out [this page](http://ainfos.de/downloads/videos) where there's a video from ATR performing live on the streets of Berlin on the first of January 1999. It's a cut-up which shows how German police beat up innocent demonstrators and also how the demonstrators rise up and chase the police away - only to be attacked back more brutally, of course. The video also shows top clips like Alec Empire shouting "Fuck the police!" into a mic just a yard from the nearest cop, staring him in the face. At the end you'll see ATR being arrested.

Here's a list of resources connected with the band:

[Digital Hardcore Recordings](http://www.digitalhardcore.com): here you'll find a lot of info on the band. This is the site of Alec Empire's biggest label.

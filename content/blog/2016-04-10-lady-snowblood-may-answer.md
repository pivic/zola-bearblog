"_[Lady Snowblood](https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/1154-the-complete-lady-snowblood)_" is a film that came out in 1973.

To say it's a vengeance film would almost be vague.

Fast-forward until a time when Lady Snowblood has turned somewhat older, takes a walk among the flowers, and identifies political issues that would be highly valid and massively important 43 years after the film was made:

Who wouldda thunk it?

What would be a better way to describe our current times, even though I can't say how much I'd love for an anti-capitalistic assassin to suddenly appear. I mean, economic-based criminals don't get more than a slap on the wrist if they're caught, while the not-super-wealthy (i.e. more than 99.9% of the population) pay for it.

Perhaps the answer is our 87-year-old guru, Noam Chomsky:

By the way, that's not just about the USA.

Where are our assassins?

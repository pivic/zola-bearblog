I've just won [a Slimfold Wallet](http://slimfoldwallet.com/?page_id=5)! Yeay!

It's a wallet mainly made using [Tyvek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyvek), which is a material that I saw used on a building site near work today:

Devo rocked outfits made entirely of the material, by the way. It's water-proof and nice. The wallet is so far really nice, but creases some. Still, it's not warm (unlike leather wallets, even small ones) and is extremely light-weight.

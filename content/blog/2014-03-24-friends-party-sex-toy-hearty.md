Went to a party on Saturday that was hosted by Tobias, or rather, by Tobias' company, [Oliver & Eva](http://www.oliverocheva.se), suppliers of sex toys and related stuffs, with an [ethically nice twang](http://www.oliverocheva.se/vara-varderingar) to it.

It's been years since I set foot in Spy Bar, one of the few places in Stockholm that are open past 3am. We ventured! We had fun! There was a cotton candy machine and a popcorn machine in place, loads of people and oak furniture, apart from the DJ playing old hip-hop classics I haven't heard in ages; I somehow didn't imagine hearing Cypress Hill's "_[Hand On The Pump](http://youtu.be/G1SwN70b0bw)_" anytime soon when I walked through the main gates, I tell you what. They even played "_Crazy In Love_"...!

People were everywhere, and as Tobias graciously pushed drink tickets into our hands, we got ourselves goodie bags from a fishpond! had more sugar spun candy and said hi to Bo and oh, he's such a nice guy, here's actually a fireplace and can we sit somewhere? and people poured in and hi Tobias your party is going down a hoot and what about your dialect, where's it from? the music's really great and retro and I love all you guys and - an after party!

It was really fun, open-hearted, honest and what I needed. Now go visit [Tobias' site](http://www.oliverocheva.se) and get lucky!

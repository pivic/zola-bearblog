[![The Unwritten Vol. 4: Leviathan](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1319659021m/11142767.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11142767)[The Unwritten Vol. 4: Leviathan](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11142767) by [Mike Carey](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9018) My rating: [3 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/175092930)  
This is a logical, slower step forward in this canon. Unfortunately, it's all a bit same-old, but the fantasies don't stop coming. In my eye, the very last bit in this book regarding Tommy is the best, including the very last chapter which isn't about him at all, but about the continuing saga in the life of a very nasty and desperate psychopath.

I'm looking forward to part 5, dropping in January 2012.

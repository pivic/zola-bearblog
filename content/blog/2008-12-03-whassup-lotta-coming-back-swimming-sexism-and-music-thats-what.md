Yesterday I e-mailed the breeder who we borrowed Lotta from; her Kismet who's got a little kitty that currently carries the unborn spawn that X and I will acquire ((Jaysis, how cynically industrial doesn't that sound?)) for our pleasures. Hopefully, it will love us as much as I think we will love it. And it seems like we're going to borrow Lotta a bit earlier than we'd hoped for! Happiness is just 'round the bend, if itineraries allow for it.

Swimming. Hell yeah! Swimming's the latest craze, at least if you're me. Swimming is taking care of my decrepit left arm and bad back; I'm trying to do more yoga now, and it's going well.

Oh, did you hear Amanda Palmer ((Half of Dresden Dolls.))'s label Roadrunner called her fat and asked for her to remove cut shots from [the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYSULkXcVYw) for her solo song "_Leeds United_"? From [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/dec/03/dresden-dolls-roadrunner) off The Guardian:

> Her fans - women, mainly, but a few men too - started sending pictures of their own bellies to Roadrunner in protest, and the Rebellyon movement ([www.therebellyon.com](http://www.therebellyon.com)) was born, celebrating stomachs of all shapes and sizes.

Bitch record label! And said article signs off well with exposing them as the sexists they are:

> And it is worth noting that Roadrunner's unease with tubby tummies appears to apply only to its female artists. A look at the label's other bands, including Megadeth and Slipknot, reveals some stomachs that are hardly Beckham-esque in their proportions.

Speaking of music, it's time for me to collate my mind and create a post of what I think was the best of 2008. November has spawned ((Pun _wasn't_ originally intended.)) an awful lot of great music, so I'm thinking that by the time I post my opinions, December will have got the better of me. Well, not likely; I think it's more likely that we'll get to see horrible xmas-compilations and cash-in-releases before great ones by artistic individuals, e.g. Christina Aguilera and her philistine likes.

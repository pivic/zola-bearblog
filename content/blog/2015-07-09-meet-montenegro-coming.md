I've been keen on seeing "[_Meet Me In Montenegro_](http://meetmeinmontenegro.me)" ever since bumping into the makers/stars of the movie-cum-documentary in question by happenstance; I really liked Holdridge's previous film, "[_In Search Of A Midnight Kiss_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0989000)", which was filled with great Okkervil River/Shearwater music, but this... I mean, family on my dad's side from Serbia, so Montenegro is close to that. And I love Berlin, that's what. I've got high hopes for the soundtrack, regardless of the contents!

The film's premiere in the USA is tomorrow, so I'm hoping for it to be available in Sweden soon.

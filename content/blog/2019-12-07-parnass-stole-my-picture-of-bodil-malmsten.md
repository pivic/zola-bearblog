A few weeks ago, I contacted the magazine Parnass and ordered their most current issue, one that's almost entirely dedicated to Bodil Malmsten. Finally! A mag almost entirely about one of my fave authors and poets, ever!

Imagine my surprise when I opened the mag and saw one of the pictures that I've taken of Bodil; I was uncredited! The fucking audacious pricks had just stolen my shit!

I emailed them to call me as soon as possible. Their Editor-in-Chief did, acted lackadaisically and told me "this is the only time this has ever happened".

I don't give a fuck! You still stole from me, you thieving bitches! I didn't put it that way over the phone, but that's the gist of what I said.

From that bullshit excuse to "oh, we found so many pictures of Bodil online" as a faux excuse - to which I told her that doesn't give her the right to steal shit - to teaching her that a simple Google image search could have found my original picture online; from her "I don't think we can add a correction to our next episode because I'm stepping down as Editor-in-Chief" to getting her to say "I guess we have to add a correction in our next issue"...eugh.

I told her I didn't want money because I knew they were a small magazine and basically had done a great thing by writing a lot about literature.

A lot of pictures that I've made available on the net are there with a Creative Commons license that not only allow anybody to use them freely for non-commercial purposes, but people are allowed to edit them as well if they want to. I've had everybody from companies to individuals ask if they could use my pictures. I've only turned nefarious companies down, for example The Sun and Koch Industries. Fuck them to hell.

If somebody makes money from someone else's work: don't fuck them over. The truth will come out!

If you do wrong, apologise honestly.

If you don't want to apologise for behaving badly, be your awful self.

You can't have it both ways.

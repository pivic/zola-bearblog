Mikaela has taught me the so-called second sun-salutation of Ashtanga Yoga series one. Now I do five repetitions of the first one, then five repetitions of the second, in a row. It's very demanding, yet I feel how my body is stretching more and more, and I'm building triceps muscles as I keep training. My ankle-muscles keep stretching which is great, especially since I never did the required stretching-exercises much after I twisted my left ankle badly. I sound like Tom Cruise when he's saying what scientology has meant to him, but this is the real thing. My breathing's even started working better; even though it may be due to a placebo effect - I don't really care if it is, as the effect is the raw deal - I have used my asthma machine _once_ in a little more than three weeks, which I otherwise used once or twice a day.

Today I'll either lunch at Nitty Gritty Café or at Kafé Tjärlek. The second was alright, but I havent been at the first one; the guy who runs that café has prepared and baked everything available by himself, and the prices are low. I'm afraid the lunches are tiny, though, but we'll see. [Here](http://www.nittygritty.se/shop/default.aspx?menu=66&site=232)'s the menu from the place. As you'll see, that bowl looks tiny, compared with the loaf of bread. Going there would be great just for a coffee, as the espresso price is low and that espresso is very tasty. I have to tell you the guy who runs the shop is very nice and gives great service. Besides, I've got to check [the Kim Jones shoes](http://www.nittygritty.se/kimjones.jpg) out in real life.

I got the new Canon printer yesterday! Too bad I can't show you just how good the pictures are. After installing the drivers one had to run a calibration test, which didn't require any user interaction. How about that? I then printed some pictures on the finest Canon photo-paper, one A4 page using their high-definition paper, a few credit card-size prints and even printed on a CD. Everything turned out great, and the printer has _speed_. So far, I'm very satisfied.

P.s. Don't feel frustrated at your computer like this [dude](http://files.z9.ru/lj/20050712/klaves.gif).

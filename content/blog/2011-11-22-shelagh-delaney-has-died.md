![Shelagh Delaney](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/21/1321882087733/The-playwright-Shelagh-De-007.jpg "Shelagh Delaney")

While we were visiting Manchester this weekend, [Shelagh Delaney](http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/nov/21/playwright-shelagh-delaney-dies) died. I didn't know this until now. She was born in Salford, a borough of Manchester where The Smiths had now-infamous portraits of them taken outside Salford Lads Club, which we also visited; one of said pictures is found [here](http://www.creativematch.com/newsfiles/27494/450/salfordladsclub_smiths.jpg).

If you're wondering who she was, Morrissey once said "I've never made any secret of the fact that at least 50 per cent of my reason for writing can be blamed on Shelagh Delaney." and he's written a heartfelt eulogy [here](http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_111121_02).

I can safely and lovingly blame my wife for screening "**[A Taste of Honey](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055506)**" for me the first time around, and I last hummed a tune from it while walking towards Morrissey's old house on Kings Road. If you haven't seen the film, do yourself a favour and do it soon.

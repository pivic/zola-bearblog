What's to say about Manchester? Well...loads! But this goes a long, long way:

Seeing the above picture sends shivers through me! Travelling with X is one of the most special and treasured things in my life. I mean, going to Manchester with _her_, to a city that has spawned innumerable bands that I cherish, is just...slightly too much to fully take in. As was the feeling of reaching Salford Lads Club one day, when we just walked over from the city center. We took pictures, and a police riot van just showed up. As X took pictures of me it just pulled up, there were a few bobbies clothed in neon garb who looked at us through the car windows. I tried looking most non-threatening back at them, and they left in their ridiculously huge vehicle. And we took more pictures, and then a man showed up and asked if we were Smiths fans. He called Leslie, the curator of the Smiths Room inside SLC, i.e. a room filled with memorabilia. That was just unbelievable. More pics were taken. I felt giddy as a schoolboy staying inside a veritable womb of trivia from a band that I've loved for so long, e.g. Morrissey's shirt from the video for "_The Boy With The Thorn In His Side_", fan-made posters and pics of fans, not to mention the pictures of The Smiths are here.

Staying in Manchester meant fulfilling a dream. Not having planned much what/where/when was a main thing = no stress!

A lot of the houses in Manchester are brown brick, often dilapidated. They made me feel a bit like coming home, in a strange way. Manchester is an industrial town at its core: big buildings, rivers flowing under brick bridges, the pedestrian streets outside the city centre aren't always paved with asphalt, big chimneys seen from almost wherever you are, it's quite spacious.

We distanced ourselves a bit from this by venturing into the Manchester Christmas Markets, which was really lovely. Gl√ºhwein and loads of people. Warmth in the middle of winter.

Also saw Neon Indian and Okkervil River live; the first gig wasn't intended but just happened, really! It was all really weird because we stepped in at the venue for lunch and happened to see a little poster saying he was playing the same night. And we spoke with Mr. Palomo himself and he was really nice. I loved walking up to X, acting all casual, with Neon Indian at my side to say hi. I just wish I could have captured X's expression on video that time, absolutely brilliant.

We walked, ate and explored. Music, life, love. [X's written about Manchester](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2011/11/25/manchester-madness-november-2011-%E2%99%A1/) in a really lovely way, like a takeaway

I shan't say more about the trip. I always tend to write about every little detail but not this time. Below's a little gallery of pics; one's more than a thousand words, et.c. Enjoy.

[![New do](http://static.flickr.com/43/91493297_0cbbaa028a_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=91493297)Yeah, I'm back from having had my head cut correct, but [not like Anthony Mason](http://www.lyricsmania.com/lyrics/beastie_boys_lyrics_1857/ill_communication_lyrics_4411/b-boys_makin'_with_the_freak_freak_lyrics_52866.html). Anyway, I'm always happy when leaving my hair-dresser, especially as she combines excellent hair-dressing with great house-music.

As usual though, I've got loads of links for yo asses as this week has entailed nothing but work.

I've ordered [the new version](http://www.uncrate.com/men/entertainment/dvd/ferris-buellers-day-off-bueller-bueller-edition-002664.php) of "[Ferris Beuller's Day Off](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/combined)", a film I've not seen since the early nineties, but one that I have fond memories of.

It's interesting to see that somebody who is not [Rockstar Games](http://www.rockstargames.com) has hacked GTA [for multiplayer gaming](http://light.mtavc.com).

I wish I could laugh at it in full, but [this](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4630808.stm) is just horrific. Talk about a sort of backlash against thinking! What's science, then? Here you go:

> The state or fact of knowing; knowledge or cognizance of something specified or implied; also, with wider reference, knowledge (more or less extensive) as a personal attribute. Now only Theol. in the rendering of scholastic terms (see quot. 1728), and occas. Philos. in the sense of “˜knowledge' as opposed to “˜belief' or “˜opinion'.

Hence, the "more than three quarters" of the youths who said scientists were "really brainy people" either think they're pretty brainy themselves, or they don't know what they're going on about, which reminds me of the old "[beyond reasonable doubt](https://niklasblog.com/?p=827)"-item that's spawned through the American judicial system (among others, I'm afraid). By the way, I got the definition for "science" from Oxford English Dictionary Online, available for free this month only, so check it out [here](http://www.oed.com/bbcwords).

Did I mention that Google are turning into a nightmare? [I did](https://niklasblog.com/?p=867). Anyway, now [they've removed their proud banner saying "we're against censorship"](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/27/google_doesnt_censor). Lovely. Bastards.

Speaking of nightmares, check [this](http://www.us-cert.gov/current/services_ports.html) list of ports. For nerds only.

I just ordered [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3822840998) Taschen-book on fashion. Very interesting, tipped by [Manolo](http://shoeblogs.com).

I like [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/dining/25note.html) on a food critic's week as a waiter. Very interesting. From the article:

> "People are hungry, and then they're drinking," he noted. "Two of the worst states that people can be in."
> 
> I recall a young woman at a six-top who bounced in her seat as she said, in a loud singsong voice: "Where's our sangria? Where's our sangria?" Her sangria was on the way, although she didn't seem to need it, and the bouncing wasn't going to make it come any faster.

Speaking of beasts, Harry Belafonte recently called George W. Bush the biggest terrorist. Very good one, especially as Mr. Belafonte knows what he's talking about. What about [this](http://edition.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/01/24/belafonte.bush.ap/index.html), then?

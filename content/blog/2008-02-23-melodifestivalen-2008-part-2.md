The above stats that Tomas highlights in [this post](http://schlagerkung.blogg.se/1203697782_en_sensation.html) are very interesting, especially if they're real. I sincerely wish that Carola would have been beaten by a bunch of Serbia-sell-outs, either just for a laugh or to wake Carola up - which probably is just wishful thinking, as she thinks she's christian - but I don't think that'll happen. It was so close!

The second installment in this series kicked off in Västerås, out of all god-forsaken places in Sweden. I actually don't remember much of the artists due to immense amounts of alcohol that Zak and X forced me to drink because, frankly, all of it was bubblegum music. Nothing wrong with that! [Ramones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ramones) are bubblegum music as well, but not _bad_ like some, i.e. Rongedal, two baldies who won the crowd by...being bald and wearing red blazers. Obviously. I even prefer Mika to them.

This being said, I'll let my friends [Tomas](http://schlagerkung.blogg.se/1203246884_razborka.html) and [Whitechalk](http://www.piratkatter.com/?p=27) sum up last Saturday's contest, in Swedish.

I'm hoping for more action tonight, when the third installment is due.

**Bonus action**:

As I walked through Medborgarplatsen yesterday, a bunch of girls were dancing in sub-human temperatures, apparently being filmed. I got the feeling they'd do well in Melodifestivalen, if they were a feature. Why? Because they were not singing. Hahahaha. Err.

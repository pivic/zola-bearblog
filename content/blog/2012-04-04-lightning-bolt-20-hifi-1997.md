Wee! From [the boys' Bandcamp site](http://lightningbolt.bandcamp.com):

> "20" was recorded on August 11, 1997 in Fort Thunder R.I. on the old Tascam 424 cassette 4 track Chippendale's high school band had bought in the late 80's. LB recorded 3 takes over three days. Take 1 is thin and take 3 is rockin but the bass drum pedal breaks at the 19 minute mark, so here is take 2. Apparently the session was recorded over a tape of an older recording making the sound even more HiFi than usual. Budgets were tight back then and a new cassette was not in the cards. (So you may have to crank the bass a bit).

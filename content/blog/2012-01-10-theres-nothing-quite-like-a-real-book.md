It's true. E-books haven't eradicated the old ones and they never will.

I think I'll somehow always be more affected by material stuff rather than electronics and all good that goes with it. Just as a picture says more than a thousand words, a slap in the face will always be more than a "ur stuped lolz".

Right now I'm reading a book that X gave me for xmas - "_[32/2011](http://www.albertbonniersforlag.se/Bocker-auto/Bokpresentationssida/?isbn=9789100126933)_" - a Swedish poetry anthology that's really good. And I love holding it my hands.

As it unfurls in my hands it's a magic experience. I'd love to design a book cover that evolves in a reader's hands, sprawling into the atmosphere, dazzling and challenging people on the subway.

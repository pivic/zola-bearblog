As [Muxtape](http://muxtape.com) is still in hiatus, I'm ditching it for [Posterous](http://posterous.com). So, hencewith, you'll find tracks I love right [here](http://pivic.posterous.com).

As Glasvegas are releasing their eponymous debut album today, I've kicked things off at my Posterous by releasing the first track off said album. It's funny to hear it as the CD sounds much like the ripped vinyls I've heard. They've really aimed for a dirtied Wall of Sound ((As created by Phil Spector.)) with loads of reverb. True to their Scottish roots, it's all The Jesus and Mary Chain and The Ronettes. I really like it, and am quite smitten by the singer's lyrics at times, even though the main attraction for me are the vocal flexing paired with the guitars and general reverby sound.

Thanks to the beauty that is Soundcloud, I've shared an old mix I DJ'ed together. It's two hours long and quite eclectic, ranging from Super Furry Animals to Hollywood soundscapes, Swedish hip-hop to Teenage Fanclub, Alec Empire, Clawfinger, Portishead and Sparks.

Too bad I went lazy two thirds into it! I've commented most of the tracks [here](http://soundcloud.com/pivic/dj-pivic-rum-and-the-lash-mix); you'll see the comments as you listen. Now I've got Jimmy Bo Horne's "_Let Me Be Your Lover_" looping in my mind... Hear it from 11:55 in the mix.

I'll soon post another mix that I'm more proud of. Why I didn't upload that instead of this? Because I can't find it, ha! So much for preserving...

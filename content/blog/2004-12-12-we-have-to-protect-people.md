[This great article by Gary Taylor from The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,1369643,00.html) shows how Bush and his non-intellectual cohorts tries to ban all things homosexual, pointing the finger at the very, very naughty (and hence, very non-christian) Internet. Turn the other cheek then, you fuckers. No, the _other_ type of cheek.

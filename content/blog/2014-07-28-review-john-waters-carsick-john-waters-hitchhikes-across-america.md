[![Carsick: John Waters Hitchhikes Across America](http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1396825449m/18490657.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490657)[Carsick: John Waters Hitchhikes Across America](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490657) by [John Waters](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17366)  
My rating: [2 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/962514304)  
  
I didn't get the fact that the first two parts of this book were complete fiction until after a few rides into the first part; that's all what Waters wanted his trip to be, the second part is what Waters imagined how the trip would be if it were as horrible as possible, and the third part is - according to Waters - the trip as it really happened.

Yes, the third part is the most interesting. Like Chuck Palahniuk, Waters managed to gross me out in his first part (not at the start) and the second part just bored me, but the third part, where his escaped his storytelling and actually started telling the story as it happened, is far and beyond the most interesting part to me, where boredom and other persons' stories are included.

So, why is Waters going on a hitchhike and writing a book about it?

> What am I trying to prove here? I mean, I’m not bored. An ex-convict woman I recently met claimed her criminal past was not a result of a bad childhood but just because she “wanted an adventure.” I do, too. Kicks. But hasn’t writing and directing fifteen movies and penning six books made me feel complete? My career dreams already came true years ago and what I do now is all gravy. Shouldn’t I be retiring rather than sticking out my thumb? Retiring to what, though? Insanity?

> Will I be safe? I know serial killers routinely pick up hitchhikers and murder them, but aren’t the victims, unfortunately, usually young female hookers? Yeah, yeah, I know about Herb Baumeister, “the I-70 Strangler,” who choked at least sixteen gay men to death, but he picked them up in gay bars, not on exit ramps of truck stops. Yet I must admit even truckers I know are fairly nuts.

Well, he wasn't murdered by a serial killer. Hope I didn't spoil anything for you by writing this. On the other hand, he writes a lot about how twittered-of his adventure on the road was.

The book would have been more interesting if Waters hadn't had access to his credit cards or his smartphone.

All in all: I wish only the non-fiction part would have been in here; that's at the end of the book. Otherwise, it's a semi-interesting read. Waters is eccentric in a good way, and that's interesting to read, but his free-wheelin' fictional stories are better left to films, if you ask me.

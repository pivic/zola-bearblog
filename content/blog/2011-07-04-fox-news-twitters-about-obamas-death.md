[![Fox News Twitter: Obama's dead](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2011-07-04-foxnewsobama.jpg "Fox News Twitter: Obama's dead")](https://niklasblog.com/?attachment_id=7453)

Yes, [they were hacked](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2011/jul/04/fox-news-hacked-twitter-obama-dead). I don't think that's the most interesting bit about this.

I'm thinking that a lot of people who know [what Fox News really is about](http://dropfox.com/blog/201106200021) also know enough to challenge _any_ info from Fox as soon as it's released.

Another part of me is just sad knowing that a lot of people automatically believe what Fox News says is true.

I strongly recommend "_[Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfoxed)_", a brilliant documentary about the start, rise and stay of Fox News. You can stream the documentary in its entirety [here](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6737097743434902428), from Google Video.

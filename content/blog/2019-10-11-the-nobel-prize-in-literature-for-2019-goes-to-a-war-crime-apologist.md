I've nothing against Olga Tokarczuk, let's make that clear.

Peter Handke, however, is another thing.

To quote Slavoj Žižek:

In 2014, Handke called for the Nobel to be abolished, saying it was a ‘false canonisation’ of literature. The fact that he got it now proves that he was right. This is Sweden today: an apologist of war crimes gets a Nobel prize \[...\]

After [the sex-abuse scandals that surrounded The Swedish Academy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/world/europe/nobel-literature-swedish-academy.html), made several members of the board leave, and the main man thrown in jail, The Swedish Academy hands a few million Swedish crowns—nearly a million Euro—to a man who denies the Srebrenica genocide (and attends war criminal Miloševi?’s funeral).

Wow. Can't say I'm surprised by this. After all, they have awarded Kissinger and Obama the Nobel peace prize, which goes to show what a Nobel prize is worth.

Too bad it sometimes hits the mark and enables a lot of well-deserved people to do their research, writing, and so forth, without having to gravel and/or starve.

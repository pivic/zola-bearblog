![Andy B](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-02-22-andrewbird.jpg)[Andrew Bird](http://www.andrewbird.net) came to me ((No pun intended.)) with his album "The Mysterious Production of Eggs", which I rather enjoyed. His new album, "[Armchair Apocrypha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armchair_Apocrypha)", is even better; it's released on [Fat Possum Records](http://www.fatpossum.com), a label mostly known for its impressive number of blues-musicians like R.L. Burnside and Furry Lewis, but also for alternatives like Dinosaur Jr. and blues-rockers The Black Keys.

His sound is interesting. His music shows signs of meticulous production, great composition (he's musically educated through [the Suzuki method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_method)) and a wide selection of instruments, while retaining a good sense for melodies, song and orchestration.

Bird's music is mostly catchy and modernistic at the same time. I'm constantly amazed at the amount of good music that's released nowadays, and Bird definitely fits in with the young 'uns out there, making exciting stuff.

You'll find audio-samples at [his MySpace-site](http://www.myspace.com/andrewbird).

As usual, this track will be removed after a week has passed. Go get! Here's "Heretics".

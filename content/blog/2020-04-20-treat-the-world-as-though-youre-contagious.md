When I'm out walking people run about. Joggers get much closer to me than most people do; I've no idea why, but they do.

They huff and froth saliva, as joggers do.

I'd be completely fine with that if we weren't in a pandemic.

I have a suggestion to make:

Let's all act as though you're contagious: you've got COVID-19 and it's your responsibility to stay away from people in order not to infect them.

I think that would improve matters, especially for the solipsists. I'm not trying to sound clever when writing this, but think that people who are likely to infect others and not care about physical distancing need to try other tricks.

Like the swan, stay the fuck away. Thank you.

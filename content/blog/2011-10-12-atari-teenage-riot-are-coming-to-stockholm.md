![ATR](http://static.eventful.com/images/blackborder500/I0-001/004/271/945-3.jpeg "We're so haaaard!") _I'm shyyy, don't look at mee! - NO! We're so hardcore it must show in ZE PICTURE!_

I've loved this band for ages. I don't necessarily agree with all they're into, but a lot of things, politically speaking.

They're finally coming to Stockholm! Last time they were here was in 1997 at the Lollipop festival, sadly one of the times I didn't attend! So come November I predict my seeing them live for the first time, in the midst of strobe lights, breakbeats and deafness unless ear-plugs are used.

Here are a few remembrance vids:

This is "_Speed_", the track that made me discover them late one night through "Alternative Nation" on MTV.

That's from the 1st of May 1999 Berlin demonstrations that turned into rioting, showing how ATR played into it all.

That's a seldom-seen version with Alec Empire's commentary on top, all in black-and-white.

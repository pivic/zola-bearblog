[Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-12-19) are some pictures of the computer desk. The only thing that's boring, is that the audio cable doesn't reach the full way and that the keyboard is so high up that it's impossible to write anything for three full minutes without feeling completely numb and pain running through one's arms. Hence, I will leave now!

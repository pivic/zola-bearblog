It seems marvellous guitarist Robert Fripp and multi-instrumentalist jack-of-many-trades Brian Eno have made a somber album with "[The Equatorial Stars](http://www.enoshop.co.uk/index.php?product_id=21)". Eno, who often uses [Oblique Strategies](http://www.rtqe.net/ObliqueStrategies), a deck of cards designed to be of inspiration. More about that [here](http://www.rtqe.net/ObliqueStrategies/OSintro.html).

The album is very calm. Fripp uses his strings with warmth and electronic manipulation. This is like ERA without the awful yelling accompanied by Enya strings and the feeling the guys who have made this is over 50 years old. And it still sounds good, if you're up for it, despite the fact that I hate f-ing ERA and Enya.

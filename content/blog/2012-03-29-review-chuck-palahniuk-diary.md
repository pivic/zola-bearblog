[![Diary](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1320550983m/22284.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22284) [Diary](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22284) by [Chuck Palahniuk](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2546)  
My rating: [3 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/299334818)  
  
This is my least favourite Palahniuk book, and I'll tell you why. It feels like 1970s horror film turned into a book, while filling it like a turkey with Palahniukisms.

It's got atmosphere and is well-written, but feels quite empty. And yes, cinematic. And quite lonely. At times it's funny and a bit scary, and it's even hard to put away but all in all I'd much rather recommend "Rant" or "Snuff".

Today Sebastian, Alexander and Evelina came over to pick us up. We then went to Myrorna to pick up the sofa. When I first saw it, I wasn't exactly prepared for how orange it was. Mikaela had said red, so red I presumed it was, but it's all in the vast array of pictures shown [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-08-16). Mind you, a lot of the pictures show Hendrix, one of Mikaela's mother's two cats (the other one is called Tussan) , and parts of the lovely dinner we had at Mikaela's parents' place. I like how the new TV-bench is coming along, as the "old one" is too big.

Anyway, there is a few QuickTime films available; Sebastian and Alexander lifting the sofa while I work hard at filming (and laughing at) them is [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-08-16-moving.mov) \[2,8MB\], a film of Hendrix lolling about is [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-08-16-hendrix.mov) \[6,4MB\], a little view of Tussan right before it went into battle with a neighbour cat (which, unfortunately, I could not capture on film) is [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-08-16-tussan.mov) \[4,7MB\] and at last, a film of Hendrix cleaning itself is [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-08-16-hendrixcleaning.mov) \[8,3MB\]

We all had a nice time, and ate the delicious food that Mikaela's mom had made. The grilled salmon was amazing with beans and a sauce that was incredible. Even Mikaela's dad, who has a hard-to-please-taste, liked the sauce especially. We then retired to the first floor and ate lovely pies for dessert, while we watched a few Spike Jonze videos from [his collection](http://www.palmpictures.com/videos/theworkofdirectorspikejonze.html) , which we started on as Evelina has done rhythmic gymnastics (I have no idea if that is the correct term for it) and this was displayed somewhat in Jonze's video for The Chemical Brothers' "[Elektrobank](http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/disco/videos/elektro/medium.html)" \[streaming MOV\]. We then went over to [Extreme Home Makeover](http://abc.go.com/primetime/xtremehome)", a show where a host who gives a poor family a complete house "makeover", which means they get a lot of talented people the chance to re-make a house and its interior, while they ship the family off to Disney World. Oh yes, Disney World. No, [I don't know if they make any potential gay members of the family wear red t-shirts](http://www.gayday.com/news/2000/orlando_weekly_000531a.asp). Anyway, the [host](http://a.abc.com/primetime/xtremehome/images/bios/bio_pennington.jpg) of the show is a man with little calm and no hair-dresser. He probably lives on caffeine and seems to spend most of his time to cover up his amphetamine abuse. He's extremely tense. The family of the evening were given a new home containing a recording studio (where they could record their country music). They were also treated to a "gold CD" by Lee Ann Rimes, a country singer. She popped up at the place, and sang "Amazing Grace", which was slightly better than any of [Christina Aguilera's christmas songs](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004Y7SF/pd_ka_4/026-9704818-7831635). Side-note: if you ever hate somebody, give them that album. What a show. I love watching really poor people get great stuff that enhances their lives, so this was a let-down.

Now it's time to learn to go to bed earlier. Work starts next Monday, blargh.

[Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-07-03) you'll find a few pictures from yesterday and today! Speaking of which, today Mikaela and I visited my parents. Grandma also popped by and we ate dinner and ate a strawberry tart that dad made. We all had a good time, but our visit was cut short from me having problems with my allergies.

A bunch of pictures included in this batch are from my walking around Fru√§ngen. Since I acquired my new camera, Mikaela and I have been having a discussion: is it immoral not to ask somebody's permission if you want to take their picture? Maybe "immoral" should be swapped for "unethical", but you get the gist. On reading through my blogroll today, I happened to stumble onto [this blog post](http://claytoncubitt.com/blogs/usedfuture/2005/07/philip-lorca-dicorcia-sued.html) that describes a photographer who took a man's picture (without his knowledge) a few years back, sold copies of it for 20000 USD a piece (!) and then got sued by said man. Well, I don't know. I'd probably sell a picture if I couldn't get hold of the subject in any way. One does, however, have to stay by the law, and above the morals of everyday tabloid photographers who don't care the least about what the subject thinks, no matter what the picture features (or seems to give light of). If I take somebody's picture, and he/she tells me to erase it, I would.

Oh, [a new Velvet Underground compilation](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/v/velvet-underground/gold.shtml) is on its way. Maybe that'll get me listening to them in a big way. I plowed through their demos when those were released - before I'd heard anything else by VU - and since then I haven't heard anything beside the hits. Maybe now I'll get what's coming to me. It's strange, that; some times you end up not listening to the most awed artists in the world despite thousands of opportunities. What the hell, I've a lifetime ahead of me to do that in.

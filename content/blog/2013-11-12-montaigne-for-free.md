[![Michel de Montaigne](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2013-11-12_1120.png)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2013-11-12_1120.png)

While perusing the effing Internet, I just found word that [**Michel de Montaigne**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne)'s works are of course, as he raved around more than 500 years ago, available for free. Both in [multi-format downloads](http://manybooks.net/titles/montaignetext02mn20v11.html), and also [as audio books](http://librivox.org/author/5004?primary_key=5004&search_category=author&search_page=1&search_form=get_results).

If you're in the dark as to who Montaigne was, please check [this book](https://niklasblog.com/?p=12917) out; it changed and, kind of, verified my perception on a lot of shit. Montaigne lived over half a millenium ago, but his thoughts and sentiments are forever, and should ring true in most people.

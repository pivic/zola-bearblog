I've waited for this for such a long time, and now it's reality; George W. Bush is no longer president of the USA. Not that he could have stayed one, but still. I mean, Hitler declared all other parties invalid just as Bush's government caused the USA a lot of horrendous things, for instance [the patriot act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_PATRIOT_Act) and sending the USA into a financial abyss.

Any contender is better than John McCain and Sarah Palin, except for George W. Bush's administration, of course. Possible additions: Stalin, Hitler, Pot. Maybe.

Now it's time to see what will happen in the US. It'll probably take decades for them to turn things around properly, but it all has to start somewhere, with a president and a government that doesn't squander life and everything its nation has.

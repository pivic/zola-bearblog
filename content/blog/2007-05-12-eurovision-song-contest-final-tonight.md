![ESC final](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-05-12-esc.jpg)Yep, it's time for what we Swedes used to refer to as "schlagerfinalen": the [Eurovision Song Contest](http://www.eurovision.tv) final.

A bunch of European countries have held numerous contests to select the single, special song they'll let represent their country, and today they compete against each-other live, in front of half a billion European viewers.

If you're not European, but still would like to check out the action, I recommend either [Eurovisiontorrents.com](http://eurovisiontorrents.com) or [YouTube](http://tinyurl.com/2mrfec).

If you're Swedish, I recommend my mate [Tomas](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/49691212)' blog called [schlagerkung](http://schlagerkung.blogg.se). He's in Helsinki now, happily blogging away at this very moment and knows far more than is healthy to know about all things Eurovision.

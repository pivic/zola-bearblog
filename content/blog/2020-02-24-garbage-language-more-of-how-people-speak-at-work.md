I recently posted [this](https://niklasblog.com/?p=24137) on how people should not speak at work. [tl;dr](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TL%3BDR): don't use vapid statements that contain clichés.

A couple of days ago, Molly Young posted an article named _[Garbage Language: Why do corporations speak the way they do?](https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/spread-of-corporate-speak.html)_ on Vulture.

I love this part of the article:

> I like Anna Wiener’s term for this kind of talk: _garbage language._ It’s more descriptive than _corporatespeak_ or _buzzwords_ or _jargon._ _Corporatespeak_ is dated; _buzzword_ is autological, since it is arguably an example of what it describes; and _jargon_ conflates stupid usages with specialist languages that are actually purposeful, like those of law or science or medicine. Wiener’s _garbage language_ works because garbage is what we produce mindlessly in the course of our days and because it smells horrible and looks ugly and we don’t think about it except when we’re saying that it’s bad, as I am right now.  
>   
> But unlike garbage, which we contain in wastebaskets and landfills, the hideous nature of these words — their facility to warp and impede communication — is also their purpose. Garbage language permeates the ways we think of our jobs and shapes our identities as workers. It is obvious that the point is concealment; it is less obvious what so many of us are trying to hide.

I also loved this part:

**In August, **[WeWork ](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/wework-adam-neumann.html)— recently rebranded as [the We Company](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/10/i-lived-adam-neumanns-perfect-life-for-a-dayit-was-dismal.html) — [submitted its prospectus](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/what-happened-at-we-why-wework-postponed-its-ipo.html) to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The document is just under 200,000 words long, or nearly the length of _Moby-Dick, _and it reads like something a person wrote in the middle of an Adderall overdose with a gun to his head. Here’s how the company [describes](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1533523/000119312519220499/d781982ds1.htm) itself on page one:

We are a community company committed to maximum global impact. Our mission is to elevate the world’s consciousness. We have built a worldwide platform that supports growth, shared experiences and true success.

It's plain to see why some people talk and write the way they do: they simply do not want to be understood.

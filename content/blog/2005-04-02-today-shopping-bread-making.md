Mikaela and I went into town quite early. We went to [Bric-A-Brac](http://www.bric-a-brac.se), where I bought a lovely Freitag bag! Check a picture of it out [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/8209618). There were two contenders, watch them [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/8207316) and [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/8206925). Mikaela looked for new shoes, and found a pair of very nice Campers, but they were white, and as you all know that can (and, most likely, will) get messy. I've coveted the Freitag bags for ages, and now I finally have one. For those of you wondering what the blazes that's all about, Freitag bags are actually something [I've written about earlier](https://niklasblog.com/?p=301), with all sorts of info.

We went on to Pappa Ray Ray, where we had a quite nice chicken soup (with fresh salad and a garlic-feta-cheese sandwich), but once again, the staff forgot to serve coffee I ordered. They never note what customers order in writing, not even during their most stressed times (that I've witnessed, anyway), which I think is a fault. We left without re-ordering coffee despite the "Oh! I'm sorry!"-reaction one of the owners exclaimed when she was reminded of the order. [We went for a coffee](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/8207317), which was good, and had a needed rest.

Anyway, we afterwards ventured on to [Nitty Gritty](http://www.nittygritty.se), where I found a great [Duffer of St. George](http://www.thedufferofstgeorge.com) over-coat (which cost appx. 1000USD). Frederic put on another coat exactly like the one I was wearing: "We should call us 'The Brothers Bespoke'". I leervs that humor. Mikaela found a lovely skirt she really liked. She made it look dazzling.

We went on to åhléns where I finally remembered to get myself a shower gel of my own (as I've been snatching Mikaela's this far, but don't tell her, erhm). We then went to [NK](http://www.nk.se), where Frederic found a very nice Dolce & Gabbana shirt. It was a dark-brownish semi-see-through shirt that was elegantly made. Only thing: it cost appx. 350USD.

We went on to the great Italian ice-cream bar in the galleria right outside NK. They had great ice-cream. Frederic found a belt from [Puma](http://www.puma.com). He's been on the look-out for a nice belt for ages, and now he's found it. A neon-laced leather one, sporting the ubiquitous Puma kitty.

When home, Mikaela unveiled a sour-dough dough she's been letting simmer for an entire week. Today it's proving after a shake, so she's actually thinking of baking it tonight, appx. 01AM, when it's done. That's involvement for you!

[Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-04-02) are pictures from today. Check it out. Soon Frederic will pop up at our place, we'll eat dinner and probably drink a little [Veuve Cliquot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/8206924) before heading out. Lino? We'll see.

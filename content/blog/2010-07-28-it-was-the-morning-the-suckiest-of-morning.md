Got a coffee, came to work, somebody opened a door without looking while I held said coffee and my phone, thus occupying both of my hands.

**Result**: sweater and jeans filled with coffee, I'm reeking of it, I got my hands burned and the door opened right into my face and forehead, so I've got a bleedin' headache while cursing everything around me.

Woe is meeee.

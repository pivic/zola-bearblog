Today, Mikaela went to Farsta Centrum, to have a little look-see at H&M, this special day being the one when [Stella McCartney](http://stellamccartney.com) releases her brand new collection of clothes, exclusively made for H&M.

Mikaela entered the store ten minutes after they'd opened, and the shelves were empty. Mind you, H&M sold a Karl Lagerfelt-collection appx. a year ago, which sold out a couple of hours after it was released, but this time everything went within a few minutes, which is also reported by [SvD](http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_10985069.asp) and [DN](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=678&a=485925&previousRenderType=8).

Reports have been written of panic at the shops, "people behaving like vultures", fist-fights taking place in Stockholm and a lot of over-spending, just because this is extremely hyped. All in the day of a sale.

Back to Mikaela's adventure: she happened to spot a jacket somebody had tried on, before anybody else did. She took a look at it, and was immediately swarmed by people who wanted to know whether she wanted it or not. Yikes! Anyway, she thought it looked nice, so she's one of the select few owners (among a few ten thousand other people) of SM's new wear.

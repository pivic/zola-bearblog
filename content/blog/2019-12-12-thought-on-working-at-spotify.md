Imagine that you love music.

Listening to music, attending concerts, paying your favourite artists for what they do.

Then imagine working at Spotify.

You get a chance to help the artists that you love.

Here's the kicker:

You will make a lot more money per month than the majority of artists make from their Spotify payouts in years.

_Now_ imagine working at Spotify.

Today, artists have to tour tirelessly because they earn very little money from streaming and album sales.

Some artists benefit, but very few.

This is a modern definition of [wage slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery), especially since Spotify is a capitalistic company where the people at the top earn far more money than most people on Earth.

Naturally, the above is not only valid for Spotify, but for all capitalistic companies that parasite off the living.

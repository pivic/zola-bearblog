[The band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...And_You_Will_Know_Us_by_the_Trail_of_Dead) has shed their membership by the time they hit Debaser Slussen yesterday, which was in a state of frenzy ((I.e. filled with Stockholmians who, arms duly folded, nodded in time with the songs.)) as the quartet ripped shit up. Their new bass player could be pulled from Bad Brains, filled with hardcore energy. Still, it's the same ole Trail of Dead that I love. I'd say it was a terrific gig, they played a bunch of new songs and of course a lot of old ones, at times with energy that's hard to match for any other band. Conrad's singing is unique, as is the band as a whole. And yes, I played the bass with them:

As I said, that bass player had energy...

This is not me. As if you didn't know, wahrr!

Did he have energy? Did Conrad influence that tee?

This could be the next best gig of theirs I've been to, with [the one at ATP](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1480) topping the list and [the one at Way Out West](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1325) following far behind. And did we get up on stage? Hell yes we did.

Post show, Jason was a gentleman and it was nice to say hi to him.

Ever since Google released [extensions for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/) - Chrome being their home-made web browser - I've been collating the extensions that have previously forced me to use Firefox. Today, I use Chrome a lot more; it's faster. Every tab in Chrome generates a separate memory process which means that if a site causes a crash, only that tab goes down - not the rest. This is also applicable for extensions, which means troubleshooting them is today a lot easier than in Firefox. On the other hand, [Firefox is heading there too](http://thenextweb.com/appetite/2009/12/16/mozillaruntimeexe-support-multiprocess-plugins-coming/), but not yet. So, what extensions am I using?

But, what do they all do?

**[AdSweep](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fkkedmmdcjakdoeffbpakigjpjgkkfjj)** and **[](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb)[AdThwart](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fkkedmmdcjakdoeffbpakigjpjgkkfjj)** are a must-have in collaboration, against ads of course. Note: [AdBlock](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom) is highly popular.

For using screen-captures that you want to share with the world or just yourself, **[Aviary](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ncgcgghbabbopfcpgcjpfffdgnbadegf)**'s brilliant extension is a must, enabling you not only to capture screens but portions of the screen and then edit the dump online.

**[Brizzly](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fafnphfmggfjfjgoahpnfkpbmgpfcofk)** simplifies how you use your Facebook and/or Twitter feed, pulling data into one big page, displaying it nicely. I like it, even though my use of both services is currently on hiatus.

**[Docs PDF/PowerPoint Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nnbmlagghjjcbdhgmkedmbmedengocbn)** lets you preview those types of files in [Google's Docs Viewer](http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2009/09/view-online-files-using-google-docs.html), which means you don't have to install PDF/PowerPoint-reading software to see contents.

**[Evernote Web Clipper](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc)** enables you to quickly save stuff to Evernote, which is my absolute favourite among note-taking software.

**[Glue](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dpbicidggadonjlbkipkbdlodikododi)** is pretty new to me, a service that lets you collect info on what you like on the web by either displaying an info bar on the bottom part of your screen where you can click a button to give it all a big thumbs-up or a thumbs-down, share your stuff, comment, et.c. I really like the recommendations; even when I've liked quite obscure music, e.g. [EC80R](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dannynorton/186795290/), Glue tips me of [Hanin Elias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanin%20Elias) and [Christoph de Babalon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph%20De%20Babalon), which actually are artists that are similar and that I like. And the list of stuff I have to check out keeps getting longer!

**[Google Calendar Popout](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/emambmpgicpidmncfacjkeicobamadod)** is a clickable button that displays a simple embedded window that shows a monthly calendar on top with your calendar items below, in chronological falling order. Simple and sweet, and even works on Google Apps domains.

**[IE Tab](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hehijbfgiekmjfkfjpbkbammjbdenadd)** is brilliant, and allows you to use some web pages as though you're using Internet Explorer; for example, I use it without any problems on the SharePoint site at work.

**[LastPass](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd)** is a must for me, being my personal password keeper of choice; everything encrypted, nicely packaged. It's a tad ugly, has a few kinks (i.e. it stops working at times, and then I have to disable and enable it to kick back in) but is more than worth any hassle today.

**[RSS Subscription Extension](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd)** adds the [standard RSS-button](http://the16art.com/wp-content/uploads/51-rss-icons.png) in the omnibox (i.e. what many refer to as the address bar) that you click in order to add a feed from the page you're currently browsing to [Google Reader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%20Reader). Note: there's also an extension called [Google reader RSS Subscriber](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/kghdjdlccddmkepckhfgjdeohkcabahl) that allows you to subscribe to the RSS feed in Google Reader by pressing one button.

**[Xmarks Bookmark Sync](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ajpgkpeckebdhofmmjfgcjjiiejpodla)** is overkill for anybody who doesn't want to sync their bookmarks across different browsing platforms (e.g. Firefox/Chrome/Safari/Internet Explorer), as Chrome already contains [built-in functionality for syncing your bookmarks](http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10302091-2.html) throughout other Chrome browsers; just click the wrench icon, click Options, check under the Personal tab and pick Bookmark sync.

**[Zemanta](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fejeknoakjeblidffkajbioncodnmhge)** "looks over your shoulder while you blog and gives you tips and advice, suggests related content and pictures and makes sure your posts get promoted as they deserve to be." It's quite nice, adding value to the semantic web while suggesting pictures and personal stuff for your post.

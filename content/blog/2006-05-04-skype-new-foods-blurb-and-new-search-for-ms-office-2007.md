The interesting people at Skype have come up with [beta-version 2.5](http://skype.com/download/skype/windows/skype25beta.html), which enables a person who's got money to send SMS's through Skype. I've tried it with Mikaela's mobile (works great) and an Amurkan friend's mobile - that SMS still hasn't reached its intended recipient, Skype says.

[This is Stockholm](http://stefsketches.blogspot.com/2006/05/stockholm.html), by the way. Very insightful. Just like building [a tiny computer](http://www.epicempire.com/computers/space-cube.html).

...or [cooking like Grant Achatz](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.05/achatz.html):

> It takes about five hours to make your way through the 25-course Tour menu at Alinea. Item 11 arrives at hour three, stuck on the end of a foot-long wire. Your black-clad, impeccably polite server suddenly turns stern. "This is applewood," he says. "Please eat it without using your hands." The golf ball-sized morsel looms at mouth level; there's not a fork in sight.
> 
> You eye your dining companions nervously. Who's going to be the first to bob for applewood in the middle of a four-star restaurant? You snag yours and it's ... ice cream - cold, of course, but chewy like nougat, and smoky, with some herbal bitterness, somehow both savory and sweet. And absolutely delicious.


Oh, [Blurb](http://www.blurb.com) has opened for business. Make a book, have it published and delivered at your frikkin' doorstep! You can now turn your blog, your flickr image-collection or anything textual into a book in no-time, at 29.95USD for a starting 40 pages. Hm. Speaking of new tech, Microsoft has their AdCenter up and running, which means common people can create a lot of dynamic web-sites which sprout ads. Wee, erhm. Check it out [here](http://news.com.com/2300-1014_3-6067683-1.html?).

A new search engine that can help beta-testers of Office 2007 is here:

> The search engine in Windows Desktop Search (WDS) 3.0 is a Windows service that can be used by applications such as Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 and Office OneNote 2007 to index application content and deliver instant results when searching within an application. This release is an Engine Preview of WDS 3.0 Beta. It contains the WDS 3.0 engine only and is meant to support searching from desktop applications such as Microsoft Office Outlook and OneNote 2007. Since this release does not provide a full desktop search.

Download it from [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/b/e/0be2f3aa-2e43-47f2-b2dc-9aae030bf783/WindowsDesktopSearch-KB917013-x86-en-US.exe), and only if you're using Office 2007.

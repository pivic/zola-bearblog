Having missed [Holy Fuck's 2010 European tour](http://www.flickr.com/photos/punch/sets/72157625369547188/) due to a foreseen USA vacation, I just discovered their video for "_Red Lights_", one of the best tracks off their latest album, "**[Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_(album))**".

This track is already brilliant, but with the video it's great. Kittehs galore!

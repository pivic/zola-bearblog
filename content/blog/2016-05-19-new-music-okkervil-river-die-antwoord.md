First of all, **[Okkervil River](http://okkervilriver.com)** has announced their new album, "_[Away](http://www.atorecords.com/away)_". The first song that is available is "_Okkervil River R.I.P._":

It's beautiful. Don't forget to order that double vinyl, swirly vinyl edition, that includes a digital download. The above track will be made available to you as an MP3 download at once, and the song named "_The Industry_" will be available in July.

The above quote is from [this lovely interview](http://www.npr.org/sections/world-cafe/2016/05/18/478415476/songs-we-love-okkervil-river-okkervil-river-r-i-p) that NPR conducted with Will.

Another band that is releasing music are **[Die Antwoord](http://dieantwoord.com)**.

I still like their album "[Ten$ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(Die_Antwoord_album))" a _lot_, and was utterly disappointed by the follow-up, "[Donker Mag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donker_Mag)". However, things are looking up where it comes to the next song they've dropped, which is "_Gucci Coochie_", a track they did with Dita von Teese, The Black Goat and God:

Admittedly, Dita von Teese on a track is about as enticing as [Kate Moss singing with Primal Scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNNFaJVI42E), but this could mean good things. The track may be incorporated on a mixtape that is set to drop today! Fingers crossed that it does.

The mixtape is out:

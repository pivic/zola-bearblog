Finally! Our new couch has arrived! No more [IKEA's Klippan](http://www.ikea.com/PIAimages/77850_PE200069_S4.JPG) that we previously owned, which is now put to rest.

Blixa even likes it as you can see, and doesn't scratch it much. When she does, or tries to, X and I try to squash her tantrum in its infancy, to let her understand that the couch isn't another cat-toy. I feel like it's going to work.

The transport company left a bit to desire, though. First of all, their name is [BEST Transport](http://www.besttransport.se), which is a laugh and a half. They called me a few days after purchase to book a date and time-interval during which they'd deliver the couch. On the morning of said date they called to tell me "the car was sick" so they couldn't deliver. No apology. Instead, a new date and time-interval was decided. The date came, and the time, too. I called them up to hear what was going on, and a guy assured me they'd meet the said time. About 30 before their time was up, a guy called me to say there was a lot of traffic and they'd be 30-40 minutes late. 45 minutes later, the same guy called me to ask for the code to enter our house (which I'd previously given their company) and knocked on our door 20 minutes later. Way to go.

Funnily enough, the sales-person at EM, where we bought the couch, said the transport guys would deliver it and put it together. No such thing. They rushed the couch - or rather, the parts of it, said we'd easily put it together with a little IKEA-wrench and just sign here and no more, adios. Not a thank you, even. No apology.

Kudos goes out to my dad for giving me just the type of wrench that was needed to put the couch together. X and I had made plans for the evening and wouldn't have been able to leave the house if the couch would have been in pieces. Luckily, Blixa likes the couch and we put it together quickly.

So nowadays, we stretch out in the sofa eeeeeasily. The old one's a distant memory; thank you for serving us well for that time, but this new one's just another dimension of comfort altogether. Yee-haaaaw!

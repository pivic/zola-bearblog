Last Saturday, X and I saw [a photo-exhibition called "SKINS", by Gavin Watson](http://fargfabriken.se/index.php?tabell=content&id=180), at Färgfabriken.

As we ““ somehow ““ finally felt fit enough to go anywhere, we decided to see the photos that inspired the film _[This Is England](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480025)_, a film we both love. [Shane Meadows](http://www.myspace.com/shanemeadows), the director, has said that one of Watson's photos that shows a young skinhead in a crombie standing next to a older lad made out the ideal for Shane and Woody, two of the main characters in the film.

Saturday was a really cold day, and neither X or I were really prepared for the weather. Gloves and scarves weren't in-place, but we soldiered on and quickly found ourselves in Liljeholmen, where we had a [sandwich and dirty coffee at Café Bravo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/1950225752), which really was a dump. We then headed out into the cold again, and followed a mob of people who seemed like they knew where they were heading; we hit Färgfabriken, where the exhibition lay. The entrance was filled with people eager to watch pics of England forlorn, and we picked up a couple of free photographs, taken by Watson. We've since framed one, and it's standing nicely on our computer desk; it's [the cover of Watson's book](http://img216.imageshack.us/my.php?image=skinsdb3.jpg), "[Skins](http://www.amazon.com/Skins-Gavin-Watson/dp/1587540169)", and shows two suedehead boys, both sitting on a ledge with a semi-terraced landscape stretching out in the background. To the right, an older boy. To the left, a younger, flipping the V-sign, grimacing, face profile.

We entered the part of Färgfabriken where the pictures were displayed. A semi-large, rectangular room was filled with big prints, smaller ones and some LCD-screens hung like frames. Skinheads, suedeheads and basically everybody adhering to the culture that made up the sane skinhead credo were pictured. X and I fell in love with a massive picture of a skinny, young girl with wavy hair, punky clothes and make-up, who was seemingly looking at a poster of Marilyn Monroe's face. The poster was pinned in a room with weird wall-paper.

We gathered with the rest of the people who had come to hear Watson speak about his growing up, about how he was a very sensitive, young boy who had just moved with his family into unchartered territory where school seemed like a complete nightmare, until he fought back and beat the shit out of his tormentors, and then ended up falling in love with the skinhead side of life. In other interviews found on the web, he says he chose between a pair of binoculars and a camera, and chose the latter. With it, he began mapping the territory which made out the life of his own and his friends. He snapped thousands of pictures, and found people growing increasingly interested in them, as they portrayed a culture that quite few have seen from the inside, a culture condemned by many people on the outside as being anti-everything; au contraire, the original skinheads had nothing to do with racism, nazism and/or the [National Front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_National_Front), but listened to music brought by immigrants from the Caribbean and mixed with each-other without sexism, racism or nationalism in mind.

[Here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-11-14-gavinwatson.mp3)'s most of the 15-minute talk by Watson, as recorded by yours truly using a pappy mobile phone at the event. That's a downloadable MP3, by the way.

After the talk, he only received one question, but I managed to snag him afterwards, and he talked some about the photo with the girl and Marilyn. He explained that she was his girlfriend at the time, and that they were at a tattooist's place; amateur or pro, I've no idea. Anyway, she was watching the different motifs as he just snapped a picture of her, at the time completely oblivious to what the picture suddenly seemed to display.

The exhibition was really nice. Watson was sweet and had a lot of interesting things to say. I imagine a talk with him about the Thatcherite days of England would learn me more than most of my time at upper secondary school did. Could be because I didn't care much for history at that time, mind you...

[Here](http://www.viceland.com/int/v14n2/htdocs/pictures.php?country=uk) you'll find a few nice, previously unpublished photographs by Gavin Watson. The boggling picture with the boy and the owl was for sale at mentioned exhibition we went to. [Here](http://vice.typepad.com/vice_magazine/2007/04/post.html#more)'s a three-page spread on Watson's pictures from _The Observer_. [Here](http://www.viceland.com/int/v14n7/htdocs/gavin.php?country=uk) you'll find three very revealing shots of Watson's girlfriends from back in the day.

Here's a video of Gavin Watson where he discusses his photography and prejudice against non-hating skinheads, together with one of his old skinhead friends:

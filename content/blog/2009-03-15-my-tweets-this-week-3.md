- Listening to The Penetrators' "Scandalizer" on repeat. Damn, it's mad and bad! Phrasing isn't a gift, it's a curse; the singers rule. [#](http://twitter.com/pivic/statuses/1310642387)
- [http://twitpic.com/1ztxf](http://twitpic.com/1ztxf) - Being held awake through night by this loveable, unfurry, demonic, sweet, screaming and cuddly cat. [#](http://twitter.com/pivic/statuses/1309157171)

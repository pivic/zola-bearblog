> The world's 62 richest billionaires have as much wealth as the bottom half of the world's population, according to a new report from Oxfam International.
> 
> The wealthiest have seen their net worth soar over the five years ending in 2015. Back in 2010, it took 388 mega-rich people to own as much as half the world.

This is so fucked-up. Read up [here](http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/17/news/economy/oxfam-wealth/index.html).

Anybody still in doubt whether capitalism is the destruction of every living thing on the planet?

> The income gap between the richest and poorest is also growing. The poorest 20% of the world -- who live below the extreme poverty line, living on less than $1.90 a day -- barely saw their incomes budge between 1988 and 2011, while the most prosperous 10% enjoyed a 46% jump.

> "The global economy is not working to pull these people out of extreme poverty," said Deborah Hardoon, Oxfam's deputy head of research.

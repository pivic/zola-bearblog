The above video shows the results of my friend [Mr. Anos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/278578831) IM'ing me during the late Friday afternoon, asking me to scrunch a piece of paper and throw it at [Kalle](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/107357821), one of my esteemed colleagues and friends. I did so.

Their funny fighting has been going on for years, and even though [Anos has made fun of Kalle in the past](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/7290587) and Kalle's often threatened to retaliate - nothing has happened! Why? When will their onslaught really begin? I'm waiting in the shadows for the day, ready to capture it all.

Oh, my. I'm a chickenhawk sending my friends into battle with each-other. In a fun way, of course.

P.s. Do note [Anos' comment at the end of the video-page](http://vimeo.com/636081) at Vimeo. _Fight on!_

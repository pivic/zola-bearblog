Nature [is still beautiful. Some Swedish people are still idiots, like Urban Persson](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/varmland/storforspolitiker-akte-till-stockholm-for-att-fa-corona), who has tried to infect himself with COVID-19 on purpose, 'as a fun thing'.

Weather's lovely now. Life is growing. I'm avoiding people. It's weird because I'm usually such a social animal.

Somehow, since COVID-19 exploded, I've read less. Or, rather, my reading has slowed down massively.

I'm taking my time with Kate Kirkpatrick's _[Becoming Beauvoir](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/24/becoming-beabuvoir-by-kate-kirkpatrick)_, a one-third-in brilliant book about Simone de Beauvoir. It's revelatory and seemingly very well researched. It reminds me of Deirdre Bair and Sarah Bakewell. God, I hope Sarah will release a new book soon.

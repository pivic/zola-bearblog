From lunch today: I was sitting by myself reading a book, waiting for a colleague to join me. Another colleague walks by me, stops, sees me reading and starts talking.

**He**: is that a Kindle?

**I**: yes, it is.

He picks it up, checks it out.

**He**: nice.

**I**: yeah, I really dig them. Are you thinking about getting one?

**He**: no, I'm not into that.

He then walks off. I'm reading the start of a very everyday, shocking autobiography, Â but as I realise that he meant that _he's not into reading_, that fucking shocked me.

Swedish men and reading, not two things that often go together.

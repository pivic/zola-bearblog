[![Masters of Sexism](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/jon_copy.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/jon_copy.jpg)

A few days ago, pictures from iCloud accounts belonging to celebrities, notably Jennifer Lawrence's account, were [hacked and spread online](http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-statement-on-icloud-hack-2014-9). While some persons acted like idiots, trying to blame the celebrities for saving their pictures to the Internet, others reacted wisely:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="sv"><p>Even worse than seeing women's privacy violated on social media is reading the accompanying comments that show such a lack of empathy.</p>— Emma Watson (@EmWatson) <a href="https://twitter.com/EmWatson/status/506531006380527617">1 september 2014</a></blockquote>

Also, this is hasn't to do with the hack at all, but is a marvellous feat by one woman; the text below the video explains all:

From [this article in the New York Post](http://nypost.com/2014/09/02/ivy-student-carries-mattress-after-alleged-rapist-isnt-expelled/):

> A Columbia University student is carrying her dorm room mattress everywhere she walks on campus to protest the fact that her alleged rapist has not been expelled. Emma Sulkowicz, 21, is using the performance art project as a way to shame the Ivy League school, she told the Columbia Spectator.
> 
> “I was raped in my own dorm bed, and since then that space has become fraught for me,” she says in a video.
> 
> “I feel like I’ve carried the weight of what happened there with me everywhere since then.”
> 
> The senior is one of 23 students that filed a federal complaint against the school for failing to protect them.

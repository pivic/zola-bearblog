Well, I'm a sucker for Morrissey as you might know, and as such I know that he yesterday visited Kirsty Young at the jolly BBC's "Desert Island Discs" to play outtakes from what eight discs he would bring to a desert island. No real surprises there, but a mix of varied tracks with a strong foot in the 1970s, notable exception being [Robert Schumann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schumann "Robert Schumann")'s "Der Nussbaum" from 1840.

I've created [this almost-complete Spotify playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/pivic/playlist/2VU9jjS7Qh7txOKmPceIWr) from the tracks that Morrissey chose.

If you want to listen to the podcast in its entirety - bar complete musical selections due to copyright reasons - you will at the time of my writing this find it [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/did).

Here's the song list:

1\. **New York Dolls** - "(There's Gonna Be Be A) Showdown" 2. **[Marianne Faithfull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Faithfull "Marianne Faithfull")** -"Come And Stay With Me" 3. **Ramones** - "Loudmouth" 4. **Velvet Underground** - "[The Black Angel's Death Song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Angel%27s_Death_Song "The Black Angel's Death Song")" 5. **[Klaus Nomi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Nomi "Klaus Nomi")** - "Der Nussbaum" 6. **Nico** - "[I'm Not Sayin'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Not_Sayin%27)" 7. **Iggy and The Stooges** - "Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell" 8. **Mott The Hoople** - "Sea Diver"

Annotations by yours truly:

First, there's currently nothing recorded by Klaus Nomi available on Spotify, which is why I've selected a recital of "_Der Nussbaum_" as performed by [Victoria de Los àngeles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_de_los_%C3%81ngeles), late world-renowned soprano. Here's Klaus Nomi's version:

Nico's cover of [Gordon Lightfoot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Lightfoot "Gordon Lightfoot")'s "I'm Not Sayin'" is pretty interesting. Sadly her version is not available on Spotify, but Lightfoot's original is, so I've incorporated that instead. Here's Nico's version:

Actually, that's [Jimmy Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Page "Jimmy Page") on 12-stringed guitar in there, working as session musician back in the day.

It's so nice to hear Ramones included with "Loudmouth". Such a great diss track.

> Well, you're a loudmouth baby/You better shut it up/I'm gonna beat you up/You're a loudmouth, baby

Mott The Hoople ends it all with a track very reminiscent of all things [Marc Bolan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Bolan "Marc Bolan"), hailing from the same age. It's quite unexpected to me, despite being very T. Rex/Bowie. When the strings start in the tears flow. Drama.

Apart from the discs, Morrissey had to choose a book, which turned out to be "The Complete Works of Oscar Wilde". As luxury item, he chose a bed after having dwelled on to pick that or sleeping pills.

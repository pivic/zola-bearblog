Voxtrot are busy compiling material for their coming album. Ramesh blogs about it [here](http://thevoxtrotkid.blogspot.com/2009/04/youth-trip.html), and it's the first real sign of their existence following their abridged tour where [they ditched us](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1322) to go warm up for Arctic Monkeys on the latter's tour of America. No date for release of the album is set, not even a year.

Here's "_Trepanation Party_", a new track that's out through [their official site](http://voxtrot.net).

I don't really know what to make of it. It reminds me of U2 circa "_[Seconds](http://hypem.com/track/785303/U2+-+Seconds)_", but "_[Raised By Wolves](http://hypem.com/track/778684/Voxtrot+-+Raised+by+Wolves)_" it sure as hell ain't! I'm not saying Voxtrot should stay in their ways, but I'm not sure this is a good move. We'll just have to see. The synths remind me of The Cure, but _not_ in a good way.

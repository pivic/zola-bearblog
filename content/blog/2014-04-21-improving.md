You know when you're alone without her?

I'm doing my thing. She's doing hers in another physical place. That's it. Thoughts swirl around a lot of things.

I've thought deep into a lot of stuff. Realising what has passed. Realising potential: speaking nothing; Doing Is All. Words are really powerless, as they should be. But they can be All sometimes.

I cleaned house a little this evening. Dusted. Used a rag. Liquids. Stowed stuff away. Cleaned up. Cleaned out. No stomach aching. No mind-bending exercises. Breathed in air. Almost like doing yoga.

There are no boundaries but those that I put in place.

You know what comes after you suddenly discover that she's done something simple, just a little improvement at home that's just sensible, yet leaves another indelible trace of her? I don't want to be without that, _a little G_, her simple things, her fingertips having perhaps reached quickly for and placed that burned-out stick of incense to let it hold up a new stick that would otherwise wobble low, a near-thoughtless exercise designed to make something better?

It could be a silly little twirl in your belly. It could be a twitch, or discovering that you've spent time smiling without knowing it, or smelling her pillow to remember because of it. It could be a non-fading supernova forming somewhere without your knowing where. You just want to be in it, that's all you care about. And to love her with every cell of you. You want to have a clearer picture of her without diluting anything. You want her to be right in front of you this slowly dying second, as each breath forms, is exhaled and rebirths without her being in front of you. A breath becomes a sigh.

Some say it's the little things. I'll say it's the little things. It's the things. It's the everythings. I don't give a toss if somebody _aw fucks_ this but it's what matters most to me. ((A real short drive.))

I hear Alex Kapranos yell "you're so lucky" and it's true.

The _I'm yours_ from yesterday morning echoes throughout our home.

And I listen to jj's "_Kill You_" and I feel X's presence. And I could find myself doing gun poses with my hands and I suddenly find myself smiling.

Until I publish a proper review, here's an video that I shot from the gig. The songs mashed up are, in chronological order, "_The President's Dead_", \[the outro of\] "_Black_" \[segueing into\], "_A Hand To Take Hold Of The Scene_", "_A Girl In Port_", "_So Come Back, I Am Waiting_". That's about when the battery in my mobile phone died.

The guys were wonderful. You're true gentlemen, on-stage as well as off!

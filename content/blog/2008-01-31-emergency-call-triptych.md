Three itty bitties. Here you go.

**Why?**

I pick up the phone and say my courtesy, and a user on the other end says the following:

"I have a bunch of Excel files that I've put in a write-protected folder. Now, when I open one of them, Excel says 'The file is write-protected'. Why is this?"

Oy vey. Easy tackle, though. On to the next call.

**"I promise. I PROMISE!"**

I pick up the phone and say my courtesy, and the following happens; but let me first clarify that the words in italics really mean that those words were particularly enunciated:

User: Hello! I'm experiencing problems when I paste a PowerPoint-image in Word. When I do that, _everything_ gets pasted in there. I: Hm, exactly what do you mean by _everything_? U: Everything. I: Let me rephrase my question: exactly what other than the image is pasted? U: Just everything. I: Let me remote control your computer, to see what the problem might be. U: Sure!

I connect to the user's computer and let the user show me the exact actions taken; the user enters PowerPoint, clicks a picture to mark it, copies it, starts Word and pastes. The picture is pasted, nothing else is, as expected.

U: I can't believe it! _Everything_ wasn't pasted! I: Very good! U: So, why was _everything_ not pasted this time? I: Hm, good question; you might have copied and pasted the _slide_ instead of the picture, which would explain everything. U: Oh! Could you please show me, so that I can avoid doing that mistake again? I: Sure thing.

I show the user how to copy a slide and what it looks like when the slide is pasted into Word.

U: I see... \[raises volume and pitch considerably\] But, I haven't done that! I haven't! I: It's OK, just-- U: I promise you, I didn't do that! I _promise_!

I suddenly feel like a parent who's telling my child everything is OK - _we won't disown you for what you might have done_.

I: It's OK, I know. U: Thanks, I was afraid you wouldn't believe me. I: I do, I do. U: OK, thanks. Bye! I: Good-bye!

**Can't**

I pick up the phone and say my courtesy, and a user - quite possibly [Christian Siriano](http://www.christianvsiriano.com/bio.html) - kicks off by saying this:

"Hello! I can't e-mail anybody despite having an e-mail open, and I've clicked the frikkin' send-button a million times, and nothing happens, so what I've done, is I've added a recipient for every time I've clicked send to see if something would happen then, but it doesn't, so now I've spent _at least_ 20 minutes adding people and clicking send in-between, and I'll do it just one more time, and..._oh my God_! Hang on...the e-mail is sent! It's sent! I've sent it to everybody in my address book! Oh my God! How do I cancel that e-mail? It's being sent! It's being sent! Oh my God! Help me, please, please help me, oh my God!"

Where stress comes in, logic goes away (if it was ever in-place to begin with); something doesn't work the first time you do it, so you do it again and again? For 20 minutes?! Blazes. I can understand the problem, but this only seems to happen in an IT environment. You don't see many people who want to post a letter, trying to shove their hand through a closed mail-box over and over again, because it didn't work the first time around.

To end this last call on a bright note, the user was actually able to "cancel" the mass e-mailing - simply because the e-mail _wasn't_ sent at all. The user merely believed it was. Ta-raah!

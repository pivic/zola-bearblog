From "_[The Paris Review Interviews, vol. 2](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2101665.The_Paris_Review_Interviews)_", page 53:

> INTERVIEWER
> 
> What is the function of the critic?
> 
> FAULKNER
> 
> The artist doesn't have time to listen to the critics. The ones who want to be writers read the reviews, the ones who want to write don't have the time to read reviews. The critic too is trying to say, "Kilroy was here." His function is not directed toward the artist himself. The artist is a cut above the critic, for the artist is writing something that will move the critic. The critic is writing something that will move everybody but the artist.

> INTERVIEWER
> 
> So you never feel the need to discuss your work with anyone?
> 
> FAULKNER
> 
> No, I am too busy writing it. It has got to please me and if it does I don't need to talk about it. If it doesn't please me, talking about it won't improve it, since the only thing to improve it is to work on it some more. I am not a literary man but only a writer, I don't get any pleasure from talking shop.

Apparently, Faulkner appeared to have a rather big stick up his behind and saw himself as better than others...

> INTERVIEWER
> 
> Some people say they can't understand your writing, even after they have read it two or three times. What approach would you suggest for them?
> 
> FAULKNER
> 
> Read it four times.

...but apart from that, I think he's right in the sense that you have to find your own way and try not to care too much what others think of your writing. And to end it all:

> INTERVIEWER
> 
> How does a writer become a serious novelist?
> 
> FAULKNER
> 
> Ninety-nine percent talent...ninety-nine percent discipline...ninety-nine percent work. He must never be satisfied with what he does. It never is as good as it can be done. Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Don't bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself. An artist is a creature driven by demons. He doesn't know why they choose him and he's usually too busy to wonder why. He is completely amoral in that he will rob, borrow, beg, or steal from anybody and everybody to get the work done.

I'm not totally sure I agree, but "try to be better than yourself" seems like a good point.

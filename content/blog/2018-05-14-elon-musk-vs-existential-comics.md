I follow a philosophy-based humor account named "**Existential Comics**" on Facebook and Twitter, and it's always been insightful and funny to read. This time it chimed in with Elon Musk, who decided to start discussing things. First, here's a synopsis of what happened from Existential Comics, after which you'll find screenshots from the conversation as found on Twitter:

> So Elon Musk got mad at me yesterday on twitter for saying he was the villain from Atlas Shrugged, argued that he succeeded \*in spite\* of billions in public funding, then calling me a chimp and blocked me lol. BTW, SpaceX launched a government funded rocket \*during\* these tweets.
> 
> The Internet is amazing.

The synopsis as quoted before the screenshots say it all.

Elon Musk is like the banks: they live because the people's money is what makes them. Talk about your shortcut to austerity...

I can't say how happy I am to see a major capitalist get beat up on his own turf by somebody with Simone de Beauvoir acting their avatar.

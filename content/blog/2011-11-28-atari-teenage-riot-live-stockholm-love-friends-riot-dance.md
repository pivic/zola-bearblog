That was _fun_!

> THANK U STOCKHOLM! â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜ â˜ â˜ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ Atari ST caused soundsystem crash, then the bassspeakers died. Atari Teenage Riot & crowd unstoppable â–ˆâœŒâ¤

First of all, X and I went with Ida to Debaser Slussen where we had drinks, and were later joined by [Marielle](http://jungeljerta.blogspot.com) and we all gathered right next to Debaser's bar area... It was grand to sit around and talk. In the meantime I peered into the crowd and while it felt weird to see people sporting ATR-related t-shirts ((I mean, I've seldom come across anybody who's actually liked [Atari Teenage Riot](http://www.atari-teenage-riot.com), so...)) I couldn't help but feel how the most "alternative" person there would be somebody dressed in white!

So, the concert started and I think I was the only one in our gang who'd listened to the band and we all didn't give a fuck about that, and we all danced. We actually danced in a little rectangular crypt area next to the bar area, where we went apeshit. I mean, ATR are the stuff that I imagine the cast of "Jersey Shore" listens to but with anarchic theory, riots and punk rock thrown in, the tempo doubled, so we were the equivalent of bouncing Swedos (Swedish guidos?!) who were eyed eerily by security as they passed from time to time.

X and Marielle even choreographed and showcased their own dance, how cool was that? We were joined by Björn who was fun and later got very drunk; we all champagned and screamed REVOLUTION ACTION! at the top of our lungs. Marielle had a tall, weird, quiet and bizarre goth guy coming on to her which was funny-scary. I almost died when ATR played the song they did with Slayer, "_No Remorse (I Wanna Die)_":

To answer your question: yes, the venue did warn for strobe-effects. The more strobe = the more fun you have? **Damn** straight!

At the start of the concert ATR played their newer songs but then went into old mode which I felt had more riot to it, more youthful oomph instead of their new, much thought-over and processed stuff. All in all: **_DIIIIIIIIIIIE_**!!!!11

Aaron later popped up which was really nice! Hadn't seen him since our belated New Year's celebrations and this time we had a dancing good time as well. The DJ played so much **SebastiAn** I nearly died. I gave the DJ kudos and thanks which I went to his head as he started twiddling knobs a bit too much. Well, I was fairly much in dancing mode anyway so anything went.

Left the place feeling like a better person having been surrounded by friends and love. And rioting. Great.

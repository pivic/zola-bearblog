[![Ego Girl](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1300364151m/10806023.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10806023-ego-girl)[Ego Girl](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10806023-ego-girl) by [Carolina Gynning](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4722106.Carolina_Gynning)  
My rating: [2 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/154919981)  
  
The best fact: it's written as though the author has some grave ADHD issues.  
  
The worst fact: it's written as though the author has some grave ADHD issues.  
  
Carolina Gynning writes of her growing pains, her becoming a model with international partying, her partaking in the Swedish version of TV-show "Big Brother" and her desire to be taken seriously as an artist.  
  
Throughout the book she litters her words of wisdom. She wants to be taken seriously and writes of her snogging Calum Best. She writes of feminism in a great way, then writes about her flaws, her ups and what she likes in life. She rants about being beaten up, about winning "Big Brother", of her men. Of her family.  
  
It's all very wishy-washy, as though Gynning really needed an editor. She had a contributor, but I don't know what that person really did for this book. It's scattered, leaving a quite manic impression.  
  
In its defense, it is entertaining. Gynning's many adventures as a young model are quite funny at times. All in all, reading this book is like watching an episode of "Sex and The City": they may aspire to be something more than entertaining, but quite rarely is - still, there is an oomph behind the surface that lingers. In Gynning's case, this is her unconscious fight for feminism.

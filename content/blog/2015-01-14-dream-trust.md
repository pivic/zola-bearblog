Last night I dreamt something.

I met with a doctor. He had round, thick goggles and did not smile. His graying hair was whisked behind his ears like a mask would be tied behind the head, and he seemed much older than his face would tell.

He asked me if I trusted my wife, and implicitly, to what extent.

"I trust her completely," I said.

"So you say. But how much?" he replied cryptically.

"What do you mean?"

"If you trust your wife, you should be to show just how much," he said, emanating a smirk without any facial movement. I usually don't dream sophistically, they often aren't more than a feeling. "You should be able to prove it," he added.

"Naturally," I said. "But how do you mean? Do you have anything in mind?"

"If I find out that you trust her completely, you will see one year into your future. However, if your trust is not omniscient, you will be mine." This was said slowly and factually, as though there would be no mistakes made.

I then saw Hell. From above, almost through the pan of a movie camera, Hell was real and I was in it. I instantly knew where I was, inside a cage, small enough to keep me from standing straight or from breathing properly. Heat isn't a word to properly describe the air, which was smoke-filled, yellow and red. There were other, cramped beings of many kinds everywhere around me. I knew that this is where I would spend Eternity if...

"I accept it," I said. "Go ahead. Find out what I know."

The man lowered his head a bit and I could immediately feel his stare literally penetrate my mind, as though everything I have ever experienced, felt, fantasised, dreamed or knew was being examined as though he were leafing through a book.

I lost track of time. But my resolute trust was the same as before he asked me.

"Here you go," he said, leaving an air of defeat but more so an air of keeping his word.

I immediately knew what I was now seeing was 10 years into the future, not one.

I lived next to water, a few levels up in an apartment which was big. I don't know where I lived. There was a big balcony, an island in my kitchen where I could cook food. And artefacts on the walls, stuff that I own in real life. X was there.

She was obviously older and beautiful. Her presence was everywhere, as was mine; the beauty of two individuals blended in Love.

She was now a manager at work, responsible for some kind of branch of state that produced criminological research, papers and training. She had piles of work at home. I was wearing a shirt with the arms rolled up. It was a summer evening, and a door to the balcony was open. Something fresh was in the air.

I interrupted her work and told her that no, leave that stuff, come dance with me. And she did, to the sound of some silly song, I twirled her and she laughed and we both laughed and we were as we were when we first met, but in another time.

Truth always wins.

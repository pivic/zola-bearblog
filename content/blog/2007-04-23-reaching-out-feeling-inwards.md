Time ticks and I'm getting on with life. It's not as if it's stopped since the 11th of April. Everything has happened since and keeps on happening. At times matters are calm, other times they shock, jolt and panic me.

I'm continuing to update my diary and am keeping in touch with friends and family. I'm planning my economy, my future, my life. At times I feel like I'm failing, but I know I won't.

There is so much to do, inwards and outwards.

My esteemed colleague **Uno** came by straight outta Japan yesterday and gave me the above. That fucking wooden cat takes ages to muddle together and I really like it. It's more of a puzzle than a creature. Uno said it was probably more of a punishment than a gift.

And he gave me some lovely kitty papers, too.

Speaking of nothing, don't miss [this interview](http://ng.se/artiklar/henrik-berggren-nu-har-jag-tratt-in-i-legendstatusen) (in Swedish) with **Henrik Berggren**. For those of you who don't know who he is, hear his band Broder Daniel. Berggren's debut solo album is out in May. This year! That debut album is almost as mythical as My Bloody Valentine's "_MBV_".

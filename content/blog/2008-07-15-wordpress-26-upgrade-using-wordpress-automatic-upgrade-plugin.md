Hey y'all! I'm just back from Serbia, and just as much as I know you're sitting on the edge of your seats in wait of a post on that ((If you're really on the bleeding edge, I've just edited, rendered and uploaded [this video](http://vimeo.com/1343327) to Vimeo, where you can see an entire 20 minutes of my Belgrade experience.)), here's something else; WordPress 2.6 has just been released, which entails a slew of nice upgrades, e.g. post revisions, [new cookie and SSL handling](http://boren.nu/archives/2008/07/14/ssl-and-cookies-in-wordpress-26), bookmarklet support, Google Gears in the admin interface (yes!) and more, all covered in text [here](http://wordpress.org/development/2008/07/wordpress-26-tyner).

As I run my own WordPress installation, I go through the manual process - that is, until I discovered [Wordpress Automatic Update plugin](http://techie-buzz.com/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-automatic-upgrade-plugin.html), which automates the process considerably for you. It allows you to upgrade your current installation completely automatically or step-by-step, if you'd like. I've just posted [this little comment](http://techie-buzz.com/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-automatic-upgrade-plugin.html#comment-27138) on how to upgrade your 2.5.x-installation to 2.6, and there's really nothing to it, provided you've read the how-to and all that.

**edit**: the plugin is now updated to function fully on 2.6.

Here's an official WordPress video showing you what's new in 2.6:

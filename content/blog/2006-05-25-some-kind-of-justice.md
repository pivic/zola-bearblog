![Beyatches](http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41689000/jpg/_41689194_composite203body.jpg)I have no love for the bosses of Enron, so now when the biggest ones are getting [sentenced to jail for what will most likely be the rest of their lives](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5017298.stm), I am happy.

They devastated the lives of many and ended up on top anyway, but really, taking their freedom will be devastation for them, even if they're rich.

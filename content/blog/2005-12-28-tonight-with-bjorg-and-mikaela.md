Tonight, Björg, Mikaela's best friend, being a wonderful person and Mikael Persbrandt's lover, dropped by. She's going through a painful process of separating from her husband, and it was very nice for Mikaela and myself to meet her. We had a great time (actually not relating to the contents of the picture above), and it's always great to meet somebody who has wit and humour apart from loving Ulf Lundell and his friends.

Knowing Mikaela and Björg well enough, I knew we were in for a night of caring, intelligent and also fun conversation; as I wrote, the evening entailed a bit of talk on hardships and relationships, past times and coming ones, love and war, dilemma and clarity, and the further we spoke, the more of the latter we met - yeah, clarity. And fun. And champagne. And wine.

The older I get, the more relationships mean to me; in love, as in friendship, of course. With Mikaela, I'm innerly glad and grateful to say I feel both in the strongest possible sense.

My tip of the day: Morrissey's "[Hold On To Your Friends](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/morrissey/96110.html)".

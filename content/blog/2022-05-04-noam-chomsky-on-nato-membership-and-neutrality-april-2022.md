On 2022-04-28, as part of their 'Global conversations' series, University College Stockholm and Sankt Ignatios College organised a discussion on the topic 'Sweden in NATO? The Future of East-West Relations after the War in Ukraine.' The guest speaker was Noam Chomsky. The conversation was led by Davor Džalto, professor in the Department of Eastern Christian Studies at UCS.

A piece of transcript from the video talk:

**Davor Džalto**: In the article I referred to before, \[...\] mentioned \[a\] survey from 2019 done in 14 European countries which clearly suggested that in the event of war between the US, Russia, and/or China, a vast majority of Europeans would prefer to be neutral, which seems to be quite a reasonable position but doesn't seem to be reflected in public policies.  
  
**Noam Chomsky**: Actually, it's not a reasonable position. It's based on a misunderstanding of war; a deep misunderstanding.  
  
If there's a war between the US and Russia, or the US and China, we are all dead, okay? Period. There's no neutrality.

Naturally, the transcript is slightly pulled out of context, but it's all there. There is no alternative.

It's naturally also worth to consider the fact that the annihilation of humankind is one of the two biggest threats right now, the other being the climate catastrophy; [we have a handful of months to radically change our ways](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/ipcc-report-now-or-never-if-world-stave-off-climate-disaster) - really meaning the ways of the major corporations that mainly stand behind the destruction of most life on Earth - or perish. This fact really is just that harsh and simple.

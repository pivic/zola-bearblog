Alright, [X's post on the subject](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2008/07/31/pre-way-out-west-again) inspired me to check out [the official Way Out West homepage](http://wayoutwest.se) to see if the schedule was in place, and goodness me, it's there. I've uploaded it to Scribd, so watch it here in its fanciful beauty:

**Slottsskogen**

Reflections on this schedule:

**1**. Okkervil River crashes with Franz Ferdinand! They're playing during almost the same time-slot! Disaster! Somehow I'll manage, but...fawkinell. No worries. I'll soak my misery in the knowledge that I'll probably be happy and merry with OR while Franz play in another place. Otherwise, no real issues during day 1.

**2**. José Gonzà¡les opens day 2. Great. Then I can sleep through that ordeal and not having to worry one little bit.

**3**. Seems like the logical step from Silverbullit is to Lil' Kim! Woo! That's the equivalent of going from Joy Division to The Go! Team. Almost.

**4**. Booka Shade are playing a stage rather than a club. If I see them, it'll be interesting. I hope my bad feeling about that will be kicked to pieces because I currently am guessing they'd be better off performing in a secluded club.

**The clubs**

Reflections on this schedule:

**1**. Buzzcocks are the only band I really want to see during this day, so far; the schedules are far from completed, and I can't see where Girl Talk is set to play.

**update**: Girl Talk has cancelled his gig. _Come back!_

**2**. Holy Fuck are playing day 2 at 01:25, i.e. in the night. Sweet. It would probably mean they're sort of ending the entire festival. I'd love to see them. I'm guessing one has to queue all night for that one. No sweat.

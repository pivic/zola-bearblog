![Muxtape vs RIAA](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-08-19-muxtape.jpg)

So, what's up, doc? The day came. It seems the RIAA has no love for [Muxtape](http://muxtape.com). Or at least, they're investigating the matter. According to [this post](http://muxtape.tumblr.com/post/46472068) by Muxtape they're not being shut down indefinitely, but are probably under investigation.

This means that [my Muxtape](http://pivic.muxtape.com) is currently defunct. Blaah.

Last night my work-mates and I held a surprise party for our boss, who recently turned 50. [Here are a few pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-11-12), taken using a Qtek 9090, which doesn't produce as good pictures as my former Nokia phone did. Isn't technology supposed to move forward? I think it does with [this film](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-12-IT.wmv) \[WMV 10, 2.2MB) that's made using Microsoft's [Photo Story 3](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/photostory/default.mspx).

It was pretty calm, even though people sang along to a lot of tracks by Nationalteatern, an old Swedish prog band. I must add that I hate their "Hanna Från Arlöv", a really crappy song. The message is good, but the lyrics and first of all, the melody, sucks intensely. Karin also wanted to hear Mike Oldfield's "Tubular Bells", but we didn't let that play in its entirety.

People wanted karaoke, and so we had that too, but without a microphone, so everybody sang on all the tracks. 80's and 90's Swedish pop music was dominating and hence, most of what was played was crap. I loved to see my boss smiling with her older child, who's 16 years old and totally into Bowie. I'll give her a little Van Der Graaf Generator and Lou Reed's "Transformer" and we'll see what happens. I hope the logical step will be Iggy Pop, Velvet Underground and then maybe Pixies, Atari Teenage Riot, Merzbow...or maybe not.

Tonight it's off to Patrik & Staffan for food and drinks!

_"This is a calm song. No, **IT'S NOT**!"_

If "grown-ups" would be more in-tune with their emotions, not filter what they think as much and have an open mind like these kids, I think society would, on the whole, be a much lovelier place to live in.

The reactions! The lyric reactions, the way the kids interpret Nirvana as a whole after one, three and five songs - it's really inspiring to me!

And fun. And funny. The kids strike me as thoughtful, immediate, thinking, analysing, rocking, and sweet, which to me is what Nirvana was about.

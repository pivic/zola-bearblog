Courtesy of Michael Newton's "The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers", second edition, the small ((Pun most definitely intended.)) entry on Dimitris Vakrinos is poetic justice, in a way:

> A quick-tempered Greek who stopped growing at five feet four inches ((1,62 meters.)), taxi driver Dimitris Vakrinos was arrested on April 9, 1997, at the climax of a one-man crime spree that had spanned the best part of a decade. In custody, he confessed to five murders, six attempted murders, one attempted rape, four armed robberies, and one attempted robbery. His victims were to blame, Vakrinos told police, for having mocked his sawed-off stature. Held without bail pending trial, Vakrinos committed suicide on May 12, using his own shoelaces to hang himself from a showerhead in the prison's isolation ward--a trick, ironically, that might have proven unsuccessful for a taller man.

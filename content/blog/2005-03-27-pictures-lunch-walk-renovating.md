[Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-03-27) is a small collection of pictures from our walk today. Mikaela's just finished a first coat of paint on the shelves; another's due, as soon as we get another type of paint to finish it off with. Then it's up with books and DVD's! Also, in the collection you'll find pictures of regular Swedish suburbian houses. Note the meat-coloured ones and the tiger carpet. Bastards!

[![The Rules of Attraction](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1176049740m/586652.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/586652.The_Rules_of_Attraction)[The Rules of Attraction](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/586652.The_Rules_of_Attraction) by [Bret Easton Ellis](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2751.Bret_Easton_Ellis)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/136430723)  
  
Just like the characters in the book present themselves, bored, intelligent and dozed-off with too much money, I think the content of this book is to be processed between the lines; as the pages drip with cynicism and glibness, the people behind the words develop and function. I'm glad to see Ellis' writing of collegial sex, drunkenness and drugs through the eyes of obviously intelligent creatures, as opposed to the common way of "politically correctly" finger-pointing at what's right and demonising what's wrong.  
  
The three main characters intertwine, lock and disperse throughout, as people do, in a variety of ways. Their personalities are unveiled as I read on, and I actually got a lot through this book. In a way, it was like opening somebody's diary; thoughts never said, love unrequited and cheap thrills, it's all here. School daze.

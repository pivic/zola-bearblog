Naomi Klein, dissenter and all-around sharp person, has produced the above video clip [together with The Intercept](https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/19/naomi_klein_coronavirus_capitalism).

Klein speaks both of how it's important not to let the rich politicians in charge give money to the wealthy at the expense of the poor and the middle class and of what hope we have.

Here be some quotes from “‘_[Coronavirus Capitalism’: Naomi Klein’s Case For Transformative Change Amid Coronavirus Pandemic.](https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/19/naomi_klein_coronavirus_capitalism)_” Democracy Now! March 19, 2020:

> **PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:** We are working very closely with the cruise line industry, likewise with the airline industry. They’re two great industries, and we’ll be helping them through this patch.

> **NAOMI KLEIN:** Bailouts for fracking companies, not to mention cruise ships, airlines and hotels, handouts which Trump could benefit from personally. Which is a big problem because the virus isn’t the only crisis we face. There’s also climate disruption, and these industries that are getting rescued with our money are the ones driving it. Trump has also been meeting with the private health insurers.

> **PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:** We’re meeting with the top executives of the health insurance companies.

> **NAOMI KLEIN:** The very ones who have made sure that so many Americans can’t afford the care they need. And what are the chances they don’t have their hands out? It seems like the whole pandemic is getting outsourced.

> **BRIAN CORNELL:** Well, Mr. President, thank you for inviting us here today, along with [our colleagues from Walmart](https://www.propublica.org/article/walmart-was-almost-charged-criminally-over-opioids-trump-appointees-killed-the-indictment) and Walgreens and our partners at CVS. Normally you’d view us as competitors, but today we’re focused on a common competitor. And that’s defeating the spread of the coronavirus.

> **NAOMI KLEIN:** The Fed’s first move was to pump $1.5 trillion into the financial markets, with more undoubtedly on the way. But if you’re a worker, especially a gig worker, there’s a very good chance you’re out of luck. If you do need to see a doctor for care, there’s a good chance no one’s going to help you pay if you aren’t covered. And if you want to heed the public health warnings to stay home from work, there’s also a chance that you won’t get paid. Of course, you still need to pay your rent and all of your debts — medical, student, credit card, mortgage. The results are predictable. Too many sick people have no choice but to go to work, which means more people contracting and spreading the virus. And without comprehensive bailouts for workers, we can expect more bankruptcies and more homelessness down the road.

> Look, we know this script. In 2008, the last time we had a global financial meltdown, the same kinds of bad ideas for no-strings-attached corporate bailouts carried the day, and regular people around the world paid the price. And even that was entirely predictable. Thirteen years ago, I wrote a book called _The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism_, described a brutal and recurring tactic by right-wing governments. After a shocking event — a war, coup, terrorist attack, market crash or natural disaster — they exploit the public’s disorientation, suspend democracy, push through radical free market policies that enrich the 1% at the expense of the poor and middle class.

> But here is what my research has taught me. Shocks and crises don’t always go the shock doctrine path. In fact, it’s possible for crisis to catalyze a kind of evolutionary leap. Think of the 1930s, when the Great Depression led to the New Deal.

We need to keep fighting companies like Facebook, who claim to help their employees but [won't protect their most vulnerable](https://theintercept.com/2020/03/17/facebook-coronavirus-bonus-contractors/).

Keep fighting with Naomi.

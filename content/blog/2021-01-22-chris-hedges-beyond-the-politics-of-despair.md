Chris Hedges.

I urge you to listen to this speech by Chris Hedges in 2020:

It'll be gone soon, but you can [buy it in different formats from Alternative Radio](https://www.alternativeradio.org/products/hedc015/).

Synopsis, via Alternative Radio:

> Despair. We all experience it. It can lead to demoralization. What’s the antidote? Engagement. Finding kindred spirits and acting collectively. Building bonds of solidarity. Working toward the common good. John Lewis, long-time Georgia Congressperson and civil rights icon had this advice: “Do not get lost in a sea of despair. Be hopeful, be optimistic. Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble.” Recorded at the Sanctuary for Independent Media.

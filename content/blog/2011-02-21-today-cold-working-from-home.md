My body's frozen! Woke up this morning with chills and a throat that felt as though I'd inhaled pure ice all night, but after having downed two cups of tea and one coffee, I think it's getting better. Yeay! Blixa's in my lap and I'm getting some work done, which all amounts to feeling good.

Now all I'll do is more work and then wait for X who's working. I long! Why can't time move by any faster?

This weekend X's mother came by with her man. I tried to entertain them when they arrived, while X worked. _Yes_, I stayed at home while X, schooling herself full-time, was at her new work-place. I can only say we're going against those gender stereotypes. And _yes_, I will be attempting to spoil her rotten when she comes home tonight, in need of lavish care and attention having first trained her brain, then honed her new skills at work.

[Frederic](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-08-19/images/PICT0057.jpg) invited us to come for dinner, so we went. He dined us with smoked salmon, beans, a nice dressing and bulgur, which is basically a lot more nice than cous-cous. His female cat, Sompie, was sterilised almost two weeks back, so she was wearing a protective shield that sprung from her neck up to cover her head, so that she wouldn't lick her wound. Of course, [she hates it](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-08-19/images/PICT0054.jpg).

[Here are a lot of pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-08-19) from the trip to Aspudden, where Frederic lives, and a lot of pictures of the cats. His other one is on a diet, as it's too fat. The veterinarian said Sompie is a little fat as well, but is in no way near the Masterful Lardness of the other one. [Here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-08-19-sompie.mov) is a quite dark film \[MOV, 13MB\] showing the crippled cat doing what it currently does best: limping.

After the dinner we watched "[Chuck&Buck](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200530)", a fantastic and pure film about Chuck, who loses his mother and tries to regain what he and Buck shared when they were the best of friends, appx. 15 years back. I highly recommend this film. The soundtrack will probably get on some peoples' nerves, but it's actually compiled by [Joey Waronker](http://www.angelfire.com/mac/keepitlive/drummers/Waronker/waronker.htm) and [Smokey Hormel](http://smokeyandmiho.com), who both have played live and on record with [Beck](http://www.beck.com), and is very good. I think it goes hand-in-hand with what Chuck seems to think and feel in the film. Also noteworthy is the theme song which is the real nerve-twister. I like it, but then again, I'm used to Belle And Sebastian, so [click this link](http://www.gwendolyn.net/gtg/med/ooodily.mp3 ) and DL 1,45MB's of MP3 sunshine.

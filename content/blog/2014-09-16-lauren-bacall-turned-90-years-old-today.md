**[Lauren Bacall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Bacall)** should have turned 90 years old today, but she is gone. From her autobiography, to cheer us up:

> Cole Porter’s song ‘Don’t Fence Me In’ was on the Hit Parade and Bogie’s first wire to me said, ‘Please fence me in Baby – the world’s too big out here and I don’t like it without you.’ No one has ever written a romance better than we lived it.

Looking back, this was the most lovely New Year's Eve I've spent.

In the morning X and I spent a glorious few hours together in love and calmness. It was serene and great, I really can't and won't tell more about it, ha! We later met up with T&D to get food, which proved near impossible as the place we went to was out of loads of stuff, lo and behold. T's girlfriend was at another place and got the missing ingredients though, yaah! T&D had even had time to assemble beverages for the evening...lovem. D joined us and we all went to T's mom's apartment in Gamla stan where we cooked three different courses and played a lot of Guitar Hero and SingStar. The dishes were varied: a starter made up from sliced baguette, mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil. Super! The entrée was filled, oven-grilled paprikas, sooo great, filled with rice, cheese and other delicious condiments. The dessert was ricotta-mixed pancakes with strawberries; actually, the ricotta didn't blend well with the oat-based pancakes we made. It would have been better without the cheese, but with honey it was sweet and tasty, especially considering the drinks we had it with. And the company! Laughter and friendship, love and fun.

In-between all we also celebrate the midnight switch between 2008 and 2009 as you can see below, at Skeppsholmen. Flashy fireworks as X and I held each-other close was blissful and I won't forget it; sounding schmaltzy, I know, but the warmth between our bodies warmed my entire body even though it was freezing outside. None of us opened the bottle of bubbly we'd brought with us, and we briskly made our way back to the apartment after the extravaganza was over.

  

X and I went home after a long while waiting for the freakin' train which was late forever. The day after we started the slippery slope towards getting ill, which led to full-blown lying down and finishing [a book on Einstürzende Neubauten](http://allconsuming.net/item/view/5518781) and starting [another](http://allconsuming.net/item/view/5536024) on [the camorra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camorra).

The only thing to be in 2009 is...

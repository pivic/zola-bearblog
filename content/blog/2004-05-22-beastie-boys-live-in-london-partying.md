I'm (as you should!) currently listening to [the Beasties' concert in London](http://www0.bbc.co.uk/radio1/alt/zanelowe/beastie_boys.shtml), where they apparently put on a great show, and I think the coming album will surprise people more than "[Hello Nasty](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDSUB040312261145551591&sql=Aizduak4kjm3p)" did when it arrived, even though "Ch-Check It Out" is less of a great single than "Intergalactic". I'm hoping for something closer to "[Paul's Boutique](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDSUB040312261145551591&sql=Ai7fe4j570way)"; everything is possible with [Mixmaster Mike](http://www.realtimeinfo.co.uk/beats/biog/mixmastermike1.htm), and if they're (like Beck's coming album is) produced by [The Dust Brothers](http://www.dustbrothers.com), I think it has the ingredients needed to become a classic. The album, due 2004-06-15, is called "[To The 5 Boroughs](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDSUB040312261145551591&sql=A81apqjkwojka)"

Yesterday Mikaela and I went to [Moderna Muséet](http://www.modernamuseet.se), which is now free of charge, to visit. We saw a lot of nice stuff, performance art, early Swedish expressionism and some really nice classics from the turn of the last century. I'm not too much for "classic" art; my fave painter is Vincent Van Gogh, and I love expressionism totally. I love art standing on its end, so to speak. On the way to Moderna, which is on a little isle, almost no-one we met was (probably, I mean, how can one tell for certain) Swedish. Most of them seemed to be Americans or French. It was strange to come across tourists that early! Most of them come by the truckloads during July-August.

After the museum visit, Mikaela went shopping and I went to meet [Anos](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-04-01/images/PICT0004.jpg) at [Snaps](http://www.snaps.org), where we met some of his friends: Rolle (together with his new girlfriend), Tove (with her new boyfriend) and Mr. Göteborg. After that I tagged along with them to a barbeque that one of their friends had. He lives near the very center of Stockholm city. Just outside his very nice apartment he put a grill where Rolle acted BBQ-master while the rest of us sat down. I wasn't hungry at all, and gracefully thanked no to the very nice people around me who offered me bits of their BBQ. How nice! Anyway, we drank on and continued to chat. I talked quite a lot with Tove and Rolle's girlfriend (whose name escaped me entirely) about everything ranging from the coming US election to Sex And The City. We all had a nice time, and after the barbecue retreated to the apartment, where we drank and spoke on, until Tove and her friend wanted to go to Carmen. At this point I felt I needed to move on, so I agreed to move. We three left the party (as nobody else wanted to follow, which was something I felt that Rolle didn't approve much of, which I felt was strange - I mean, was he jealous? He couldn't have been, or could he?) and I decided I'd go home. Carmen is a quite famous little pub in the south part of Stockholm, where a lot of 18-year-olds in trucker caps drink beers and smoke. As I don't smoke and don't care much for those environments, I stay clear of the place whenever possible. Pretty soon every place that offers alcohol in Stockholm are going to become smoke-free-environments. Yee-haw!

Today Mikaela bought [a fan](http://www.electrolux.se/node679.asp?prodid=13072) for the kitchen. We haven't had one up to now, so we're going to let the electrician fix that, a new lamp for the bathroom and our washing-up machine at the same time. Hopefully, hopefully, that will happen soon.

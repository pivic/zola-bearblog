This evening was spent at Mikaela's parents' house, where they made us Spanish dinner. As their oven is broken, Mikaela made a nice chocolate cake. José, Mikaela's dad, made a wonderful paella, and Sebastian, Mikaela's second-oldest brother, made a blackberry cake. Mmm good! The paella was terrific, very nicely balanced against two hams, lomo and jamà³n de Serrano, and also the freshness of the salad available. Some big, green olives were close at hand and so were gambas, very nice garlic-fried prawns that José had also made.

Take a look at the pictures [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-05-01-dinner) to see what went down.

Later, we watched pictures from the trip to Spain. Nice thing to do, really. The pictures were those I took, and I made a gift CD using freeware, i.e. [Picasa](http://www.picasa.com).

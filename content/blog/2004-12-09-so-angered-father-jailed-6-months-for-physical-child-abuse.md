[BBC News report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4080293.stm) of a parent being jailed for 6 months for hitting his son in public. Chief Superintendent Alan Cooper, of Greater Manchester police: "\[...\] witness describes the child being hit so hard he left the ground and slid across the pavement. I am satisfied that the officer acted appropriately."

The boy's father complains: "My partner had to look after our son and bring up our baby all on her own for six months because I wasn't allowed to be around."

No, perhaps you weren't allowed to be around as you hit a 3-year-old child so hard he left the ground. I'm totally against the death penalty, but I like to think that if I were to witness this abuse, I would have kicked his arse right back. With my luck I'm sure he's a kung-fu expert with a black belt, machine gun operated into his forehead and an ability to shoot lightning through his fingertips.

Anyway, sore bastard, poor son.

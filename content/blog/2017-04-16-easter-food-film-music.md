OK, that's not all but I've not got patience nor pics to say more about food. I've been too into watching films - "_[Manchester By The Sea](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4034228/combined)_" is extremely overrated if you ask me, and yes, I've seen "_[Fifty Shades Darker](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4465564/combined)_" which deserves 0 or possibly 1 point out of 10, mainly for being creepier and actually written even worse than the first film - and doing nothing much at all. Also, let it be known that I really want to see Olivier Assayas' "_[Personal Shopper](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4714782/combined)_", his second film with Kirsten Stewart. I love Assayas, ever since his "_[Summer Hours](https://www.criterion.com/films/473-summer-hours)_". I really liked "[_Clouds of Sils Maria_](https://www.criterion.com/films/28748-clouds-of-sils-maria)".

Also getting deeply into black metal, thanks to P3 Dokumentär and the book "_[Blod Eld Död](http://www.blodelddod.se/blog/?p=19)_" by Ika Johannesson and Jon Jefferson Klingberg ((Which is due for a release in English, in 2018)). I will write more about this in a relatively short while, but I can say that **[Abruptum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abruptum)**, **Dismember**'s "_[Like An Everflowing Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_an_Ever_Flowing_Stream)_" (really death metal, but whatever) and **[Darkthrone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkthrone)** - notably their "_[A Blaze In The Northern Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Blaze_in_the_Northern_Sky)_" - are currently what's up.

So to compensate, here's a black metalish picture of Blixa; may I also add that the more ugly, the less pretty the quality is, the more black metal something is. I'll probably get nailed to an upside-down-turned cross by someone who listens far too much to [Mayhem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayhem_(band)), [Shining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_(Swedish_band)), or [Dissection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection_(band)) because of this.

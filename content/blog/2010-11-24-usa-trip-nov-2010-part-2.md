**2010-11-10**

OK, I get max points for reinvoking halloween when it's not: driving and panicking isn't the best of combos, and I definitely did that after having been to the movies. But let me start at the beginning.

X and I went to The Galleria, a gigantic mall. It's said to be one of the five biggest malls in the USA. But first, we parked somewhere close to The Galleria, or so I thought; it went to show that area as _also_ part of the mall, like a terrorist cell. There were more cells. Everything was really, really big. Frightening sizes.

Having shopped around for hours, we retreated to my beloved [The Cheesecake Factory](http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com). Evelyn's Favorite Pasta is a dish where you get pipe rigate served al dente with loads of olive oil, peppers, broccoli, chili, grilled aubergine...oh, it's so good. And nice service to boot. Finished off with aeons of cheesecake; we couldn't finish it all so we did like Bobby would have got a box for it and threw it in the back of the trunk of our car for later.

Went to the cinema, which - needless to say - was big. Not a lot of people there, though. A lot of paintings covering the walls with pictures of movie couples like Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. And Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. So I think it's been a while since that finishing coat of paint. And during the film, somebody came in with a red torch in her/his back pocket, probably looking for anybody filming the film. We saw "_[Hereafter](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1212419)_", another film starring Matt Damon as a person with super-powers. No, not my cup of tea at all.

As we left the cinema the GPS went squirrely and I went panicky, which didn't match well while driving. I had a hard time with the very dark skies and all the routes off and on the highways and freeways. At one point, upon nearly entering a freeway, a person in a car in front of me stepped out, pointed at me and shouted "Drive! Drive!" as though she didn't exist and it were OK for me to drive through her and past the red light that hovered slightly over her head. Very weird scene indeed. I was in panic-mode, so I managed to ignore her with ease, which lead to her getting into her car and rolling away, thankfully while the lights were green.

This morning breakfast has consisted of peanut butter on bagels plus the last of the cheesecake from last night. Nutritious!

I've included the ability to translate this blog to a variety of lingos, so check for the flags on the right-hand side of this blog, a bit down. Apart from that, I've once again managed to get myself looking for a good photo gallery. Oh, brother. [Imagevue](http://www.imagevuex.com) looks very interesting, even though it isn't free. It's pretty configurable but then again I know as much about Flash as Mel Gibson knows about the holocaust. I'm lost!

It seems people are liking Windows Vista beta 1. Check out a little gallery of screen-shots [here](http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/0,1206,pg=0&s=26945&a=156757,00.asp). My fave feature is that an administrator is able to block games that ordinary users can play according to content: it's so specified, that you can actually allow games that contain "Depictions of blood" and at the same time block games containing "Blood and Gore". Check a screen-shot of the settings [here](http://common.ziffdavisinternet.com/util_get_image/10/0,1425,sz=1&i=102836,00.jpg). I wonder if a special [Rockstar Games](http://www.rockstargames.com)\-setting will be available? Could very well be, considering the content of their coming games [The Warriors](http://www.rockstargames.com/thewarriors) and [Bully](http://www.rockstargames.com/bully).

I don't game that much these days. The last game I was into was "[Area 51](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/562075.asp)", and the last one I finished was...ages ago! I'm not a master at games, unlike Brice Mellen, who's said to be able to kick anybody into a pulp in "[Soul Calibur 2](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/471044.asp)". Oh yeah, [I must mention he's blind](http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20050727/ap_on_hi_te/games_blind_gamer_1).

A couple of days ago I ordered flowers from [Interflora](http://www.interflora.se), to be delivered to my grandmother who's turned 93 years old today. Wee! What's not wee, however, is the fact that they've screwed up. Either that or my grandmo's drunk - I just called her and asked whether she's had any visits or even received any flowers today. She had indeed received flowers, from an old couple she hangs with. Drat! I just called Interflora, heard the slow first message, pressed "1" to get to speak to somebody about an Internet order, and then...was told their service was closed for the day. Bastards. Why not state they were closed to begin with? Bastards! My grandmother's apparently not getting flowers from me today. I'll be sure to ask for a full refund, if the people at Interflora don't have a very good excuse for me tomorrow. I felt like an ass when talking to my grandmother just a few minutes ago.

**edit**: my mom just got in touch with me and told me Interflora had indeed delivered said flowers yesterday. They did so quite late, and my grandma loved the flowers, apparently. Kewl, granny!

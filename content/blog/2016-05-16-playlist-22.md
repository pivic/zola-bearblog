Since I last posted a playlist some _forever_ months ago, it's more than time for a new one. You'll find embeddable playlists for both Spotify and Deezer at the bottom of this post.

Today marks the 50th anniversary since [**Beach Boys**'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys "The Beach Boys") "[Pet Sounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Sounds "Pet Sounds")" was released. Truly a seminal landmark in pop music and beyond, I'm looking forward to seeing **[Brian Wilson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson "Brian Wilson")** playing the entire piece at the [Primavera Sound festival](http://www.primaverasound.com "Primavera Sound Festival") in less than a month!

Also, **Manic Street Preachers** are celebrating the 20th anniversary of their great "[Everything Must Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Must_Go_(Manic_Street_Preachers_album) "Everything Must Go (album)")". I've included the last track from the re-release of the album, a teary-eyed distorted thing; I love the ending, the boxy radio-sounding quality where there's some guitar masturbation going on.

**[Holy Fuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Fuck)**'s new album named "_Congrats_" is coming very soon, and they've so far released two tracks, of which I love "_Tom Tom_" the most. However, the song "_Xed Eyes_" is a lot fucking better with [this tripped-out video extravaganza](https://www.nowness.com/story/holy-fuck-xed-eyes) to aid it.

**[Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Clark_(musician))**, the fine electronics artist, has made the soundtrack for "[The Last Panthers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Panthers)" - a TV-series that's mainly known for [David Bowie consciously providing the theme song for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6J44zGDb6g) - which is calm and instrumental, dark and droning.

I just found out about **[Anoushka Shankar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoushka_Shankar)** today. What a track. This video is actually even more powerful than the track by itself, where she's playing the track - which is written by Ravi Shankar, her father - with Tanmoy Bose (tabla) and Kenji (Tampura) at the Neurosciences Institute:

...and, writing of powerful musicans:

[![silvanaimam](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/silvanaimam.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/silvanaimam.jpg)

**[Silvana Imam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvana_Imam)** is one of the best rappers in Sweden. Although I've found her new album, "_[Naturkraft](https://open.spotify.com/album/1WUagXFvCh1pnAj9hJSFnp)_", to be patchy in terms of quality, when she lights up, she sets off. This track is one of the brighter moments.

[![sleighbells_wide-6be57ed32527a1f831bb72fce02ed22fc4e9fa9e (1)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/sleighbells_wide-6be57ed32527a1f831bb72fce02ed22fc4e9fa9e-1.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/sleighbells_wide-6be57ed32527a1f831bb72fce02ed22fc4e9fa9e-1.jpg)

It took me a lot of time, but when I saw the trailer for Sofia Coppola's "_[The Bling Ring](https://youtu.be/GkfxKYIyni8)_", I quickly learned that there's apparently more to **[Sleigh Bells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleigh_Bells_(band))** than I first thought. Even though that track, "_Crown On The Ground_", is a perfect mix of distortion, guitar, melody and voice, I just love "_Infinity Guitars_", so it's here.

[![Grigory_Sokolov](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/Grigory_Sokolov.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/Grigory_Sokolov.jpg)

**[Grigory Sokolov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Sokolov)**, what a dude. Even though he was a virtuoso piano player, he let his emotions take the lead. I really enjoyed his outbursts and shit. Also, check this vid, it's a like a rollercoaster ride:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5TSan3JUrc

From that to: **[Death Grips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Grips)**.

[David Bowie liked them](http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/11/david-bowies-new-album-%E2%98%85-was-also-inspired-by-death-grips/), according to Tony Visconti. I've gotta say, even though the band's over, they've released quite some material since. Their latest album, "[Bottomless Pit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Grips#2015.E2.80.93present:_Bottomless_Pit)", from where this track is picked up, is their best yet if you ask me. And it's a ride, too, a high-octane one.

**[Steve Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mason_(musician))** was once in mighty [The Beta Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beta_Band), whose "_[Dry The Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsbR2dEmHGc)_" will forever light some way. However, he went somewhat ill and then a lot better, and his latest album attests to his song-writing capacity, even to his great voice. Akin to [Doves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doves_(band)), get in there.

[Thanks to Rough Trade](http://www.roughtrade.com/albums/101427), I've just discovered **[Karl Blau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Blau)**. His latest album, "_[Introducing Karl Blau](http://bellaunion.com/2016/02/introducing-karl-blau-due-130516/)_", is a great country rock one. Go listen. And yes, he reminds me of a certain Patrick Pestorius.

[![creative-halloween-costumes-1](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/creative-halloween-costumes-1.png)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/creative-halloween-costumes-1.png)

**[Mogwai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogwai)** are always Mogwai, and this is one of their best tracks. They've recently-ish released a compilation named "_[Central Belters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Belters)_", which I recommend if you haven't heard them before.

As for **[the Furries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Furry_Animals)**, I've [just covered this track](https://niklasblog.com/?p=18920) - which is grand - so find out for yourself; fingers will be crossed for an album to be released onto the world as soon as possible.

**[Lakker](https://lakker.wordpress.com)** have just released their second album - they actually refer to it as a "maxi EP" - “[Struggle & Emerge](https://lakker.wordpress.com/2016/05/14/struggle-emerge/)”, which is a more varied techno album than their first one, which I loved. This is the loveliest song off the new album.

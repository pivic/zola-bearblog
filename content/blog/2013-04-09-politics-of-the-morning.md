[Rather Be Dead by Refused on Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com/search/song?q=Refused%20Rather%20Be%20Dead "Rather Be Dead by Refused on Grooveshark")

While reading Noam Chomsky/David Barsamian's "[Power Systems: Conversations on Global Democratic Uprisings and the New Challenges to U.S. Empire](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538352-power-systems)", I've been listening to Refused. Killer combo.

From the book:

> If you look at the record of who is designated a terrorist, it’s shocking. Maybe the most extreme case is Nelson Mandela, who just got off the terrorist list about four years ago. \[...\] Saddam Hussein was taken off the terrorist list in 1982 so the United States could provide him with agricultural and other support that he needed." (Noam Chomsky re. the US state list of terrorists, during a speech in January, 2012.)

...and:

> We’re soon going to be commemorating the eighth century of Magna Carta. Magna Carta was a huge step forward. It established the right of any freeman—later extended to every person—to be free from arbitrary persecution. It established the presumption of innocence, the right to be free from state persecution, and the right to a free and fair speedy trial. That later was expanded into the doctrine of habeas corpus and became part of the U.S. Constitution. This is the foundation of Anglo-American law and one of its highest achievements, but it’s now being cast to the winds. One of the most remarkable examples is of Omar Khadr, the first Guantánamo case to come to a military commission—not a court—under Obama. The charge was that he had tried to resist an attack on his village by American soldiers when he was a fifteen-year-old boy.12 That’s the crime. A fifteen-year-old tries to defend his village from an invading army. So he’s a terrorist. Khadr had been kept in Guantánamo and, before that, Bagram in Afghanistan for eight years. I don’t have to tell you what Guantánamo is like. He finally came to a military commission, where he was given a choice: either plead not guilty and stay here forever or plead guilty and just spend another eight years in detention.13 This violates every international convention that you can think of, including laws on treatment of juveniles. Of course, it grossly violates any principle. He was fifteen. But there was no public outcry. In fact, particularly striking in some ways is that Khadr is a Canadian citizen. Canada could extradite him and free him if it wanted to, but they didn’t want to step on the master’s toes.

And Morrissey has finally chimed in regarding the death of Margaret Thatcher:

**Edit, 2013-04-10**: Morrissey has published a response to the responses from the media on his above chime:

<script type="text/javascript">(function() {if (!window.CLIPBOARD || !window.CLIPBOARD.widgets) {var elem = document.createElement("script");elem.type = "text/javascript";elem.async = true;elem.src = "//clipboard.com/js/widgets.js";var s = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(elem, s);}})();</script>

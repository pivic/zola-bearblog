Last time this happened to Eminem, his album was pushed back in time, as opposed to it now being sold four days previous to its release date. Anyway, I'm sure he's going to cash in for it, just like with Snoop Dogg. The difference should be Snoop's album could be crap and Eminem's mostly good. So I've heard. So I've heard other people say! More on this [at the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3985119.stm).

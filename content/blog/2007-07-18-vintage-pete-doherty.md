MTV reports amongst youths queuing to purchase a then-new Oasis album, and guess who's highlighted - our own QPR fan laying down his QED saying he's always been a cunning boy! Pete Doherty, ladies and gentlemen, making his appearence appx. ten years ago.

Here's a quick transcript for you:

> MTV: Good morning, you're in the queue, you've got your croissant ((Thanks to Christine for sorting this out for me, I first thought the man said "crass"!)) out, you're sorted; how long have you been here? PD: Oh, at least 17 minutes. MTV: Oh right, so you're a newcomer to this. PD: Yeah, yeah. MTV: Can you sum up Oasis for me in one sentence? PD: Yeah, well, I subscribe to the Umberto Eco view that Noel Gallagher's a poet and Liam's a town crier.
> 
> _Interviewer thinks Pete's done and whisks away the mic; Pete comes up with more and pushes forth to say more, gets the mic shoved in his face._
> 
> PD: Sorry about that; I've always seen that as a perfect combination, y'knowwhaddImean? MTV (to camera-person): Did you hear that? Can we do it again? That was brilliant. (to Pete) Please look at the camera and do that.
> 
> PD (to camera): I subscribe to the Umberto Eco view that Liam's a town crier and Noel's a poet and that's always, for me, a perfect combination. MTV: If there was one word to sum Oasis up, what would that word be? PD: "Trousers". MTV: D'you wanna be a presenter? PD: (nods while smiling) MTV: This guy's brilliant. Nice one, thanks a lot.

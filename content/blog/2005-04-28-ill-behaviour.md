I spent today at home, basically doing nothing (except spending appx. an hour working). I had to cancel the Excel course for tomorrow as I'm utterly sick. My throat is jammed, my wind-pipes are working over-time and I feel like just falling into a coma at any minute. This week-end I was supposed to help \[avatar:/bilder/avatars/rade.gif\]Rade\[/avatar\] move to Eskilstuna, but that's hauled off-line as well. Bwah. My work and social life is shattered due to this crap. And then came the bomb - \[avatar:/bilder/avatars/mikaela.jpg\]Mikaela\[/avatar\] had to leave work early as she, too, is ill. Hopefully we'll be better tomorrow evening, when we're hosting a Spanish dinner for \[avatar:/bilder/avatars/patrik.gif\]Patrik\[/avatar\], \[avatar:/bilder/avatars/staffan.gif\]Staffan\[/avatar\] and \[avatar:/bilder/avatars/fdp.gif\]Frederic\[/avatar\]. Then Frederic will lend me his [Nikon D70](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Nikon/nikon_d70.asp) for a while; finally, a chance to use a real digital system camera.

[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-28-elmaquinistathum.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-28-elmaquinista.jpg)Today I saw "[The Machinist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361862)", a Spanish-American production directed by Brad Anderson, starring Christian Bale. I think most people know about this film from Bale being extremely thin in it; he plays a machinist who is unable to sleep properly, and doesn't care much for food. To DeNiro himself into shape, Bale ate a can of tuna and an apple a day for I-don't-know-how-long, but forget all that; the film is very good. OK, the story has a few lapses, and despite the fact that Bale's body steals the show for the first minutes of the film, it still flows very well. The film reminds me strongly of "[Memento](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144) ", "[Fight Club](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523)" and "[The Mothman Prophecies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265349)", which has a little to do with the story and plot, but mostly with the extremely well-done style and feel of the film. The cinematography, the acting, directing and, very interestingly as it mimics Bernard Herrman's soundtracks to a certain extent, the soundtrack.

First: the cinematography. The film is beautifully photographed. Check out [these pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-04-28-machinist) and you'll see bits of what I mean. I'm definitely no pro at photo, but this is excellent lighting, and I think every character in the film and every inanimate object are extremely well-weighed against each-other, definitely reminding me of what people like David Fincher are extremely good at: style.

The acting: there isn't a bad actor in this indie production. A lot of the characters left a bad taste in my mouth - but only because they were to. Even an old dragon like Michael Ironside does his bit in lifting this way above what every actor in "[Saw](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387564)" must be dying to be able to do. This is a very successful marriage between two continents. Bale does his character very well, and Aitana Sà¡nchez-Gijà³n plays her part nicely. Of course, Jennifer Jason-Leigh plays a part that Juliette Lewis can only dream of being able to do as well, and Ironside's cynical passive aggressivity is very well-played. I can't go into their respective parts much without giving the plot away, which I don't want to do.

The style and soundtrack: the cinematography (by Xavi Giménez and Charlie Jiminez) strongly reminds me of [David Fincher's](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000399) and [Chris Cunningham's](http://www.director-file.com/cunningham). The style is more reminiscent of a film noir story though, as this is a quite hard-boiled story; things are shown in their most basic environments, by which I'm referring to what Kubrick did with "[2001](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622)" (and a few other of his films): there is often very little, if anything, shown in-screen that isn't thought of before-hand. Also, there are almost no commercial logos or product name-dropping feature in this film. All in all, I'm surprised the film-makers managed to present such a sterile environment and yet keep the characters so real.

The soundtrack has helped the film immensely. Brad Anderson, the director, [has written about the music in the film](http://www.movienet.com/machinist.html), which is interesting reading indeed; Roque Baà±os' soundtrack is only (as far as I've found - any tips about other places to find it would be highly lauded) available through [this page](http://www.filmaxmusic.com/music.php?url=album/disco43.htm). Using a theremin is one thing, getting a person who really can play it is another, and its very special sound really blends in well with the other noir-ish sounds, creating an atmosphere that matches the film perfectly.

Yeah, the film is very good, even though some bits are definitely (in my opinion) not in place. I highly recommend this film for all to see.

Today I've scoured through the functions available in my little [Minolta Dimage E323](http://www.steves-digicams.com/2003_reviews/e323.html), while lying in the sofa at home, photographing vegetables and clouds. Sounds really interesting, right? Wait! It's not. I did go through exposure, and what I could do through it. It's very interesting to balance exposure levels by hand instead of relying on the camera to auto-pick one for you, even if it does do a fairly good job at that itself. It'll be really interesting to see what I can produce with Frederic's Nikon D70, considering I'll then be using a 18-70mm Nikkor lens, which will increase contrast and picture angle dramatically. Sure, my current camera has 3,2 megapixels while the D70 sports 6,1 megapixels and is so much more than a little camera, so there really are no valid comparisons to be made. I'll report back with pictures instead. Anyway, [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-04-28-foodnphoto) is the little picture gallery from my photographing using the E323 and going through exposure stages.

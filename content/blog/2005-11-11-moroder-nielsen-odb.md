I just came across [this post](http://musicthing.blogspot.com/2004/12/moroder-week-pt-1-i-didnt-know-he-did.html) on Giorgio Moroder, which lists a few tracks he's made, but the real gem is [this single](http://members.tripod.com/~szelazny/brigit.html). It poses merely one simple question: how the hell did Giorgio agree to produce that clownboat? I don't care if it's because he made a lot of money or he was bound by an ill-advised previously signed contract, but he's sure going to hell for it. OK, he may be let off the hook as he did produce the best song ever, which of course is Donna Summer's "[I Feel Love](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Feel_Love)". Yeah, that's right. If you have any other opinion, I've brought news: you're wrong. If you think [the lyrics](http://home.concepts.nl/~avroomen/ifeellov.htm) are a bit thin you're wrong as well.

But, what about Brigitte Nielsen? What do you have against her? I don't care about non-musicians turning singers just because of their fame. In some instances this can actually be a good thing, eh, as was the case when...ehm. Yeah, that's it. There is no case available. Tip me if I'm wrong, even though I'm infallible. No, I don't care about Kate Moss' humming on the new album by Babyshambles (not to mention her making music with Primal Scream previously), Juliette Lewis trying to act like she could sing in "Natural Born Killers" or Bruce Willis, or...yeah.

Suddenly, I miss [ODB](http://www.ibrecords.com/journal/uploads/ODB.jpg) more than ever. Pick up "[Nigga Please](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:9ea9qj7loj0a)", turn your system up, play "I Can't Wait" and sing along until you die.

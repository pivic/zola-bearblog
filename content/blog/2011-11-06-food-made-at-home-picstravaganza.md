I've just transferred a bunch of semi-old pictures from my camera, so here they are!

There's nothing like home-made pizza. Oh well, we cheated a bit by purchasing the dough but the rest was home-made! Lovely combo: mozzarella cheese and artichokes.

Some easy-made, autumny soup. Quite salty, yet filled with stock, cheese and herbs, it turned out very full-bodied and filling.

Nothing wrong with a fruit salad to fill you up! This was great, apart from one fruit that was yellow and very spiky on the outside, yet tasted less than your average cucumber but with a consistency of being too ripe. Left that out, and what was in the salad was papaya, kiwi, grapes, passion fruit and honey melon.

One can never have enough pineapple cake. And this one was sweeet and wet and the opposite of tangy, yet very good. I love cake.

Yes, I almost finished this by myself, leaving nothing for X. I'm such a bad husband.

Oh yeeees. So easy to make. Just dress up the cheese, flop it into a pan for a while, then lay on a bed of salad and what-you-want and drizzle with a balsamic vinegar-based dressing and you're set.

This soup is also very easy to make, but add love and affection and it turns from being plain to something magnificent. It's sweet potatoes as the base, More autumnal food.

Facon ((Vegetarian version of bacon; we don't buy it to imitate bacon though.)), pasta and pasley with a sauce, all that counts.

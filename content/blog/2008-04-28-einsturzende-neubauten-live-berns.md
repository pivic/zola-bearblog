X and I went to see them live, but unfortunately Berns has non-existing air-conditioning and hence we avoided death and left the venue while the third song was playing. I felt so ill I almost thought staying would be a good idea, which probably can be compared with the feeling people who are freezing to death get, experiencing that they're very warm just as they're about to die.

After a bit of conferencing with X, we agreed on leaving. I felt like I was snatching her away from a band she really wanted to see, but in the end, we both needed to leave.

After all, we got to see Neubauten in their glory. Blixa. As he sang through "_Nagorny Karabach_" and Hacke hit his trademark bass-style, I felt at home. And I felt utterly sick from there being no air whatsoever in the venue, with people behaving like ogres. Perfect proof of this was a 40-year-old man who jumped onto the little mini-stage X and I stood on, just ahead of her, so that she couldn't see a damned thing. Wankers.

The band, though. It was lovely to hear them. We'll see them again, no doubt, as I'm quite sure they'll pop up just when we least expect it. We purchased some merch before we went home, e.g. a singlet and the book [No Beauty Without Danger](http://www.neubauten.org/xcart/product.php?productid=16135). We carried this home in a black Neubauten plastic bag with the logo in gold. Sweet.

On the other hand: I curse you, [Berns](http://www.berns.se)! Get your AC in order, or I'll...curse you more.

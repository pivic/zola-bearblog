**[Edward S. Herman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_S._Herman)** became 92 years old. He is probably best known for developing the [propaganda model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_model "Propaganda model") of media criticism with [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky").

Together with Chomsky, he wrote "_[Manufacturing Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent)__"_, a seminal book for me, also one of the best books I've ever read.

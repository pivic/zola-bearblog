[![The Magnetic Fields](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/104574-magnetic_fields.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/104574-magnetic_fields.jpg)

**[The Magnetic Fields](http://www.houseoftomorrow.com/tmf.php)** is a band on its own little pedestal high up in heaven. As such, more and more people deserve to hear them. [Stephin Merritt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephin_Merritt), the front person of the band, is a truly great lyricist and songwriter, and the band is filled with great musicians and singers. This is some [Brill Building type of shit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brill_Building#Writers).

Even though I still maintain that [**X's Magnetic Fields playlist**](https://niklasblog.com/?p=12752) is the best so far, the below one (for both Spotify and Deezer) is [Stereogum's "10 best songs"](http://www.stereogum.com/1379972/the-10-best-magnetic-fields-songs/top-stories/lead-story). Anything to get people hooked on this band, I say. So see the Stereogum playlist as a short intro, and X's playlist to delve even further, before listening to the albums as a whole; that's just a tip. Listen to them however the fuck you want, naturally speaking. I'm not really gonna tell you how to listen to shit.

I've written quite a bit on the band's magnum opus, "**69 Love Songs**", [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=3310).

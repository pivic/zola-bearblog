![2009-08-15, wearing my snazzy new shades.](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2009-08-15-niklas.png)X and I got off to town pretty early, secured a good spot at [Drop Coffee](http://dropcoffee.blogspot.com) that allowed us to sit on the bench that Oskar recently built with Erik; one made entirely by themselves I may add. I'm no handy-man myself, so I pretty much gawk at any person capable of wielding a hammer or anything just as inexplicable to me.

A band was actually playing jazz in the little café, which was at that point quite filled with people, even though they were servicing indoors as well as out. Double-bass, drums and an electric guitar, sprawling melodies without song while X and I were drinking cappuccinos made from [Fazenda Da Lagoa](http://www.roastmasters.com/brazil-lagoa.html), which will be used as the "house coffee" at the café. It's quite sweet and has a clear, distinct taste. You know that you are at a café where people care a lot about the quality when they've even written the date when the coffee beans have been roasted on the price list on the wall. Not to mention a lot of other things but I won't say it, I'm a fanboy already. Or rather, a coffee nerd fag hag, the kind of person who thinks it's cool that some people possess infinite knowledge surrounding all things coffee. Asperger's Syndrome FTW.

Having tasted their house coffee, I also tried the brewed Costanza #3, from Cibao Altura in the Dominican Republic. Very lean, very nice for brewed coffee. It didn't make me go bonkers, which some coffees can do to me. Together with the chocolate cake that Erik proffered all for free, how could one resist all that was on offer at the place? We simply left, but not before I documented the stay in this video:

X and I basically crossed the street and ended up at [Bric-A-Brac](http://www.bric-a-brac.se), where we found a cardigan that X absolutely had to have. I mean, if she'd not wanted it herself I would have forced a purchase upon her. It suited her to a t. Exquisite! So, fired up by this purchase, we went past a place called Brandstationen where I got myself the above shades; I love them. I love them even more than the vintage shades I once owned, that a former quasi-friend threw from a pub in a fit of rage. Here's lovely X adorning said shades in the Zinkensdamm subway station:

Thanks to her photographic senses I think she made me look egoistical and movie star-ish in a photo she posted about today, right [here](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2009/08/15/saturday-shopping) on her blog.

We then left for home with our new stuffs, made an excellent dinner consisting of spaghetti, avocado and pesto, and then launched into what appeared to be the director's cut of "_[Watchmen](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409459/)_", a film I've been fearing and awaiting forever; I knew the film was going to be made at some point, and even though I hated the fact that the man who directed "_[300](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300%20%28film%29)_" was going to direct this one as well, especially considering the line of good directors that have devoted themselves to and then quit the entire project, but I was happy that [the Wachowski brothers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wachowski%20brothers) weren't into it. Anyway, we saw 1 hour and 30 minutes, and had to pause indefinitely, and that's less than halfway into the film. I will finish it, no pain. I must say that so far, Rorschach seems very like the character in the book, and Ozymandias is played better than I think Jude Law ((Incidentally, I just found out that Jude Law has a tattoo of Rorschach's "[double-r](http://images-3.redbubble.net/img/clothing/backgroundcolor:fafafa/bodycolor:heathergrey/size:large/style:mens/view:preview/2452879-3-rorschach.jpg)" off the "Watchmen" graphic novel, in some way. Really weird coincidence, that.)) would have done it, seeing that his fame would probably have overshadowed the rest of the actors completely ((Not to mention my girlfriend would have gone bonkers, but that's a different tale...)). The soundtrack is very sweet, hearing Dylan playing to the intricate start of the film was interesting; some of the cinematography is very nicely done, very true to the original graphic novel. I wonder what Alan Moore would say, but then again, [we know, don't we](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/09/alan-moore-on-w.html)? All in all, some fight scenes that made me cringe as they were raw, and some scenes where bodily harm was shown in ways that I think ought to be usual to see on film, but isn't. At the same time, why plant the freaking World Trade Center towers in the backdrop for nearly every scene? I can't say I'm longing to see the second half of the film, but rather, I wonder what I'll make of it as entirety.

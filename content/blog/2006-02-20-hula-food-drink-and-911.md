I'm thinking of installing [Hula](http://www.hula-project.org/Hula_Server) and running it as my personal e-mail and calendar server, with an address-book to boot. [The coming version of GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/~davyd/gnome-2-14), 2.14, will contain an updated version of [Evolution](http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution) (which "provides integrated mail, addressbook and calendaring functionality to users of the GNOME desktop") that jacks straight into a Hula-server. Not very strange though, as both Hula and Evolution are projects owned and run by Novell.

Mind you, it was [simple to set up the Hula-server](http://www.hula-project.org/Installation), and it works very quickly off Ubuntu. And soon enough, I'll gather strength to reinstall one of my laptops to [dual-boot Ubuntu and WinXP](http://www.hezardastan.org/breezy_xp_dualboot/en).

Yesterday I didn't do so much nerdish stuff, though, as I was actually lazy as hell. Well, I worked a bit on the afternoon - and had to go to into town to do it - but when the evening came we had delicious food that Mikaela and Sebastian had prepared, a very nice roasted meat-dish with beans, which had been doused with a well-ground smoked paprika-spice. Very interesting, and it added a wholly different dimension to the entire dish. Very nice indeed. When Mikaela asked her dad where you could buy that in Stockholm, he said you couldn't. "It's from the village", he said, referring to the village where he was raised. But we were lucky enough to walk away with a little bag of the stuff. Brilliant! We also had [Portal da Aguia](http://systembolaget.se/SokDrycker/Produkt?VaruNr=12550), a sweet-yet-full wine, filled with tastes of berries and darkness, it reminded me of [Moscatel de Setàºbal](http://systembolaget.se/SokDrycker/Produkt?VaruNr=8336), a liqueur I really like.

Before I say bye for the day, check [this free documentary](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5137581991288263801&q=loose+change) about "9/11", the American disaster. One can even download it from that site - even though you have to play it using a player from Google.

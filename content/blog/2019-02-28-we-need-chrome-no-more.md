Reda Lemeden has written [this article](https://redalemeden.com/blog/2019/we-need-chrome-no-more) about why one should avoid Google Chrome for web browsing. At the very least, the article questions Google's surveillance capitalism and a few reasons for those.

I've tagged my articles that question—to use an expression that is coined by Shoshana Zuboff—how companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft use people's private data with [surveillance capitalism](https://niklasblog.com/?tag=surveillance-capitalism).

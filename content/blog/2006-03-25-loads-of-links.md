My site may have been unrechable, but that hasn't stopped me from hoarding links!

First, Google is fighting [Reblog](http://reblog.org) by building the [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/things/tour). I think Google has a way to go before they can seriously challenge Reblog.

If you're on Windows, download the freeware [Fresh Diagnose](http://www.freshdevices.com/freshdiag.html). What's that?

> Fresh Diagnose is a utility designed to analyze and benchmark your computer system.

Speaking of good programs, you've got [portaPuTTY](http://socialistsushi.com/portaputty), "a hacked version of PuTTY that stores all its information in files, not in the registry", which means you can put it in a USB-memory.

Also, "watch TV and record video from any source" with [AVS TV Box](http://www.avsmedia.com/TVBox/index.aspx), a freeware Windows-tool. I haven't tried it yet, though.

Yesterday I was out with Tamara and Zak. For proof, [catch Zak rapping](http://www.vimeo.com/clip=57318). Well, croon, then. Just like [Morrissey singing "Girlfriend In A Coma" at SWSX](http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=577246487&n=2).

Writing on Morrissey, his coming album, "Ringleader Of The Tormentors", got [5/5 from The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1737694,00.html). [The Independent gives it 3/5](http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/music/reviews/article353188.ece), so they're worse off. How could they? He's only [turned sickness into popular song](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1739312,00.html), while [the record industry is becoming shittier](http://www.negativland.com/albini.html) and shittier, courtesy of Steve Albini. We're all happy that bands like The Kleptones exist, who have now released a new album that's available for download [here](http://www.kleptones.com/pages/downloads_24h.html).

For those of you who have a tough time knowing what themes in MS Office 2007 is all about, [this](http://blogs.msdn.com/excel/archive/2006/03/24/560596.aspx) is a great post about it. It shows you how this will serve to create templates that are almost guaranteed to make users use your Office 2007-files the way _you_ want them to.

If you've ever used Firefox for file-transfers or any other function that may cause Firefox to display [this message](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/uploaded/2006-03-23/unresponsive-script.jpg), you know it might actually disrupt everything you're doing, so get rid of it by using [this tip](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/firefox/put-off-firefox-15s-unresponsive-script-dialogue-162574.php), courtesy of Lifehacker.

Julien Temple, the man who made "[The Filth And The Fury](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236216)" about [Sex Pistols](http://www.sex-pistols.net), has now edited a lot of user-made video and [made a documentary about the Glastonbury festival](http://www.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1737684,00.html). Looks good and muddy. Strange, that. I'm really looking forward to the Beastie Boys concert-film, "[Awesome! I Fuckin' Shot That!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488953)".

If you need online storage-space for 2USD/GB/month, go to [rsync.net](http://www.rsync.net). This is no matter how much traffic you generate.

It seems Finland [no longer has _one_ serial-killer](http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkiller_index/by_country/fi.php), but two. A 30-year-old man has murdered his 54-year-old partner, is strongly suspected for two more murders committed in the 90's and is under suspicion for more. There is more info [here](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=148&a=531891), sadly only in Swedish.

And yes, [Wal-mart is still a turd-bag](http://www.guardian.co.uk/china/story/0,,1739319,00.html).

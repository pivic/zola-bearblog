Today the TV was installed! While I was playing NBA Live 2004 with Rade, using the old TV, the screen started acting up and turned yellow (as usual). At the same time, Mikaela had gone off to IKEA to check for the Bonden TV-bench that I have posted a picture of. It turned out that bench is discontinued - but that there were a few of them left in Stockholm, so Mikaela ordered one in Barkarby (which is a far way away from our home) and went. At the same time, ta-daaah, a delivery-man called and said he would come by a little later, with the TV, than we had discussed. I said we had not discussed anything, and that I've never spoken with him in my life, but if he was coming today, he was very welcome. He oh'ed and said he would come by in a little while. I asked how that long that would be, and he said 40-80 minutes. Sure!

He came by and delivered the TV, which Rade and I carried up to the apartment. Mikaela came home about 20 minutes after that. She quickly assembled the TV-bench and Rade and I lifted the TV onto the bench. [Here are a few pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-08-03-tv) of the scene with the old TV playing NBA Live 2004, and the big TV playing NBA Live 2004, and also from Formula 1 2004.

Oh, by the way, [USA lost](http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/summer04/basketball/news/story?id=1851520) against _Italy_ in basketball. That's nice. Bwahahahaha!

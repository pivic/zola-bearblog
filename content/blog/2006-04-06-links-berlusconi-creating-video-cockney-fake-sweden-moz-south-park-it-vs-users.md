[![Pirogues](http://static.flickr.com/39/123905627_d8659a0bf8_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=123905627)Mikaela made these pirogues yesterday; they're filled with cabbage and meat, ooh good. Speaking of dead meat:

If [Berlusconi](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3034600.stm) actually wins the Italian election on Sunday, I think he'll take [a few hints from Singapore](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060404/1038233.shtml); and Italy will be sent into shame for the coming years. And [the people will be on you like a leech](http://mfrost.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/7_2.jpg)! And they will ask questions about [your metaphorical self on the Internet](http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/35533) as if you were [some kind of idiot](http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060327fa_fact). Yes, [a real idiot](http://www.guardian.co.uk/drugs/Story/0,,1746333,00.html).

I just found [Jumpcut](http://www.jumpcut.com), another site where you can store videos - but that's not all. You can [remix](http://www.jumpcut.com/quickGuide/quickGuide_remix) your own or other videos, [create](http://www.jumpcut.com/quickGuide/quickGuide_create) some and [share](http://www.jumpcut.com/quickGuide/quickGuide_embed) it.

Searching the net is a daunting experience, but sometimes you find something noteworthy, that opens your eyes to the riches of another culture, that broadens your views of the world and essentially makes you feel better. [Cockney Rhyming Slang](http://www.cockneyrhymingslang.co.uk) is not such a site, but it is bleedin' funny. It seems this is the slang of choice for speaking [about hemorrhoids](http://www.cockneyrhymingslang.co.uk/english/compare/696/Piles-(hemorrhoids).aspx).

You want to know Sweden? Check [this](http://km.grogg.org/video/welcome_to_sweden.mpg), it's the most lying piece of scheisse I've come across in ages. This is a video of what's happening in Malm√∂ (a Swedish city), according to [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com), the right-wing so-called news-channel owned and controlled by [Rupert Murdoch](http://www.outfoxed.org). Of course, the moslems are all terrorists. Welcome to Sweden, liars.

Don't forget to catch "[My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts](http://bushofghosts.wmg.com/home.php)"! David Byrne and Brian Eno have remastered their 25-year-old masterpiece and are proffering the separated audio-tracks (i.e. the tracks divided into their respective layers) available for plundering, which means you can remix them, use the layers in your own songs, as long as you don't violate their license, as issued through [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org). Brilliant idea, lads.

Don't miss out on [this interview](http://www.nojesguiden.se/musik/article.asp?aID=12442) with Morrissey - in Swedish. If you care not for the Swedish lingo, do purchase the latest edition of Mojo magazine; it's the best interview with ye ole Mozza that I've read in quite a while.

[South Park won a Peabody award](http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/04/06/peabodyawards.ap/index.html). At last, at last, at last.

Slashdot, indirectly, spawned [this article](http://blogs.cio.com/node/228) called "Why IT and Users Hate Each Other", which is very interesting. I feel it somewhat touches what happens when people don't understand each-other, but can't exist without each-other. Very interesting, very inflammatory.

The reason?

> We will not include any Canadian dates on our world tour to promote our new album. This is in protest against the barbaric slaughter of over 325,000 baby seals which is now underway. \[...\] The Canadian Prime Minister also states that the slaughter is necessary because it provides jobs for local communities, but this is an ignorant reason for allowing such barbaric and cruel slaughter of beings that are denied life simply because somebody somewhere might want to wear their skin.
> 
> Construction of German gas chambers also provided work for someone - this is not a moral or sound reason for allowing suffering.

More about this, [here](http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_060327_02).

I've had a few interesting comments, when sending this to people. Let's count the ways...

**1**. "I guess he's also boycotting the USA, then."

I guess not, as the US government has no part in allowing Canada to kill the seals.

**2**. "He's fallen into the same trap as the others \[sic\]. Torturing humans is worse, I think."

I can't say anything about any trap by "others", whoever these are, but humans often have the chance to save themselves. Seals do not. I won't get into a, frankly, stupid debate on this, as seals obviously cannot escape people living off vanity.

**3**. "Why is Morrissey not evading Norway, then?"

I guess he doesn't know about their crimes against seals - or it could be he does, but that the current crime of the Canadian government is much larger than that of the Norwegian. Also, Morrissey is protesting against "the largest slaughter of marine animal species found anywhere on the planet".

**4**. "Why care, they reproduce anyway."

Obviously, this is thought stemming from a person who has often sniffed glue before taking math-exams.

**5**. "You don't know if the animals truly feel pain or not, so why care?"

You're right - yet nobody has tried to split your skull using a spiked club, so c'mere wontcha.

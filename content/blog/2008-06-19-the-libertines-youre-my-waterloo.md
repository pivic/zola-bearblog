Carl Barât, founding member of bands The Libertines (defunct) and Dirty Pretty Things (active and about to release their second album), is at the moment of writing this in hospital from [acute pancreatitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis), and may need an operation to pull through.

A few hours following his hospitalisation, Pete Doherty played a gig and dedicated "_You're My Waterloo_" to Carl.

All must hope for the best. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA8eXZ3IJww)'s the video for Dirty Pretty Things' latest single, "_Tired Of England_", from their coming album.

And here you will find "_You're My Waterloo_" as recorded in a studio. Enjoy.

Well, it wasn't _my_ birthday but it felt that way because I liked it so much. Anyway, that matters little: it was X's birthday, and as such we went out! Aah, the weather in Stockholm is currently absolutely lovely. That, paired with some wine and X conversing while wearing a Hope dress...I'm a very lucky guy, I tell you what! I really just wanted her to purr like a kitten.

We met up ((I still want to write "hooked up", as though that phrase would mean "met up".)) and shared a drink, laughs and secretive stories at [Utecompagniet](http://utecompagniet.se). I got bit by a horsefly and I'll interpret that as good luck, thank you very much -- and then went to **[Taverna Brillo](http://tavernabrillo.se)**, a really great little spot with very attentive waiters, very good food and very nice wine. Also, they currently have a 40% discount on food, so go reserve a table now!

_I don't care when or where I just care that you're there And that you will..._

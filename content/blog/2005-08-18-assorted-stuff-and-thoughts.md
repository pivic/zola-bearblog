Is there a better way to start the day, than with...the [two newly remastered Stooges-albums from Rhino](http://www.rhino.com/artists/stooges)? Bite my shiny non-metallic ass you can't! Hard garage from the days of yore, and if you're one of the young 'uns who's into Mötley Crüe and Poison, just throw that crap away and cut to this chase: The Stooges are real.

Who would want a keyboard with a LCD-screen that shows you instant messages and incoming e-mail? Apparently Logitech thinks [that'll be the new blast](http://news.com.com/2300-1041_3-5835525-2.html). I think that'll be as exciting as [blogging from MS Word](http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=1180).

I like [pictures on walls](http://www.picturesonwalls.com). That project's flowing through the minds of Banksy, Jamie Howlett and other inkers as well. If you're sneaky enough you'll find their offer where you can send them a self-addressed envelope and receive their calendar for this year. Only a little more than three months left on it, go go go! But you can always stay the bohemian you probably are, and start counting days from January 1st when you receive said calendar.

If there's any program for the Windows operating system that does [this](http://www.steelskies.com/coverflow/HomePage.html) to display digital album-covers, please, let me know.

Engadget's run [a list of a lot of reviews of the Nikon D50](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000557054630), which is almost replacing the D70 (as opposed to the D70s, which is very much the choice I'd make) in all stores. I like [Ken Rockwell's review](http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d50.htm) the best. By the way, Andreas tipped me about [Ffordes](http://www.ffordes.com), a silly-sounding name of a company that's interesting as it sells used camera equipment at reasonable prices. I still have no experience in shopping used lenses, so I still think I'm going to go with the new stuff whenever I get my next lens.

So, what happened to britpop? The jolly old BBC tries to make sense of it, right [here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4146424.stm).

From flickr, I stumbled onto [this article](http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/how_to/the_nonexpert_broken_hearts.php) on how to mend your heart when it's been broken by the love of your life. It's ficken hilarious.

Oh, and [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/34987571)'s my latest stitched panoramic masterpiece. My computer rendered it for 45 minutes, which doesn't mean a lot since it's old, but I can say it helped a lot.

I recently wrote [this post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=24400) about how Zoom users are tracked by the company, mainly when one uses their apps.

Vice Motherboard have uncovered [more privacy-oriented concern](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7e599/zoom-ios-app-sends-data-to-facebook-even-if-you-dont-have-a-facebook-account), mainly that the Zoom iOS app sends user data to Facebook, even if the Zoom user does not have a Facebook account.

A lot of people recommend [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/) as a far more privacy-oriented videoconferencing solution; there are also apps available for Android and IOS.

A lot of people use Zoom because they think one has to. We don't. Any company that takes your personal use and sells it to a company that's Facebook—nefarious beyond control—or pretty similar doesn't deserve your business, at the very least not when they're not addressing this in their privacy policy.

Consider how Zoom has abused their customers in the past, especially with how [they installed a web server on customer machines](https://www.howtogeek.com/427964/how-to-see-if-zoom-is-running-a-secret-web-server-on-your-mac-and-remove-it/) to circumvent security protocols (which _Apple_ killed on Macs) and [their monumental bug](https://www.howtogeek.com/427964/how-to-see-if-zoom-is-running-a-secret-web-server-on-your-mac-and-remove-it/) that allowed anybody to hijack your webcam.

**Edit**: Zoom have [fixed this issue](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/03/27/zoom-use-of-facebook-sdk-in-ios-client/) after this privacy issue was disclosed by Vice. Wouldn't it be far more interesting if they funded a decentralised non-Zoom privacy group?

Zoom also need to answer to [this](https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/03/27/zoom/).

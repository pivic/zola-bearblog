I'm very satisfied with my POD_xt_, in fact so satisfied I'm going to keep it. I haven't read through a fifth of the manual, which is really, really well-written and funny, and I haven't tried all of the functions of the software included with the package, but it's worth its money. I don't know how long it's been since I've been this happy with a product, in its entirety. Possibly when I bought my first iPod.

Anyway, here are two more demo recordings I've done: [a funk piece showing an auto wah-wah effect](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-09-05-funk.ogg), and [a little edited cover of Rage Against The Machine's "Know Your Enemy"](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-09-05-RATM.ogg), only with the arpeggio start and the intro.

Here are MP3 versions for those of you out there who are too arcane to switch to [Ogg Vorbis](http://www.vorbis.com), a far superior sound format. [Funk](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-09-05-funk.mp3) and [rock](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-09-05-RATM.mp3).

If I'd written that schmaltzy overture, I could compose well enough to happily decompose.

Almost a theme to being lost to yourself (in a bad way), the romantic, plodding gait of the track suggests a Lament, an adagio, a very late-night walk.

I love this fucking track. Hearing it while en route to work, riding what's in Stockholm called one of the green subway lines, which are mostly placed overground, the frosted landscape, with the sun coming up tinting things sparkling yellow, de-frosting all Swedes, it's just a stupefying thing.

Also, I see that Jean-Luc Godard has made the film to which this song is part of the soundtrack. It's called "_[Contempt](https://www.criterion.com/films/239-contempt)_", and I've not seen it.

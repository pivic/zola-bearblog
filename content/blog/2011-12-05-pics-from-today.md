Found inside our apartment complex elevator, "s√∂derort" is the part of Stockholm municipality that's south of the inner city. Gotta defend! Now, where's my neighbourhood [gat](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gat)?

I know it's hard to see in this shitty, unprocessed image, but there was a string of brightly coloured lights over the sky by [Lilla Bagis](http://www.lillabagis.se) this morning. Lovely!

This is part of what I found this morning when a colleague had "packaged" my stuff as I moved from one room to another. It's quite still here. No noise, not many people walking about. Feeling good about it.

A distant colleague turned 40 years old today, so there was cake. I didn't have any though, but that was just my choice. I'm not one for oh-there's-cake-gotta-eat, only in 99.997% of all cases.

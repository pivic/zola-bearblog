When in Manchester I saw a movie poster announcing a spin-off of one of my favourite horror films, "**[The Thing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787)**", made by John Carpenter, starring a surprisingly good Kurt Russell with a great soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. Here's the original trailer:

Yes, the effects are to some extent laughable, but I really love the dark feeling throughout the film - and I think it works! I remember it to, anyway. I can only wish it's still as good as I remember it to be. I want to see it on VHS! I love the video quality of the trailer.

Got reminded of the film from [this post](http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2011/nov/22/my-favourite-film-the-thing) in The Guardian; it contains spoilers.

So, Will and the gang (of Okkervil River) released some 11-year-old demos and diary recordings to the world yesterday!

> “Black Sheep Boy: Early Drafts On The Road, 2004": never-before-heard demos and rough drafts of these classic songs, recorded by Will on the road while the album was first starting to take shape. Also includes an audio “tour diary”…

Here's an outtake from a diary part, culled from the interim that's between "_Black Sheep Boy_" and "_In a Radio Song_":

Some front-porch action from Baton Rouge, pot-smoking stories, cat-walking, wild strawberries...it's as if Mayakovsky got high with Ingmar Bergman, I'm telling you. And it's dreamy. I love the harp part, merging into the song "_Black Sheep Boy_"...

Buy that stuff - including a limited-edition hand-made letterpress print of original art by Will Sheff (as seen above), showing his re-interpretation of William Schaff’s classic “_Black Sheep Boy_” cover - from [**here**](http://okkervilriver.portmerch.com/stores/product.php?productid=19727).

It's amazing to read [the positive responses](http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/latestnews/breakingnews/index.php?id=32) posted at www.michaelmoore.com, regarding “[Fahrenheit 9/11](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596)“, Michael Moore's latest documentary. It's not amazing that the responses posted are positive ones, but it's amazing to me, as (I like to view myself) an aware human being, to see American voices en masse in such a way. It's not been done before, methinks, at least not that I've been aware of, except for during the world-wide demonstrations against the latest war in Iraq. It's a scene that shows people care for other people, no matter how hard the current American government tries to frighten people into submission. Remember the Third Reich - remember Hitler, who didn't have the back-up that George W. Bush has, considering Dubya's family, their friends (among others, the bin Ladens) and the fact that the mentioned friends own 7% of the USA. There's a little nibbler for your thoughts.

I fail to see the protests against the film. It's biased? Of course it is. Michael Moore's just out to make a name for himself? He already has, through hard work. And even though he's now bigger than ever, I fail to see why people act hung-up about saying Moore sees himself as a saviour. I don't think he does.

The protests fall down incessantly, as the core of the film is displayed. George W. Bush is obviously one of the most corrupt presidents ever, leading his and his own family's ways to gain as much fortunes as possible, with no regard to law or ethics. Here are a few well-directed comments regarding the film, courtesy of IMDb user Jack Christal-Gattanella.

The film was in any case extremely disturbing, and a film all must see. I emphasise the “must", as the USA is the (without question) biggest terrorist state today, the only super-power that overthrows democracies one-by-one, in order to instate their own hand-picked (i.e. non-elected-by-the-people) dictators, the only modern super-power to have experienced a coup d'état in the latest 10 years without a following revolution and the only country that is currently experiencing a Lord of The Flies-like experience between its soldiers in a foreign country and the civilians.

Finally, the word goes to Dubya, courtesy of [The Complete Bushisms](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596/usercomments-110):

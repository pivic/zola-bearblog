OK, get ready for one of the worst songs you've ever heard. For background info on all of this, check [this](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1376) old post of mine; now you can find the entire album [here](http://drop.io/theworstsongs).

  

I have no idea where Background Mirror came from, where they were going or where they've gone, but I've got a feeling they've generated many a smile on their path to oblivion and infamy. They most likely were a Swedish garage band from the 1990s (and might very well have looked like [this](http://chaosrexmachinae.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/kd_family.jpg)). It's time to dissect this track thoroughly.

The first eight seconds of this track sounds like me at age 13, toying with an electric guitar and a really bad filter, but that's _the good part_ of the song; get ready as the clouds give way, the oceans part and **the most untight drummer in the world is unleashed**!

What the Hell? A guitar is quickly added, but it's so distorted it sounds as if somebody's recorded the pouring of sand onto the ground, and killed the bass frequencies on that recording. And wait - is that a bass in there?

This is the definition of utter mess, and there's one thing to complete all of this: the singer's voice and incomprehension.

I'm Swedish and I write this blog in English. Yep. I make mistakes, I know I won't pass for somebody born in an English-speaking country but I sure as hell don't form a metal band and write songs containing lyrical nunchucks, e.g.

> I music eyes? Into a dark side a tulip Your faded eyeball waits with me I hope you understood the roots that dead So many roots that turn my head Sometimes a guardian kill me dead It's like a poison to me I ain't what you seem I'm too scared to be Won't you set me free-a You belong to me-hee

The above is the dog-honest truth. OK, the last two lines almost make sense - but ultimately don't - but please, check [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com) before you hit the printers! What the **HELL**! I stopped transcribing due to lines such as "I can't hide from egg white", but I believe the true lyrical gem is unveiled at 02:52, where we hear the following trinket of truth:

> I have brought you tea I'm too scared to pee

Honesty at a whole new level; it's as if Morrissey never existed.

And **_what the hell_** ((No, I don't over-use this term; listen to the track and you'll find out for yourself!)) happens at 02:14? A guitar solo so powerful that it stops the bass and vocals and frantically frontal-crashes into a wall, splurting the very last from a decaying guitarist onto you, poor listener, for 17 seconds. Of pain. What. The. Hell.

Remember, please: don't kill the messenger.

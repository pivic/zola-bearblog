Yep, DJ Pivic and DJ X ((Formerly known as DJ Grepen.)) are DJ'ing again, tomorrow (2009-03-24) at Nada Bar & Restaurang, [åsögatan 140](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=59.3136138%2C18.0792147&hl=en&z=16&ie=UTF8) in Stockholm city. Free entrance, and expect to see us playing 21:00-01:00!

As [our last session](https://niklasblog.com/?p=2386) went very well, we've been invited back! So starting 21:00 we'll be giving you a euphoric feel that'll creep up your feet and smother you with life through the shitty weather we're having, making you forget your worries and permeate your senses for the best. Just entrust us with your life. All will fare well.

Examples of artists played in the past include Ladyhawke, The Libertines, Ace of Base, Okkervil River, Super Furry Animals, Mr. Bloe, Morrissey, Soulwax, Franz Ferdinand, Justice and Timi Yuro, so expect eclectic stuff and the unexpected. And yes, what we love and most probably will play no matter what. We're both deeply [digging our virtual crates](http://twitter.com/cyndamoore/status/1375047054)!

[Here](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=136324535156)'s the Facebook event and [here](http://www.last.fm/event/974349)'s the last.fm event, so there!

**update**: superstar [Zak has blogged about this](http://zakdaddys.blogspot.com/2009/03/nada-going-on.html) and will turn up as well! Sweeet. So far, 14 confirmed guests through Facebook.

Here's a little slideshow from the last time we DJ'ed:

Right now IÂ’M on the subway, which explains the bad typing. I went to meet Jesper, and then Peter, Stephan and Ocke tagged along. We went to a horrible pizzeria and then I headed home, its so good to be on the way home. And IÂ’m full on my way to becoming a tee totaller. It would be bliss apart from wine, whisky and some very choice beers. And Cristal, of course. Ha! Ive only drunk Cristal once in my life but it's the best champagne.

A few months ago, [I wrote about the kakapo](https://niklasblog.com/?p=3043), a loveable parrot. The biggest parrot in the world, actually, whose path I crossed when reading Douglas Adams' "_Last Chance To See_". Since a little while back, the BBC has started broadcasting a series of the same name, where the zoologist in the book ((Mark Carwardine.)) who followed Adams around, now treks more or less the same path but with Stephen Fry in it.

Here's a video from where they meet a kakapo. Magic.

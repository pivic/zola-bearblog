![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-02-11_gruff-candylion.jpg)Yep, Gruff's the lead singer of [Super Furry Animals](http://superfurry.com), and this track is one of several great ones from his quite recently released second solo album, "[Candylion](http://www.candylion.co.uk)":

Recorded at Super Furry Animals producer Gorwel Owen's house in Anglesey with the help of double bass player Owen Evans and vocalist Lisa Jàªn from Welsh outfit 9 Bach, this is an outwardly upbeat set of mostly English language songs that explores Rhys' fascination for international psychedelia, the Welsh-language music of the '60s and '70s, and the madness of the modern world.

The lyrics are found [here](http://www.candylion.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/lonesomewords.jpg). A review of the album, courtesy of The Guardian, is found [here](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1982592,00.html). More things Candylion are found [here](http://www.myspace.com/candylionmusic).

As usual, the track will be deleted in a week.

I wrote a review of what attending an **[Okkervil River](http://okkervilriver.com)** gig can feel like as Songkick asked for it, and it seems they have accepted it.

Here's my writing:

Okkervil River's back catalogue ranges between folk rock to experimental noise and lands firmly in the land of traditional rock instruments. Despite this, and having toured almost incessantly for a number of years, Okkervil manages to instil depth, hip-shaking grooves and lyrics that make you cry, scream and shout along.

I've seen them in intimate venues and on big festival stages. They've surprised me every time while providing back-breaking versions of their songs that made me reach for the skies and connect with other fans, knowing full well that our voices would give in tonight. Their stuff is diversified.

I'll say that the lyrics are worthy of your time at any given moment, and there are few artists that I feel I can say that about; and how many lyricists can you name that match Will Sheff, who write about self sacrifice, about exposing their ass, of living and loving and painting the stars with their words of pain, love and a whirlwind of emotion, paired with those guitars, the lovelorn piano, the horn, violin and the attack of the drums, and a deep, deep bass...

It's just a lovin' experience! Okkervil's a funny, meaningful band that's out for fun, for love of what they do and they truly are into what they do. See them live and you'll know.

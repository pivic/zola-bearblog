_TV-guy: Go sit in a corner! - Alex: [I'll cut you up like you did with my leg, holmes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106469/quotes?qt=qt0202008)!_

Mr. [Alexander Ruas](http://ruas.com), courtesy of [Drop Coffee](http://dropcoffee.se) fame and currently the flavour of the year as he's the (national) Swedish Barista Champion, he's soon off to compete for Sweden in the Barista World Championships!

Here's the clip with Alexander from this morning:

Best bit of banter from the show hosts:

**Person 1**: "I thought coffee was bad for you." **Person 2**: "No, it's good and healthy."

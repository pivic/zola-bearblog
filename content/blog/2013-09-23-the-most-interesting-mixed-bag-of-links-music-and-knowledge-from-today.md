**Swedish police have illegally registered Roma in Sweden**, in a database that breaks several laws. All about that [here](http://www.thelocal.se/50378/20130923). Punchline: guess who's going to investigate this? _The Swedish police_.

**Nirvana**'s "_In Utero_" - their best album, in my opinion - is now out in its 20th anniversary edition, including [a super deluxe version](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-nirvanas-rarities-packed-in-utero-reissue-20130813). All the details [here](http://www.gigwise.com/reviews/84371/nirvana---in-utero-20th-anniversary-edition), and an interview Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl is found [here](http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2013/09/09/220657501/dave-grohl-and-krist-novoselic-share-memories-unreleased-tracks-from-in-utero).

By the way, last.fm listeners seem to rule record buying in relation to Spotify and YouTube users:

And on death and finding out stuff:

> If you’ve ever watched a crime scene drama like CSI, you’ve probably asked yourself, “**Is that what really happens?**” German photographer Patrik Budenz wondered the same thing, but unlike most of us, he decided to put in the **time to find out**.
> 
> To sate his curiosity, Budenz spent months convincing the Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences in Berlin to give him full access to their facilities. For years after, he was constantly around cadavers.

Photographs from the above are found [here](http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2013/09/patrik-budenz/), and that's definitely not safe for work.

**Daft Punk** share another Spotify playlist:

It's really just piffle, but I've just created a [klip for my blog](https://niklasblog.com/niklasblog.klip), available in the right-hand frame. A klip is a little file containing the information needed to make data available in KlipFolio, a little piece of free software designed to bring news and updates to end users. More info, screen-shots and downloads are available [here](http://www.serence.com/site.php?action=ser_products,prod_klipfolio).

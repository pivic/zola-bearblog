If you wonder what I'm listening to at the moment, I'm looping [an Okkervil River playlist that X made last week](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/down-by-okkervil-river-a-tiny-playlist), and I strongly recommend it if you want to get into a really good band. Or if you're already into them, revisit and rekindle with songs that you might not have played for a while.

It feels like yesterday that X made me fall into the great Okkervil River.

_Maybe we could break your ankle clean and unsuspiciously..._

Today we bought a [Philips 32PW8609](http://www.consumer.philips.com/global/b2c/ce/catalog/product.jhtml;jsessionid=L3QHYX2TOXRLVJ0RMRCRX2FHKFSESHAW?divId=0&groupId=TV_GR&catId=WIDESCREEN_TV_CA&subCatId=29_32_WIDESCREEN_TV_SU&productId=32PW8609_12), which will be a miracle. Finally!

Rade came by after work and drove with us to Siba at Kungens Kurva, where we found the TV. It looked really great. Now there's only the part where we have to look for a bench to carry the TV, that weighs in at appx. 50 kilos. We're most likely to pick "[Bonde](http://www.ikea.se/PIAimages/31262_PE120478_S4.jpg)", which looks nice and minimalistic.

When we bought the TV, Mikela asked the seller if he couldn't chuck in a DVD in the price - sure thing! So Mikaela now has a new training DVD.

Rade and I played some [NBA 2004 Live](http://www.easports.com/games/nbalive2004/home.jsp), which is a game I really love to play. We're in the same team, and this time we were the Detroit Pistons, after Rade configured the roster to look exactly like the real team's. We missed Rasheed Wallace, but what can you do. We then moved to an advance copy of [Doom 3](http://www.doom3.com), the latest action game to hit the market. It's released today. It's a scary action game that got my computer/graphics card down on their metal knees, to pray for assistance. The game is the very latest in techs, which means it really demands stuff from computers. Actually, my computer isn't even supposed to work with the minimum specifications required of the game. It does, but everything's down low; graphics detail, no anti-aliasing, and so forth. The game has a LOT of action, and if you don't get scared by this one, you're simply not human. Or you are just one of the software engineers who made this game.

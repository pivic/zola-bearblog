**[M.I.A.](http://www.miauk.com)** is a hero. She's [fighting the NFL who are suing her for 1.5 million US Dollars for showing a finger](http://keeeb.com/pivic/on_music/52411a318e83c24d85d7ebc3/) while scantily clad cheerleaders hop about in the background. From M.I.A. herself:

> The NFL thing is completely ridiculous. It’s been making me laugh for a while, but now it’s so boring I don’t even laugh anymore. So the precise moment in question, and you can actually freeze-frame this as many media outlets have. The frame you’re looking for has my middle finger in the foreground, and the larger picture where it zooms out is a row of 10-15 cheerleaders, young black females, that Madonna got from a local high school in Indianapolis, and they were all under 16. If you look at them, they’re all wearing cheerleader outfits, hips thrusted in the air, legs wide open, in this very sexually provocative position. So, now, they’ve scapegoated me into figuring out the goalposts of what is offensive in America. Is my finger offensive, or is the underage black girl with her legs wide open more offensive to the family audience? That’s basically what it comes down to: a massive waste of time, a massive waste of money, it’s a massive display of powerful corporation dick-shaking, they want me on my knees and say sorry so they can slap me on my wrist. Basically, so they can say it’s OK for me to promote being sexually exploited as a female than to display female empowerment through being punk rock. That’s what it boils down to, and I’m being sued for it.

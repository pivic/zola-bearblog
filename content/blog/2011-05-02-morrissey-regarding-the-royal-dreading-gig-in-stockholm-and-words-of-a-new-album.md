Eloquent and on par, Morrissey delivers what I think is [the most relevant comment](http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_110501_01) regarding the wedding that recently crushed intellectuals of England:

> During the week of the royal dreading, Poly Styrene died. Having made an enormous contribution to British art and sound ““ at a desperate time when so many of us needed her, Poly Styrene's death was all but ignored by the British television news media, who instead rained hours and hours of blubbering praise onto Kate Middleton ““ a woman about whom nothing is known on a personal level. The message is clear: What you achieve in life means nothing compared to what you are born into. Is this Syria??

Of course the line "What you achieve in life means nothing compared to what you are born into" is spot on. Brilliant.

> I am delighted that the June dates sold out so quickly. Beware, we are looking at four more: Copenhagen, Aarhus, Helsingborg and Stockholm.
> 
> The follow-up to 'Years of refusal' is ready and fluttering wildly against the bars. There is still no record label and the years shuffle like cards. My talents do not lie in DIY.

Woo! New album _and_ a gig in Stockholm coming up! Even though I think "**Years Of Refusal**" may be my least loved album by Morrissey, so the prospect of a new one makes me think of "**Vauxhall & I**", which is my favourite.

I like the fact that AvantGo now neatly supports RSS-feeds. If you need to know more, click [here](https://my.avantgo.com/rss). Oh, how I long to become a machine from "[Starship Troopers](http://imdb.com/title/tt0120201)".

Further along the techstravaganza, Kerio announces it's [not going to develop its brilliant Personal Firewall](http://news.com.com/Kerio+to+scrap+desktop+firewall/2100-7350_3-5903250.html) beyond 2005-12-31. Too bad, I liked it a lot. They're ditching every firewall except on a corporate level, because they feel they cannot compete with companies that make firewalls nowadays, as they contain a lot more (e.g. anti-spy/adware functionality, antivirus software) than just a firewall.

I just read about the software [WinImage](http://winimage.com/winimage.htm). Looks very nice. Too bad it's on evaluation for 30 days, or/then 30USD. From the creator's site:

> WinImage is a fully-fledged disk-imaging suite for easy creation, reading and editing of many image formats and fileystems, including DMF, VHD, FAT, ISO, NTFS and Linux. The disk image is an exact copy of a physical disk (floppy, CD-ROM, hard disk, USB, VHD disk, etc.) or a partition that preserves the original structure. With WinImage in place, you can recreate the disk image on the hard drive or other media, view its content, extract image-based files, add new files and directories, change the format, and defragment the image.

[Microsoft says Africa doesn't need freeware](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39231004,00.htm). That's just tickety-boo. Too bad [MIT are going to unleash the effing dragon](https://niklasblog.com/?p=782) on you nughs. Blizzow!

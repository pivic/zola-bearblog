Once again - as with [this book before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=12658) - there's been a coffee-table book released, dedicated to amusing pictures of cats from everywhere. This new one's named "_[**Stink Outside the Box: Life Advice from Kitty**](http://pivic.com/catstink)_" and includes a picture of our humongous cat named [**Lotta**](https://www.flickr.com/search/?w=44124300615@N01&q=lotta), our beloved, dead Sphynx kitty.

Here's the cover of the book:

...and here's the picture of Lotta in the book, where she's erroneously been named "Blixa", which is the name of our other kitty who was featured in the mentioned book:

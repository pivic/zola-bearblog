Oh yes, Rykodisc has done us all a favour and has released "Bill Hicks: Live", a DVD of appx. 210 minutes worth of Bill Hicks. This is better than Buddah, better than Mohammad, better than Jesus and all of those combined and tossed in a pile, oh praise Buddah, Mohammad and Jesus for that! Check the details out at the Rykodisc site which is linked from here, but never the less, here's a little recap of what you might expect:

> One Night Stand from the Old Vic Theatre in Chicago (30 min) Revelations from the Dominion Theatre in London (70 min) Relentless, Bill's breakout performance at the Montreal Comedy Festival (70 min) The DVD focuses on his incredible live act, with Hicks hilariously assaulting the stage and the audience with a non-stop cornucopia of insights into our twisted world; the government, the military, the police, religion, smoking, pornography, drugs and of course, for those of you are getting antsy, a couple of dick jokes.

Go get it.

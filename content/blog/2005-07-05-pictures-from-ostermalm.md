Yesterday we headed into à–stermalm, a posh part of Stockholm, where suits and others make damn sure that having a lot of money does most definitely _not_ equal taste. Mikaela checked out new glasses at Liljeholmen, and after that we headed into town.

She bought a couple of shoes at [Fornarina](http://www.fornarina.com), where [Miss Van](http://www.missvan.com) had decorated the place, being named the stylist of the month. After that we ate good pasta at a bad restaurant; I can't remember the name of it, but it was located right next to a [Sosta](http://www.sostabar.com); that's probably the best espresso chain in Stockholm. Good espresso, very nice feel to the place and the baristas seem...authentic. That's a double-edged sword, right? _Authentic_. When I first said that to Mikaela, I wondered what it meant. I think I wanted to say that Sosta seemed really Italian - even though I've never been to Italy. That's authentic for you...

We headed on into [Gallerian](http://www.gallerian.se), where we didn't find anything really good (except for a very good Italian, _authentic_, ice-cream - I can't remember the name of the place, though), so we skipped that and headed back to [Mrs. H](http://www.mrsh.se), where Mikaela bought a very stylish, nice and expensive cardigan. The staff had this polite conversation with me, after I took a close-up picture of one of their shirts:

They: Are you taking pictures? Me: Yes, I took one picture of this delicate pattern. T: We forbid taking pictures here. M: ...Alright, I'm sorry, I won't be taking any more, and I will delete the one I took. T: \[walks away\]

There was no sign saying it was _verboten_, but hey, I'm a reasonable person. They had some really interesting designs, patterns and colours I'd love to show you, but instead I have to shove you to [their web-site](http://www.mrsh.se) which contains NO pictures of their stuff whatsoever - apart from three minimal, low-res pictures of...bags. End of story.

We went home in a daze, and plopped down for a while, and merely for a very short while, before speaking with Patrik; we agreed to meet at [Mosebacke](http://www.mosebacke.se) to have drinks. We went, and had fun; I ate a shitty dinner, but I felt I just had to eat something - while Mikaela had gin 'n' tonic plus nothing else - and we left after the air quickly became chilly. We went to a very small place on Götgatan, I can't remember its name but should Patrik read this - fill me in! The bartender was a bit cloudy-headed but made very tasty and good drinks! I'll be sure to return, should that bartender be resident.

Pictures from the day, sans from meeting Patrik and Staffan (as I, for once, left my camera at home), are found [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-07-04).

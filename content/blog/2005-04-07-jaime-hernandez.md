[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-08-locas.jpg)](http://chrisis.org/chr_ink/jaime_images/Locas.jpg)If you're into comics, you'll bump into those from [Jaime Hernandez](http://www.fantagraphics.com/artist/lr/losbros/jaime/jaime.html) (and his brother, Gilbert) sooner or later. Their comic "Love and Rockets" is one of the genre-defining moments of utter bliss, humanity and wonderous stories.

I was just reminded of "[Locas](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/156097611X)", a collection of stories about Hopey & Maggie, two of the central characters of said comic, this brick of a book is 2,3 kilograms and 700 pages of utter happiness. Order it now. Then you'll truly fall in love with their work, which is varied, rich and a bloody labour of love.

I'm sorry, but I cannot find words to express how great the Hernandez brothers are at their work. I like Gilbert's stuff, but I love just about everything Jaime pushes out. He has a unique sense of drawing, whether it's exact, stylistic, camp charicatures or abstract drawings, his images push the stories forward, and he can really write stories, as well as he draws; they're mostly surrounding every-day people living their lives. Sure, the stories are very intriguing, but just as Stanley Kubrick caught every-day scenes with masterful technique, bringing the great aspects of human life under the looking-glass, so does Jaime. So go [get "Locas" right now](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/156097611X). Remember, Kubrick once said he didn't know what he liked; he did, however, know what he didn't like. And you'll love this so shut up and cough up the money right now.

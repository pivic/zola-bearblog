That quote, by Beverly Eckert, horrified me; it's heartbreaking, visceral, and beautiful.

I read it on the way to work.

Taking steps off the tram felt like a gift.

I've not lost a beloved in so long that imagining this happening to somebody is incredible. Reading Beverly Eckert's words is shocking to me.

PS. When I review this book I'll be sure to take other factors into account, e.g. what led Al-Quaeda to 9/11 and what the effects of 9/11 were on an international level, e.g. in relation to countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, and former Yugoslavia.

I liked this film about two twin brothers, played by Edward Norton. They're very different: one grows pot in his Oklahoma home and the other wants to attain more and more academic prowess. The first concocts hare-brained get rich schemes while the other drinks tea with scholars and speaks - when he has to - about his "eccentric" family. That is, until their paths meet again.

Bill Kincaid (scholar) suddenly gets word that his brother Brady has died, and hence he returns to Oklahoma for what comes next. He's mentally not prepared to meet the rest of his estranged family, including his mother, played by Susan Sarandon. And what about his brother, anyway?

All in all, a nice film with a bunch of dark twists to it. It's one of the better I've seen where one person plays several parts without it all becoming "_Pink Panther_" - kudos to Peter Sellers' brilliant acting included - and hence leaving the audience with the sense of showmanship, but it's also neatly directed by [Tim Blake Nelson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0625789), who plays Brady's best friend and is probably most well-known for his part in "_O Brother, Where Art Thou?_".

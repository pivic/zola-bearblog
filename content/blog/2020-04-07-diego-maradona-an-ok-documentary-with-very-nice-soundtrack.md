Diego Maradona.

Swedish-state TV, SVT, now has _[Diego Maradona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona_(film))_ up and running; it's available for Swedish citizens—or, probably, also people with a rudimentary and running VPN·—you can see it [here](https://www.svtplay.se/video/26174020/diego-maradona).

That trailer includes a sped-down version of Todd Terje's track _Delorean Dynamite_, which appears to be a paean to 1980s pop music. It fucking rocks.

Back to the documentary: I've problems with the documentaries which [Asif Kapadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asif_Kapadia) have made. They're exploitative and lopsided,—as with _[Amy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_(2015_film))_—schmaltzy,—as with _[Senna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senna_(film))_—and misguided—as with _[Supersonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis:_Supersonic)_.

I don't like soccer particularly much. That's strange of me saying, considering that a huge portion of my family on my dad's side has worked in soccer for quite some time; I enjoy watching high-end matches, though, whenever I'm with somebody I hold dear and the match is engaging. It's weird to say, but I missed hearing of **the craft** throughout the documentary: I wanted to hear more from his trainers, the people around him, etc. Consider the time invested in explaining his drug use and Camorrean connections…

Yugoslavia soccer fans.

I remember seeing the soccer World Cup in 1990. My dad had kept talking about "Piksi", a.k.a. [Dragan Stojkovi?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Stojkovi%C4%87). I kept thinking, 'yeah, right', until this happened:

There are two legendary moments contained in that video:

1. [Piksi fakes a volley strike, instead acts calmly, dribbles close to the goal line, and scores](https://youtu.be/cJnPXwXrWSc?t=138)
2. [Piksi managed this free-kick](https://youtu.be/cJnPXwXrWSc?t=207)

Later in the same World Cup, both Piksi and Maradona blew their chances at scoring when the Argentina-Yugoslavia match was decided by penalty shootouts.

Yugoslavia was suddenly out of the cup.

I remember seeing my dad, sitting next to me, with his head in his hands.

On the TV was one of my uncles, sitting on the sidelines, devastated.

It felt like a dagger to the heart; it wasn't because of the game, but because my beloved father and uncle were smashed. That feeling will always be with me.

**[Antônio Pinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B4nio_Pinto_(composer))** has written quite a few soundtracks. I love how he pairs a deeply resounding bass with acoustic guitars, violins, and synths, all over an arpeggio rhythm.

Check these two examples out:

The music builds the film, not the other way around, and the film is improved because of Pinto's careful efforts.

[![Ninjaikittah](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-01-25-ninjakitten.jpg)](http://www.7secondsoflove.com)The title of this post isn't a quote, but captures the gist of the ways of a tiny company barely making a living the biggest soda-maker in the world, ergo gigantic corporation. From [this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6289933.stm) courtesy of the BBC:

> The band, 7 Seconds of Love, argued that Coke used their song Ninja and its distinctive kitten-filled video without permission in a South American advert.
> 
> After talks, Coke agreed to an out of court settlement of an undisclosed sum.

[Rule on](http://www.7secondsoflove.com)! Please, give me more shit-on-the-corporations-stuff like this, it makes my day. [Good ways](http://www.rathergood.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2862) to use the money, too.

I'd like to kick myself for doing this, but when a person comes up with such good answers to questions from all kinds of people and sticks them on the Internet, I must tip you of it. In this case, it's a very fresh [Q&A with Morrissey](http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_060221_01). To think that he's not only the most interesting pop star, but one of the more interesting political people I know of; come on, how many politicians do you know that are as staunch in their beliefs, through and through? Here are a couple of great snippets from the Q&A:

> For me personally, most album reviews tend to review me as a living entity - the actual songs or the singing or the musicianship is secondary compared to the writer's personal feelings towards .......my face. And, of course, my face rarely goes down well...

and:

> Oh, and I'd like to say thanks to all the bootleggers outside selling posters of Elvis Presley with the name Morrissey across the poster... the highlight of my life..

fawk, why not:

> I think my appeal is wide, but I'm always told by the print media that it is narrow - and of course, they should know, and I shouldn't. The audience I am trying to reach are champion figure skaters. I think they need me the most.

and, at last:

> I think it's important to lead a good life, and to try not to hurt anyone - or anything. This is difficult because we live in a world where violence seems to be the answer to everything. The courts, the police, tax officials, governments - they all rely upon the threat of violence to get their way. It's a crude world and most people are crude. All you can do is your best.

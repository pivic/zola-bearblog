[![TPC](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-07-17-tpc.jpg)](http://www.tokyopoliceclub.com "TPC") The new b-side for Tokyo Police Club's latest single, "Your English is good": TPC has revamped their site so now you can check out more info about the single and buy it [here](http://tokyopoliceclub.com/Music/your-english-is-good-single). Oh yeah, you can download the QuickTime video for "Your English Is Good" [here](http://tokyopoliceclub.com/files/yourenglish.mov). Right-click that link and pick "save as". You know how to!

Here's the track, which will be gone in a week.

Here are the lyrics, courtesy of yours truly, humble transcriber ((Who's definitely not making claims on writing in good English)):

> You know you should 'cause it's been a while and every Swede in Stockholm thinks you're in his right ((This could be "ride", but I guess "right" makes more sense.))
> 
> It is in my blood and my guilty smile in my school of thought we like to try and call it out
> 
> I won't be here for long I'm leaving in a while this could be my very last song but if I'm leaving, I am leaving in style
> 
> you go out at night in the witching hour I don't drive a car but I run pretty fast just like my dad
> 
> I didn't wear my seat-belt 'cause someone told someone else that every bounty-hunter in the world is out to get me I gotta watch my step, yeah
> 
> I won't be here for long I'm leaving in a while this could be my very last song but if I'm leaving, I am leaving in style

[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-07-08-pile.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-07-08)Yesterday Mikaela and I went to [Gömmaren](http://www.natur.huddinge.se/sjoar/gommar/gommar.htm), a little lake where the water is clear and quite un-mudded. It was fun going there in the middle of a week-day, as there weren't many people there - the water was cool yet quite warm. Mmm, terrific!

When we got home Mikaela got started on making what turned out to be [this great crumble pie](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/24467209). Her mom and dad had also prepared a lot of dishes for the evening - as we were going to sea. Mikaela's dad owns a quite large sailing-boat, so we ventured out into the Swedish archipelago where we swam in the salty sea, ate a terrific buffét and had the pie with vanilla cream.

Today I'm feeling a bit sore from all that swimming, and I'm ready to do it again. The Stockholmian weather is superb at the moment. The entire gallery from yesterday can be found [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-07-08).

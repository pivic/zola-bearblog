Having watched the first season of "[Entourage](http://www.hbo.com/entourage)", I briskly threw it (and the entire second season) into the trash; nothing really happened in the series, except for actors pretending to be actors pretending to act. Interesting?

I thought "[Seinfeld](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904)" was ahead of the game as [Larry David](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202970) resurfaced (from being rejected the fuck out of Saturday Night Live where most of his sketches were denied) with a sit-com that was based on rebuked jokes; keeping an entire 30-minute episode alive by having irritating main-characters nagging about subjects that made me flinch and think about kids dying in the third world is notable to me, at least. I mean, hearing the subjects of "Seinfeld" divide the world into trifles and petty nothings -- e.g. Jerry arguing with Elaine and George whether air is _really_ visible or not, coffee _could_ be the same as watered-down tea and if big hats are only worn by self-obsessed people (or not) -- does give you perspective on your own problems. The characters irritated the hell out of me, not only because Seinfeld said little about 99,999% of the rest of the world (which of course isn't spanking white, 30-somethinged and boring, all at the same time - much like "[Friends](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778)"), but because nothing ever really happened. Nothing.

People apparently loved that. ((A way to measure this is the following: "the show itself held the record for the Highest Television Advertising Rates through 2004" which is taken from [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld).)) In Sweden, the early nineties were defined by irony and sarcasm becoming the new cool. Little wonder did people love "Seinfeld" as it embraced the little things that many people wonder about; we butter our sandwiches before rushing off to work and think about how they always land butter-down when dropped. Consider this, then: butter a cat on its back and drop it - would that produce anti-gravity? Hm. These thoughts moulded Larry David's and Jerry Seinfeld's multi-million-dollar accounts.

I'm not against these types of TV-series. In fact, I prefer series like "Entourage" and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" when compared with crap like "[The Real World](http://www.mtv.com/onair/realworld)" or any other reality-based shit-fest that brings nothing to the table - not even a few laughs. But that's like comparing something bad with something worse.

I do, however, prefer reality-shows with something that either apply to your life in some sort of sensible, intellectual way and/or makes you learn while watching, e.g. "[Project Runway](http://www.bravotv.com/Project_Runway)" and "[Top Model](http://www.upn.com/shows/top_model)"; if you're into these professions and peel off the pap (e.g. the gossip, the rifts that the producers eagerly try and create, Tyra Banks, et.c.) you'll get professional insights which I have not witnessed in another media before. And you don't have to be an aspiring model to actually get a glimpse of the work-hard-and-you-can-make-it-mentality that douses said series. "Entourage" and the likes don't provide insights into the acting profession, though - and neither do they claim to.

My problem with most of the meta-series isn't their lack of aspiration or the fact that they are stories about stories; it is simply this: they say nothing to me about my life. Of course, I am neither an actor or a model, and I have no aspirations towards this, but remember, the stories in the semi-real series are (mostly) sheer fiction and actually, I think the stories that are entirely imagination-based are a lot more well-written. These quasi-fantastical things are mostly about trifles, shit that even I can make up. Imagine Larry David thinking up [The Log Lady](http://laura-palmer.net/pics/24.jpg). It just couldn't happen.

Think about it. In most of these meta-series, people are funny, things happen, some characters even may develop somewhat - but they seldom are even remotely memorable. Entertaining, yeah, but they're neither "[Twin Peaks](http://www.twinpeaks.org)" or "[The Wire](http://www.hbo.com/thewire)", which are merely a couple of examples of series that are entirely made-up and a lot better than any meta-adversaries.

Which, of course, lowers the expectation-level for the viewers for programs to come.

Just as language is (in parts and places) deteriorates much due to the advent of IM-software, the quality of TV-shows of today will most likely deter many script-writers-to-be from ever trying; on the other hand, this is the old things-were-better-when-I-was-younger-scenario - bollocks to that! I merely state that while some may think that things will never be better again, I say they most definitely will. Every time something gets drab, a revolution begins. History repeating, [you know](https://niklasblog.com/?p=194). Although, while "The Wire" has set a new standard for cop-series, something is severely lacking in the meta-land of TV-series, possibly "[Extras](http://imdb.com/title/tt0445114)" being the sole exception. I've heard that "[The Comeback](http://imdb.com/title/tt0434672)" is an interesting view despite Lisa Cudrow acting an ex-famous sit-com star.

What really inspired me to write this was [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEYCN3hVTYI), a bit of the pilot episode of "Nobody's Watching", a TV-show that is written by the people who made "[Scrubs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285403)" and "[Family Guy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182576)". It will be the ultimate meta-constipation yet, methinks.

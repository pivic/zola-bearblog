[![My mother's mother and an ape](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/9077324545_115e75d26e_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/9077324545/)

The above picture was taken some time in the 1980s, while my grandmother was on vacation in Spain, unless I'm sorely mistaken.

I miss her. She had immense amounts of humor; well, the picture is kind of a giveaway at that.

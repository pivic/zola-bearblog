Back in the day when I was making presentations to show _regular people_ how accessible IT can be, I made this little presentation (wholly in English) instead of using something like [PowerPoint Producer](http://blogs.msdn.com/powerpoint/archive/2010/05/07/producer-for-powerpoint-now-official.aspx) ((Now available for PowerPoint 2010.)); I strongly recommend giving [Prezi](http://prezi.com) a spin. It's easy to use and is very efficient at getting the point across when you're trying to illustrate something complex.

I think Microsoft are copying Prezi a little as they've come up with a PowerPoint add-in called [pptPlex](http://www.officelabs.com/projects/pptPlex/Pages/default.aspx) which imitates Prezi fairly well.

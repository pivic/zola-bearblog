This year, as [Jarvis Cocker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis%20Cocker) would put it, something changed.

Being one of the best cafés in Stockholm, [Drop Coffee](http://dropcoffee.se) has expanded its territory by roasting the coffees they import, brew and sell. Wholesale, even, through their [web shop](https://dropcoffee.my123eshop.com).

This coffee is entirely traceable, sustainable and bought from local coffee-farmers.

Yesterday the final leg of [The Swedish Barista Championships 2011](http://www.scae.se/content.php?page=Barista%20Cup) was held. While three out of three contestants from Drop Coffee made it to the semifinals, [Oskar](http://www.flickr.com/photos/coffeeruas/5433231205/) and [Alexander](http://ruas.com) made it to the finals, where Alexander won the title of **Barista of the Year**.

The judges' motivation:

> The winner is a very passionate Barista that knows and loves his coffee. This Barista was technically the best of all competitors, like a Swedish machine. I can not find another brand that can represent Sweden better than Volvo, except for the winner.

So, without further ado: many congratulations to Alexander for winning, and to Oskar and [Erik](http://www.flickr.com/photos/coffeeruas/3795435522/) for choosing, importing and roasting the winning coffees that they used while competing, Drop Coffee Panama!

I know these guys and I strongly recommend a visit or fifty to their café on [Wollmar Yxkullgatan 10](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=59.3169323%2C18.0626788&hl=en&z=16&ie=UTF8). They've worked so hard on that place, continually improving, renovating and re-thinking, and the same goes even more for their coffees.

If you're a roaster, I recommend keeping a watch on these guys even more than the regular punter as they're preparing to unleash what might mean a small revolution, in a technological sense.

Keep an eye out for them on their own [blog](http://dropcoffee.blogspot.com), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/dropcoffee) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dropcoffee).

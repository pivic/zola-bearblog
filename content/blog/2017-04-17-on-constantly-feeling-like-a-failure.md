The above is from a long interview with the author Walter Mosley from The Paris Review. The interviewer first asked him whether he wrote to impress his parents. No, he was too old for that, he said, as he was 38-39 years old when he attained some kind of success. He then said what's in the text above.

I just think of how I love his "And I'm important? Motherfucker, you are not important."

Mosley creates and doesn't think his shit is to be set in stone. It's like Ramones' music, to me: it may be bubblegum music, but it may change worlds.

Gotta remember that: rather do, than compare, or fear failure.

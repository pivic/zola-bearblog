Before you ask: _well, why not?_

As my colleagues have travelled abroad I've been left to an office of 3-6 other people in total, where there usually are appx. 100 people, I'd wager. So, in light of this, I had lunch quickly and went on a selfie mission:

What would I look like if I were found dead in the office?

Most meeting rooms are dreadfully simple and plain. Hence, I decided to spruce things up with my corpse, as it were. The cause of death would differ, but I first thought of death by asphyxiation, being shot in the chest, getting knifed and placed in a window, or why could I not just have died from some "natural" cause?

Anyway, I hope you like them.

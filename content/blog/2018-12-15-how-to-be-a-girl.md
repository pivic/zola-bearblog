After [I had recently asked for podcasts to listen to](https://niklasblog.com/?p=22136), my friend Katze alerted myself of the existence of "**[How To Be A Girl](http://www.howtobeagirlpodcast.com)**", a podcast that is made by the parent of a transgender child. This video, made by the parent, is probably best at explaining the series:

I quickly devoured half of the series. While listening, there were so many times that I anguished, cried, and found myself confronting my own prejudice, that this podcast quickly floated to become one of my favourites.

The kid herself is phenomenal; if I had half of her intelligence and empathy, I'd be a better person than I am. I'm not extrapolating or exaggerating by writing that.

How girlie do you have to be to secure your spot in the girl club?  And what happens when your own mother questions your girl credentials?

Also, [this episode was wondrous](http://www.howtobeagirlpodcast.com/episodes/episode-xx-the-betrayal), especially in terms of being able to forgive each other. I could give loads of examples of thoughtworthy and exemplary bits throughout the series, and I won't.

I strongly advise you to check the podcast out and see how your own world stacks up after having heard a few episodes. This shit is contagious in a great way.

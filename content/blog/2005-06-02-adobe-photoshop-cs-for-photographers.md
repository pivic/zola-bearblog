While having a coffee with Andreas a few days ago, he whipped out a magazine titelled "Black & White Photography". In [the latest issue](http://www.thegmcgroup.com/item--Black-White-issue-046-May-05--BW-046-055.html), there was a portfolio article on [Tony Mendoza's grand pictures of Ernie](http://accad.osu.edu/~tmendoza), his flat-mate's cat. Tony snapped over 10000 negatives of Ernie over a two-year period, resulting in a photo-book which I have now ordered at [a very reasonable price](http://www.thebookplace.co.uk/bookplace/display.asp?CID=BOK439&ISB=0811829634).

Reading the beforementioned magazine this evening, a leaflet fell out, advertising books on photography. My eye quicky recognised [Martin Evening](http://www.martinevening.com)'s "Adobe Photoshop CS For Photographers", and got me thinking. Has the latest edition been printed yet? Sure enough.

Imagine my surprise when I scoured the best Swedish online cheapest-book-finders, [Bokfynd](http://www.bokfynd.nu) and [Prispallen](http://www.prispallen.se), checked them out thoroughly and found they not only displayed different prices, but also somewhat different suppliers. I'm not shocked by this fact, but it's drab none the less: these book-pimps are allied with a number of retailers. Should the cheapest and best retailer in the world not be allied with them, well, their books aren't very likely to show up in the Bokfynd/Prispallen roundabout. This is, of course, not limited to these two mentioned online advisors. They've got to make a living too, right? Still, I'm guessing a naughty (read: brilliant) programmer will (hopefully soon) plod along and create a web page that works without sponsors, i.e. not skewing the results according to cash-flow, but merely displaying the truth.

So, what happened? While hunting, I entered the online site of Akademibokhandeln where I could quickly see that the book is in stock, isn't expensive at all, and can probably be picked up tomorrow! Weee! [Here](http://www.akademibokhandeln.se/db/caweb/cc_artikel.visa_artikelkort?cartikel_id=5037355)'s the link to it at Akademibokhandeln, and for all of you living abroad, [here](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0240519841)'s the cheapest place I could find for you.

I love the predecessor to this edition of the book I've ordered, which I've loaned off \[avatar:/bilder/avatars/staffan.gif\]Staffan\[/avatar\]. The book still comes with a CD-R packed with demo films and pictures, making it easy to follow the leader. If you're interested in the book, read more about it [here](http://www.photoshopforphotographers.com/pscs2/index2.htm).

Now to bed. Tomorrow afternoon I'm meeting an English specialist in an area where I am most definitely not a specialist. I hope the person who's summoned me to this meeting knows what he's doing.

**update**: now that [MS says it's adding RAW support to Longhorn](http://news.com.com/Longhorn+to+get+raw+image+support/2100-1016_3-5727545.html), I guess the format's here to stay. Now, I'd only wish for Nikon to get a grip on reality and say they're letting go of [the NEF file white balance encryption business](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000960042753/).

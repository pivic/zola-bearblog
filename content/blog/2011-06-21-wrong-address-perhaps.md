For a long time, I've been receiving e-mail that's intended for another e-mail domain, as disclosed [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5333) and [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5759), for example. Because of human error.

Today's a first! Somebody's entered the wrong e-mail address when placing their order for something, which is grooming products!

A screenshot from my mailbox with some fields blurred to protect the guilty:

I've been nice, I promise. I've e-mailed the intended recipient - who's been nothing but mean to me - and informed him of this. Let's see if he answers. Even if he doesn't, I'm sure he'll soon enough be enjoying a DELUXE MICRO TOUCH shave.

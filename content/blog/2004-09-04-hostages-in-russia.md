![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-09-04-russia.jpg)According to recent sources, the number of dead humans amount to 250, yet that number will probably rise in the days to come. The BBC have a [chronological timeline](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3624136.stm) on the event, how it unfurled. They also report on "[restrained coverage](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3624716.stm)".

Either Russian authorities have no negotiating powers, or the hostage-takers went insane. Hopefully, if smoke clears regarding this incident, I hope Russian authorities are not to blame, as when they [killed more civilians than hostage-takers](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2368077.stm) a couple of years ago, at the siege of a Moscow theatre.

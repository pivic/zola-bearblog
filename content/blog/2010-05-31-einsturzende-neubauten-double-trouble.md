They're coming into my town. Finally, again. X and I will get to see them! The last time we missed out after a couple of songs [due to exhaustion/overheating issues](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1461), but this time I must fare better!

From [their site](http://neubauten.org):

> The Berlin band has been an integral part of the international music scene for 30 years.
> 
> In 2010 their stage anniversary will be celebrated with a tour through Europe and the United States.
> 
> Concerts will be held in selected cities, but also at locations that are significant to the band.
> 
> And it'll be more than just a single concert event during the anniversary tour. The band is planning to make a guest performance on an additional day, presenting the audience with a mixed program of the [Einstürzende Neubauten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einst%C3%BCrzende%20Neubauten), films, solo shows, guests and friends.
> 
> More specifically, the band will play a great concert on the first night, while the second night will be divided into 3-part program.
> 
> It'll begin with films and installations. Afterwards the band will play a further, but much shorter concert in which the Neubauten will present material that has never been played live, hasn't been played live for a long time, or never in this form.
> 
> The evening will be rounded off with shows and performances by the individual Einstürzende Neubauten members, recomposed from city to city:

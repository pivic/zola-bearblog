[En dramatikers dagbok](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6147067) by [Lars Norén](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/901619)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1015459447)  
  
At first, I thought I'd never get through this book. That's before I actually opened it. But when digging into it, reading it all took me three days, which says something about how quickly this tome is read. The sentences are short, the language simple and not too staged. Even if one hates Norén and his ways, you can dig this. I mean, he doesn't paint a picture, but uses simple words that anybody can understand, and describes the purchase of a jacket and his crumbling marriage in about the same way. All in all: an interesting, not very pretentious delve into the mind of Norén, and if I were to describe the style of this, I'd say it's a mixture of [Bodil Malmsten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodil_Malmsten), [Montaigne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne) and [Kenneth Williams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Williams).

Today, I received [the deluxe version of Morrissey's "You Are The Quarry"](http://stores.musictoday.com/store/product.asp?dept_id=5688&pf_id=6SCD0776&band_id=817&sfid=7). It makes you think, if you're a The Smiths/Moz fan, right? I mean, "[Re-issue ! Re-package ! Re-package !](http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/PAINT-A-VULGAR-PICTURE-lyrics-The-Smiths/2B26EAB9B811E770482568AB002A24B2)", and that from a man who's re-issued his latest album six months after its original release, sporting a "_Acclaimed new album as a TWO CD set which includes: **THREE TOP 10 SINGLES**_" badge, yet that's lacking the fourth, last single off the album. That's cheap and feels strange! I got it for the live cuts (even though I've got them since ages, courtesy of [Mrs. Shankly](http://www.mrsshankly.com)), the photo gallery and the sake of having _almost all the singles_ off this album on CD.

I've been lasting this day due to music. All types of things have happened recently. Yesterday, when I thought the migration of a database went smoothly \[bear with me, these days have been nothing but tech, so I have to write this down to get it out of my system\], a supplier had done his work without problems - it turned out I had to trouble-shoot and then recreate an SQL replication. Well, this was no real problem, except that it's pretty hard to delete the old subscription, especially as I was supposed to spend that time taking our lists on database files, compile statistics, try and collect information for a project, act a nanny for a couple of persons who don't know how to do their jobs properly, and...gah. It was a horrible morning, even though I did get a lof of things done. I was helped by [EC8OR](http://www.forcedexposure.com/artists/ec8or.html), a group that was on the Digital Hardcore Recordings label, before splitting up. They were a very hardcore gabber/breakbeat group, funky though! Reminds me of the old Kraftwerk/Leonard story. Leonard went to Düsseldorf to produce what would become Kraftwerk's "The Man Machine"/"Die Mench Machine", and for an hour, the group couldn't find the producer and he couldn't find the band. They were in the same hall though, and eventually found each-other. The reason for the delay? He thought they'd be black and they thought he'd be white. Funkiness comes in all colours. Anyway, on EC8OR: I recently got hold of their three albums which are all interesting, even though I think their first one is the best. "I Don't Wanna Be A Part Of This" is an extremely good track, find it if you can. I first heard it off an Alec Empire-compiled collection called "Riot Sounds", which also contains a lot of good stuff from Atari Teenage Riot, Shizuo, Christoph de Babalon and DJ Mowgly.

Jesper came up to work to give me the gloves I've been missing since Marie's and his party, so I got those in exchange for a billion US dollars. That's what he wanted, anyway. I said I'd give him Paul Wolfowitz, and nothing more. Jesper didn't want him.

While reading [Public Service](http://www.publicservice.nu), I became interested in [The Yes Men](http://www.theyesmen.org), a group of people committed to using "funhouse mirrors" to showing politicians how upside-down their ideas and ideals are. Check their web site, for an FAQ, info on their documentary that's really good (called "[The Yes Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379593)") and info on their "pranks". For an example, check [this case](http://www.theyesmen.org/hijinks/wto.shtml). That documentary rocks. It's great watching a couple of people ripping the WTO, McDonalds, pro-globalising (and an _anti-globalising_) jackasses to pieces.

I'm a little tired, so I'll drink a little wine and just watch a clip of Samantha Bee killing film critics on The Daily Show.

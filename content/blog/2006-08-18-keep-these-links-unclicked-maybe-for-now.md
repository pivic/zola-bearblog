[![PPT does *not* rule.](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-08-18-ppt-tattoo.jpg)](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/03/28/tattooed-powerpoint-girls-are-cute)Thanks to [Warren Ellis](http://www.warrenellis.com), I've found [ModBlog](http://modblog.bmezine.com), a site where piercing, tattoos and other forms of body-altering is documented in pictures. Now, a word of warning again: the links in this post are mostly not work-safe, but I will notify when they are.

The first post I found was [this one](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/08/16/her-little-demon), making me gasp and say "God, why?" for the first of many times this evening. Reminded me of [this one](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/12/04/i-heart-pussy-tattoos).

The links in this paragraph are work-safe: [this unexplainable tattoo](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/03/28/tattooed-powerpoint-girls-are-cute) made me laugh, and it's very after-Office-2000-and-before-Office-2007. Speaking of which, having the touch to wade past a bunch of [awful hearty pictures](http://modblog.bmezine.com/wp-content/uploads/200601182109-pix6.jpg), [this](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/03/10/bryan-adams-tattoo) scared the hell out of me. Bryan effing Adams. Or somebody having [this](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/07/19/girls-best-friend-outline) done, which is quite insane. While on the way to GTD, [this](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/03/29/to-do-note-tattoo) may be a welcome alternative. While waiting for my MacBook to get ready, I am getting a load of [this tattoo](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/12/12/death-to-apple). How very true, in a destructive sense. I really like [cute satanism](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/07/27/so-cute-yet-so-evil), it's kind of a way [to not grow up](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/04/12/no-modblog-today-but) (like most religions lean towards), a tad [Clockwork Orangeish](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/04/26/o-my-brothers-a-clockwork-orange-tattoo), or getting a picture of [your biggest interest](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/06/06/i-can-guess-what-you-do), and [this fantastic tattoo of a Sphynx](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/06/30/hairless-cat-tattoo) is just wonderful. Speaking of cats, get [this cut kitty](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/01/15/kitty-cat-cutting). And if you have really, really caring people around you, youget convinced to have the [type and weight of a medicine](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/06/22/medic-alert-tattoo) you need not to die, just in case you have a seizure. A couple more like that one are found [here](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/12/21/medical-tattoos). And [Cute Overload](http://www.cuteoverload.com) would probably not showcase [this tattoo](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/07/04/teddybear-suicide-tattoo). Speaking of self-mutilation, there's something about [this tattoo](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/02/20/luke-chueh-tattoo) that makes me smile. How about bad language, especially when people dabble in something [swanky like...kanji](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/09/20/more-kanji-tattoo-mistakes)? More [here](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/09/10/bad-kanji-tattoos). Speaking of idiots, we have my #1 favourite idiot [right here](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/08/07/tattooed-crooks). And [an Eames-chair](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/02/14/eames-rar-tattoo), coupled with [a knuckle-sandwich](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/02/11/knuckle-sandwich) that should be offered to people who pick [awful nick-names](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/08/28/whats-cooler-than-being-cool) (and pay to have them printed over their entire upper body). And [what when you've bought](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/02/06/nintendo-gameboy-tattoo) a Nintendo DS, what then? Gotta love somebody for having [Dead Prez on his back](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/01/27/bob-marley-trench-town-rock), and somebody else for [loving kimchi](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/01/22/insert-kimchi-here). And for once, and I do mean _once_ - as I have sifted through more than 55 pages of stuff at said site - has a [tattoo turned out better than the photograph](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/02/01/woof-woof-dog-portrait-tattoo) meant to guide a tattooist. And I must say I love the [foot-tattoos](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/12/14/robots-in-love-or-at-least-one-of-them); those people seem to have their stuff together. If I get a tattoo, I swear I will think it through first, unlike [some](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/01/14/a-few-more-geeky-tattoos). And [simple](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/12/03/silly-tattoo) may be best.

The following are not work-or-anything-safe: [an ass-eagle](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/04/11/eagle-ass-tattoo) scared the hell out of me, but not nearly as much as [this film](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/06/20/bme-video-trailer-4) actually did. Takes all sorts, et.c., like the people who [burn their genitals](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/06/20/genital-cigarette-burns). Or having [extra holes](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/07/24/giant-nostrils-and-septum-jewelry-removed/) in your nose. There are a lot of [split tongues](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/01/28/tongue-splitting-tongue-v-tongue) (yeah, [loads](http://modblog.bmezine.com/wp-content/uploads/200512240816-pix1.jpg)) and [girls wearing inter-twined string](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/01/15/lucky-bastard) at the site. [Battle Amanda Lepore](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/12/10/beat-that-mick-jagger), or [use your lips to gold-dig](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/12/03/she-take-my-money-when-im-in-need). The infections [aren't forgotten](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/01/14/cartilage-infection), by the way; neither is [the answer](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/12/25/dont-try-this-at-home) to "does crabs eat human flesh?". They probably eat [flying tampons](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/09/24/flying-tampon) (made in Sweden). And if you regret a tattoo, [just remove it](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2006/01/31/hardcore-tattoo-removal), simple...or maybe prefer dying. And never remove your eventual [Pacman ass-tattoo](http://modblog.bmezine.com/2005/11/21/pacman-maze-ass).

It's another video from beloved Overkill Dribble, this time featuring old family footage of Will Sheff as a blast.

[![Will Sheff, aged 25. Or 5.](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2011-09-29_1709_000.png "Will Sheff, aged 25. Or 5.")](https://niklasblog.com/?attachment_id=8370)

Amidst armadillos - or what's the plural on those things, armadillii? - baseball, cartwheels and Thurston Moore-poses, the pictures are family-sweet, but I unfortunately the track isn't a fave of mine, but the imagery does make it better.

Below's the video, and beyond that it's all screenshots. They remind me of a lyric by Destroyer: _all seems like a dream to me_.

Google's very own web browser, Chrome, is out.

Get it for Windows [here](http://www.google.com/chrome), and read all about it [here](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome), as presented by Scott McCloud.

My fave points: the memory handling, the speed dial home page (as purloined from Opera), the stuffs supposedly keeping you safe from malware and phishing, the UI, it's open source, I love the testing done, there are web application shortcuts, the webkit rendering engine is new and fresh and the V8 javascript virtualisation machine helps developers and create platform independence with ways to purge memory; quite a lot of features here!

I so far love the general feel of it; I find it's quite light-weight, and with that I mean it's light. Not stumpy. Pages load quickly and opening a bunch of tabs doesn't make it sluggish. So far, so good!

**edit**: of course, there's a caveat for Chrome; check the details [here](http://www.download.com/8301-2007_4-10030522-12.html), and here's the bit I found most interesting, straight outta the Chrome terms of service:

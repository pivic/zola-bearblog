Techcrunch has just posted [this article](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch?m=740) that contains an interesting matrix of web-based feed-readers. Until recently, I used [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com); the problem was, that a lot of other users also did just that, and it didn't update the feeds often enough, for me. Weirdly, some feeds were updated an entire day after they were really posted (in the RSS-feed). So I've been using [Reblog](http://www.reblog.org) for the past two weeks, which I first described [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=912). It's still good, but I'd like to have a quick-key available to unread all items from one particular feed. In defense of Bloglines, I now detect a lot more duplicate posts - no fault of Reblog, I assure you - because some RSS-feeds tend to be reinitialised, which means I have to read all of the feeds over again, unless I archive the entire feed. Luckily, marking individual posts as read is extremely easy in Reblog, due to the AJAX-feature-enabled quick-keys.

Peter tipped me about [this streamable speech by Dick Hardt](http://identity20.com/media/ETECH_2006), which is all about how user-identities should be communicated across the web. Very interesting, considering we would all like easier ways to manage all our different identities over the web.

Imagine this: you're an Australian junkie. Hence, you try to fence something. How about...a koala? They try, and get "scratched to shit". What do they try then? [Read on](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/03/30/dumb_aussie_junkies_.html).

You want to try Linux without installing or running a "live CD" (which enables you to boot a Linux-OS and run it without installing it, but this process slows everything down as every single component and the entire OS is run from your hard-drive)? Try [HP's TestDrive](http://osdir.com/Article8487.phtml). You have to register for it, but it seems worth it, if you want to run Linux from HP's 64-bit processors.

Depeche Mode will reissue [their old albums, remastered](http://remasters.depechemode.com), in April. Sweet.

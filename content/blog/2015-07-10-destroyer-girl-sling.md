If there's justice in this world, this video deserves a billion plays. [**Destroyer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer_(band)) Dan is en route with his new album, "_Poison Season_", which is dropping late August. [Get it from Merge](https://www.mergerecords.com/poison-season).

I like director David Galloway's words on the video below here, snatched from [this Stereogum article](http://www.stereogum.com/1814069/destroyer-girl-in-a-sling-video/mp3s/):

> Bejar sings a lot about cities and girls and injury, sometimes all at the same time. Sometimes they are the same thing, as surreal novelists would have us believe. Besides, people like to see Dan sing — which he doesn’t do a lot of in this video, but he does do a little bit. We wanted to make a video that dealt with central Destroyer themes: to some, Destroyer is a lech; to some, he is an arsonist; to some, he is a savior. To me, he is the consummate comedian, but he resists that role. So we decided to go the opposite way and make something sad, something tragic, something that fits the new record. The adage “comedy equals tragedy plus time” is attributed to Carol Burnett’s mum. Or it might have been Steve Allen. Either way, I always want Dan to do physical comedy, but he resists. He’s a natural, though. He’s the Pacific Northwest’s Buster Keaton, and I hope one day to share that with the world. One day. For now, though, there’s just this sadness. This poison season.

[This is a link](http://www.epub.org.br/cm/gallery/gall_leonardo/fig1-a.htm) to a page where a number of images have been posted, to illustrate a painter's decline into a psychotic state. He drew cats posing as humans, most of the time, and then became schizophrenic, and painted some of the most lovely cat pictures I have ever seen.

Speaking of lucid imagery, I must recommend the newly opened [Warp Films](http://www.warpfilms.com) site, where one can (among other things) read on Chris Cunningham's coming short-film, “Rubber Johnny", to which Aphex Twin has composed the music.

Waiting for Keanu Reeves to screw up the lead in “[Constantine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/combined)“ \[the trailer is available [here](http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/constantine)\], I continue to read the comic on which the coming film is more than based, and urge you to do [the same](http://zzt.the-underdogs.org/james/hellblazer/thefrickinissues.html).

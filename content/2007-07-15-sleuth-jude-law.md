A while back ago I saw "[Sleuth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069281)", a film starring Michael Caine and Lawrence Olivier. Now I find that [it's remade](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0857265), starring Jude Law and Michael Caine, and Harold Pinter's written the screenplay (according to iMDB). In the old version, Caine acts the young man and Olivier the old, and now Caine steps up and lets Law renew another of his old roles; he did that in "[Alfie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375173)".

If you haven't seen the original "Sleuth", go and rectify this at once! Don't read too much about it, it's really good, leave it at that. Olivier and Caine play nearly the only roles in that entire film, which is based on a very successful play. Anyway, those two brilliant actors in the same film...I hope Caine/Law are as successful in setting it up!

Another wicked thing: Law might be set to play Ozymandias in [the filmed version](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409459) of Alan Moore's magnum opus "[Watchmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen)".

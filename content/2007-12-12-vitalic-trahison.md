![Vitalic](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-12-12-vitalic.jpg)When I first heard [Vitalic](http://www.vitalic.citizen-records.com), I thought he sounded like [Giorgio Moroder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Moroder) crossing into the 21st century. Not that there's anything that really sounds modern in Vitalic's synths, but his sense for composing and creating cold, classical melodies - quite reminiscent of [Vangelis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vangelis)' soundtrack to "Blade Runner" - bundled with a [Kraftwerk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk)\-esque danceability has turned him into one of the poster-children for modern dance-music using old gear.

The best example of what elates his music far above many others' is (in my mind) the track "[Trahison](http://www.zshare.net/audio/551161021b7916/)"; check it out, and try it twice if it doesn't stick the first time around. I don't know how many times I've heard it, and I love it both in headphones and on the dance-floor. The track is taken off his massive - and so far only - album "[OK Cowboy](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/v/vitalic/ok-cowboy.shtml)".

Here are a couple of his tracks on video slapped on for displaying his breadth: "Poney Part 1" is mostly known for the video, and "Poney Part 2" is a better track, albeit thrown in here merely for the music; the video is fan-made.

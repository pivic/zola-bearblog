The Peckish Pap Risen. As though “[Battle Royale](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266308)“ had never been made, this is more a bored, non-thinking, single-serving bastardised version of what film should be. You deserve being treated as a thinking human being. This does not. It's the worst of knee-jerking blended with use of good digital cameras. May [Stanley Tucci](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001804) evolve in his grave. See “[Battle Royale](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266308)“ and stop wondering why you constantly side-track this piece-of-pap film. This is a dance around The God of Philistines. There are few thinking offerings. There are no really thought-worthy options. No scenes with mind-bending scenes that make you want to vomit, even. Instead, I found myself thinking I wanted them all to die. No favourites, no excuses, just die. This is just money-making at its lowest level, not even worthy of a really bad hangover.

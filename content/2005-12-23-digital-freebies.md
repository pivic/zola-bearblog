One and all, here there be free gifts! Music and apps!

James Zabiela likes to share his promo house/trance/techno-mixes made this autumn, so [here](http://homepage.mac.com/jameszabiela/FOUR.2/FileSharing25.html) they are. Should you be nerdy enough to know what a CUE-file is, you can find them for said mixes right [here](http://www.djsource.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=47415).

Should you desire to download some films - do it [here](http://publicdomaintorrents.com)! It's completely legal, and even though the films are old and some may think that's what makes them boring - you idiots - among them you'll find "[Plan 9 From Outer Space](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052077)" (often referred to as the "worst movie ever" and it could be, but it's terrific fun to watch) and "[Metropolis](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017136)" (currently #74 on [the top 250 list](http://www.imdb.com/top_250_films) at IMDb).

[Unlocker](http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker) is the best program (for Windows) that I've found in a long time. Sadly, that web page is crippled when running it in Mozilla Firefox, but please, use IE to download and install it. What it does? It works miracles whenever you need to delete folders or files that Windows won't let you remove. See [this error message](http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/example.png) and you'll know what I'm talking about.

My fave app of 2005? [Password Agent](http://www.moonsoftware.com/pwagent.asp), hands down. It lets you save your passwords onto, say, a USB memory key, encrypted in 256-bits. It's got a lot more to it than that, so go get. I've written more about it [before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=786).

And yet again, [I let a Savage Chicken, this time with Santa, tell you about xmas](http://www.savagechickens.com/blog/2005/12/christmas-blues.html).

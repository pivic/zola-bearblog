![Free Mojtaba and Arash day](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v501/QueenofSky/freemojtabaarashday-smallba.gif)

Today's a day which is for contemplating what expressing one's thoughts really means. Of course this should be clear in a fundamental way from the start: if you ask me, censorship is a bad thing. People have different ideas about this, yet I think most people back this idea. Arash Sigarchi and Mojtaba Saminejad are both in prison in Iran, as they have expressed their opinions using their respective blogs. On this campaign, from [Iz Reloaded](http://izreloaded.tripod.com/february2005.htm#freemojtabaandarash):

> The Committee to Protect Bloggers was created a month ago by Curt, Ellen Simonetti, Bill Crawford, Andrew Nachison and Rebecca MacKinnon. Curt explained why he formed it, "I saw a New York Times article on reformist cleric Mohammad Ali Abtahi, a prominent blogger, and his work for imprisoned bloggers. I realized bloggers are sort of without official status, so I thought we bloggers could work together." According to Curt, the committee consists of every blogger in the world, theoretically. But they are three staff and four advisors. "We have Texans, Oregonians, Canadian-Iranians, Syrian people. We even heard from people from Brazil to Japan to Malaysia to France," said Curt.

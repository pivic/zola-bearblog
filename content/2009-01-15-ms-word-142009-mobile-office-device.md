As screenshots from the recently released alpha build of Microsoft Office 14 (which will probably be named Microsoft Office 2009) have emerged, something really interesting has come across, namely _Mobile Office Device_. It seems to create a portable version of an MS Office application - in this case Word - to be stored and run from a USB memory-stick.

In October 2008 Microsoft revealed that they are readying [a crippled version of MS Office for online use](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2008323812_microsoftpdcside29.html), to be released at the same time as Office 14. I doubt that they're going to let the online suite be available for offline use, so maybe the Mobile Office Device can be seen as a way to use MS Office offline, without having to install the suite per computer? I wonder what this means license-wise.

Additionally, will they be able to knock [OpenOffice.org Portable](http://portableapps.com/apps/office/openoffice_portable) from the portable office-suite throne?

Here's a video of a screenshot that I filmed while drawling and regurgitating slightly more about the matter.

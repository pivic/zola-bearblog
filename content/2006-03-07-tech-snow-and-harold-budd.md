[This gallery](http://www.bubbleshare.com/album/16407.eb0d60b0627) was made using [BubbleShare](http://www.bubbleshare.com), a free service much like [flickr](http://flickr.com), but with a few interesting features flickr doesn't have. Enabling a person to download all the pictures in a gallery as a ZIP-file is pretty nifty (and already exists in [Gallery](http://gallery.sourceforge.net), a freeware photo service). Take a look if you need to share a few pictures. You don't even have to enable an account to upload, administer and share a gallery.

[Blinkx](http://www.blinkx.com/overview.php) has released a 4MB search-tool for Windows that's [quite interesting](http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-6046537.html). Once installed, it sits on the top-right side of the screen. Then, whatever you do - surf a web page, reads your "active screen" and lets you search that data through some different categories. Check [this little visual tour](http://www.blinkx.com/pico.html) and you'll get the hang very quickly.

By no way, it's now -15 degrees Celsius in Stockholm, but we're holding up. [The lions are](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=147&a=526857)! That didn't prevent me from going to [Pet Sounds](http://www.petsounds.se/web/) and getting [Harold Budd](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kxk0ikz6bb89)'s "[Avalon Sutra/As Long As I Can Hold My Breath](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:bkevad1kw8wj)", a magnificent, stunning work of art.

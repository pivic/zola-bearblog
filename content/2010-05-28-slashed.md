OK, so [Ash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash%20%28band%29) are making their old horror flick "_Slashed_" available to the general populace, which means you can now see part 1 of said flick off YouTube!

It's a few years down the road - [Charlotte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte%20Hatherley)'s still in the band - and it's supported by [Chris Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris%20Martin) and another somebody from [Coldplay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldplay).

Funny horror does rock indeed.

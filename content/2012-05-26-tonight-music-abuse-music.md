Listening to [**Santigold**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santigold)'s new album "**Master Of My Make-Believe**" which is enough to laugh in the face of artists like Vampire Weekend (since long forgotten, thank you all).

So, while the upstairs neighbour is playing the Eurovision Song Contest at the very loudest, I'm just going with the flow. Chatting with friends on Facebook while trying to come into some kind of "I really want to see '_The Rum Diary_' mood" is an illusion.

I'm going from Santigold to the track that **Beastie Boys** recorded with her - "_Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win_":

Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win by [Beastie Boys](http://grooveshark.com/artist/Beastie+Boys/2988 "Beastie Boys") on Grooveshark

I'm coming to terms with the fact that MCA is dead. I saw something that Ad-Rock posted on the Beastie Boys blog about them attending "MCA DAY" which a fan started. I'm glad that helped not only Ad-Rock and Mike D (I wrote "the Beasties" first, but deleted it) but the others who were there.

It's strange. I recently met a guy in the flesh for the first time ever. We've been communicating through different places on the Internet for years, and now, hey, we met. He wasn't a spaz. Au contraire, he was really nice, intelligent and funny. So, while talking about music he asked me which my fave artists were. And mentioning the Beastie Boys didn't even break a tear; believe me, it's taken since MCA's death until recently, to hear them and not feel sad. I first felt the change when I realised he is going to be the cover-person for coming edition of The Rolling Stone magazine.

Speaking of people, the Swedish edition of **Big Brother** has yielded something other than exhibitionism.

One contestant, Annica Englund, seems to be infatuated with another, named Marcelo Peà±a. While she wants to be with him all the time, he seems to want the same, until you (as a viewer) realises he's merely constantly abusing her mentally. It's all caught on film. It's not even a question of whether he really is using and abusing her - it's evident and on display for all to see. Apart from his on-camera infidelity (with another girl), the things he does to the girl whom he claims to love are heart-breaking. For example, today I saw him sitting alone with Annica and while she told him something sweet, he casually mentioned that his relationship with her was simply fleeting and that he might break up with her in some way as the contest would end. While she reacted to this by crying, he laughed and told her that he was only joking.

That behaviour has been repeated over and over, whether or not people are around. And Peà±a has continually been admitting to treating her badly. "I don't know why."

One minute he's "nice", and the second he's horrible. Well, while it's easy to say it's her life to deal with, that's a fucked-up statement. When he gets out of there, I personally hope the footage lives on to sufficiently haunt him and also to remind him of what he's done. And I do hope he gets better, unless he's a psychopathic person, which - deeming from what I've seen - seems tangible.

In [his character interview at the Big Brother site](http://www.bigbrother.se/1.2546277/2012/02/23/marcelo_pena), he's asked how he'll win the contest. "By being myself and by being funny." So, he's either being himself or being funny. On the same page, he answers the question "What would you not do?" with "To kiss a man." So, that's the only thing he would not do. There are a lot more interesting Q&A with him, the young 'un. Lost at sea.

Listening to the **Suede** remasters is a different thing. It's being replenished. From tracks like the unedited version of "_The Asphalt World_", clocking in at 11:27, songs like "_This World Needs A Father_" to the insane synth on the demo of "_The Power_" (called "_Banana Youth_") are fine additions.

As the night winds down, the **Eurovision Song Contest** does as well. And a very gracious winner it was, too. The singer's response to the question "Why do you think the viewer's voted for you?" was, after a short intro, "I don't wear make-up, I'm bare-footed and I think a lot of people can recognise themselves in that." Lovely.

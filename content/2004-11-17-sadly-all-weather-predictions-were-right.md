It's snowing in Stockholm, yeah, it is. Three days ago a cousin of mine, Zoran, reported snow in Belgrade and now it's here! Well, the snow does add a shine to the general atmosphere (provided it doesn't turn into thaw in a few hours) as it hopefully means we're getting rid of all that gloomy darkness that envelops us come winter. It's time to sit in-doors, yogi tea in cup and Mikaela next to me.

It's finally here.

Hunter S. Thompson's book has finally been made into film, starring Johnny Depp. As directed by Bruce Robinson.

Yes, the man who wrote and directed "_Withnail & I_".

Therefore, I'm convinced it will be shit. Despite my ten-year-long wait for this, with all the ingredients in place, I'm quite sure it will suck.

Why? Just because everything looks like it'll work! Or maybe I'm just downplaying the entire thing so that I won't be super-disappointed once I see it.

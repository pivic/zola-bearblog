[![](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-12-boltonthumb.jpg)](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-12-bolton5.jpg)I just saw the "The Daily Show" from 2005-03-10, where Condoleezza Rice annonces that the new ambassador representing the USA in the UN is...John Bolton. The Daily Show went on to show how Bolton, in 1994, made [this statement](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-12-bolton5.jpg) on how useless the UN is, and also [this one](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-12-bolton3.jpg), to show what a _man_ he is.

I thought: hey, if onegoodmove hasn't made and posted a cut from this news-worthy event, colour me badd. Well, he has, so shut the hell up and stop singing "[I Wanna Sex You Up](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/color-me-badd/32860.html)". Now! And check [this page](http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/001985.html) out, it's onegoodmove's video post \[QT\] of the event. The political event. Not a video of [Color Me Badd](http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/color_me_badd/bio.jhtml). God damn it.

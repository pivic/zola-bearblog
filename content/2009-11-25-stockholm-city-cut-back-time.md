![Stockholm, the capital of what?](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2009-11-25-stockholm.jpg)

Well, I've been extremely busy at work which means little time to even tinker with blog posts during my breaks.

As Stockholm city - my employer - are outsourcing everything that is connected to IT department to a company called Volvo IT (!), I'm looking for a new job and am thus trying to handle a million different things at once. My current services are going to be severely tweaked and in all probability it looks like [the outsourcing deal will let IT-heads roll](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=sv&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dn.se%2Fsthlm%2F200-av-it-personalen-i-staden-kan-fa-sparken-1.988499).

While Sweden still has a fairly OK stately safety-net in place for those of us who are well off, financially and mentally speaking - the cut-backs that Stockholm city are implementing mean major changes for the special spot where I work:

As part of Stockholm city, the Social Services work for the benefit of people who are in dire need of - or who are deemed needy by the authorities - help, whether it means mental or drug-related rehab, jumping on the job-searching wagon or getting back on track in life in a variety of ways.

The saddest part of all of these cut-backs is that the people who need our help the most are in for the biggest changes.

[Here's a poorly Google-translated post by John Arthur Ekebert](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=sv&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fhemlos.situationsthlm.se%2Fjohnny%2F2009%2F11%2Fhelgens-amne-nedskarningar-ihopslagning-av-instutioner%2F) who recently found out that the housing project where he is staying will be mashed together with two others at another location, which (according to him) means that 70 people will have to make do with one place to try and co-exist.

Money, money, money.

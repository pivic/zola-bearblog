What the hell just happened to the music world? These are the facts:

How did I miss "[Part of the Weekend Never Dies](http://www.partoftheweekendneverdies.com)", a documentary about [Soulwax](http://soulwax.com)? Out September 8th on DVD, [The Guardian speaks](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/aug/30/electronicmusic):

> \[...\] a new Soulwax DVD - part concert film, part documentary - that offers a vibrant record of this frenzied period. Filmed at 120 gigs over two years, Part Of The Weekend Never Dies, by 28-year-old Partizan Films director Saam Farahmand, is a remarkably resonant account of Radio Soulwax, and the scene that surrounds the band. Featuring James Murphy, Peaches, Klaxons and Justice, among others, it is, arguably, the first serious attempt to capture the whole electroclash/new-rave dance scene on celluloid.

 _"Fank you, fo you nice akt-uu!" Kraftwerk and T99 rip-offing included_

Another clip from the DVD is found [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/video/2008/aug/27/soulwax.film).

[Sen Dog](http://www.myspace.com/sendog), sidekick in Cypress Hill, is just about to release an album that's a lot better than anything Cypress Hill has churned out for the past years: hard beats and a voice that shows more than his backup potential.

[Super Furry Animals will release an instrumental album](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/sep/01/super.furry.animals.instrumental) as soon as they finish pruning 24 hours of recorded audial experiences.

[Ed Harcourt is making the album for the next Donnie Darko-film](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/jul/16/news.seanmichaels1), WTF? I really like his music, I really hate the thought of a follow-up for "Donnie Darko", a film I love; but hey - [Ed can play mandolin with The Streets](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/sep/01/ed.harcourt.joins.the.streets), too.

[Dungen](http://www.dungen-music.com)'s new album, "4", is really good psychedelic music; I don't even like that type of music, really don't. So why do I like it?

[Patrick Wolf will release a double album](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/sep/02/patrick.wolf.double.album), probably produced with Alec Empire. Interesting, but only if Empire doesn't bore me as much as with his latest LP, not to mention his making music with Ice Cube, with turned out boring as well. Come on! Revolution action, anybody?

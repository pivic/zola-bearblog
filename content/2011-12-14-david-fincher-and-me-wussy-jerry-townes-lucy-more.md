This morning started off really good. But first, yesterday after work I ran around looking for xmas presents, and saw David Fincher walking on the red carpet at Filmstaden Sergel, just because his new film had its world premiere then and there. Ha! So weird. I was a little star-struck, I was.

All the time, I was listening to **Wussy**:

I think their new album, "**Strawberry**", is a mix of Black Mountain, Arcade Fire, twee-pop and just plain guitar-driven rock. Different lead singers here and there, and it's just...good.

Oh, upon entering Liljeholmstorget today, a local mall, I saw this:

Wee! It's a collection for free teddy bears for all kids. Brilliant. If you've got old ones laying around, dump 'em to somebody else's joy!

On the way out of the mall, I thought of my love and was listening to **Jerry Townes**' "_You Are My Sunshine_" ((Off the brilliant collection titelled "[ECCENTRIC SOUL: THE NICKEL & PENNY LABELS](http://numerogroup.wordpress.com/2011/10/24/eccentric-soul-the-nickel-penny-labels-revealed)".))...which is tacky, I know, but I don't give a rat. Live a little! And dance.

I like tracks like that. Quite bizarre singer, a bit like Motown, Phil Spector, but more home-made. In a very good way. It's got that swaang.

They've done some yuletide decorations at Liljeholmstorget. A suburbian mall pretending to something it's really not, but I appreciate the efforts.

A bit of weird yuletide decorating... No, dear Wife, I didn't get either of them as an xmas gift! I'm sorry, but no.

At work Lucy was celebrated with saffron buns, mulled wine with raisins and almonds in it...and it was calm.

Slussen subway station in the morning. Some art in the background. Maybe not the type of kick you'd wish for in the wee hours if you were a paranoid schizophrenic.

Found this weird jugend-style warning in the elevator in my apartment complex this morning. Was gone when I returned home.

Oh, just Blixa ruling me late last night. There you go.

We spent it with the Maylinn and Criz, drinking a bit of wine, eating bread with soft cheese and a great quinoa salad (last one made by X and myself, so hey to back-slappin'-myself) next to a church on a hill. We sat around, listened to a lot of music off my mobile phone and talked even more. As the sun dissipated we went to Maylinn's place and danced our heads off to Broder Daniel, MGMT, Journey, et al...which was filmed and will never meet the light of day.

We then left to go out, but as DN has some issues with schedules, Bonden Bar was closed when it should have been open, so we left for Kelly's instead, which used to be a really shitty place and _today_ is...a **really** shitty place. We laughed it and its crowd off and went to the hotel bar at [Scandic Malmen](http://www.scandichotels.se/Hotels/Countries/Sweden/Stockholm/Hotels/Scandic-Malmen/) instead. Mojitos and a Pimms Cup were ingested, after which X, Maylinn and myself left for a nearby park where we laughed our heads off to using the swings, a train and a gigantic swing. X and Maylinn looked knocked-out in it and I pushed the swing to great heights as our heads spun and throats went dry from all our laughing. It was absolutely brilliant and was also partially filmed; you guessed it: those films will see public exposure later than [the nazi gold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi%20gold). I remember Maylinn trying to launch herself into a swing designed for children; as X filmed the ordeal of Maylinn trying hard to get out of it while she swore opulently, I laughed myself into a ball while trying to begin to try to help out. Loads of pics were snapped as the night was late and the air was soft and lukewarm; I only wore a vest and that lasted me throughout the night.

All in all: great evening with loads of dancing and to top it off I awoke this morning to having left my camera Bog-knows-where; fortunately enough, it was left at Maylinn's.

**Interesting facts for you**

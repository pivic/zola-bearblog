Yes, Stockholm is snowier than ever - or so it seems. I don't dare to bring my SLR camera with me, so pictures taken outside the home are courtesy of my crappy mobile phone. This time around the winter haze we're getting, I'm happy, though. I'd really love to borrow my old [Stiga Snowracer](http://www.saisports.com/stiga-snowracer/img/king1.jpg) for a day and just kill myself off-pist.

Instead, I offer you [the best sports-chronicle I've read in ages](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/movies/karatekid), thanks to Rade passing it on. The Sports Guy is really amazing, so go read that article. The contents might not be what you're guessing they're about.

Frederic passed on [some funny kitty-pictures](http://flickr.com/photos/nicora), but I like [these](http://www.flickr.com/photos/junku/sets/303691) older ones (that I've written about [before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=735)) more.

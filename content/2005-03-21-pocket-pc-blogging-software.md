As I've checked the net a few times intent on finding blogging software for my Pocket PC, I've found nothing. Until now. [Pocket Blogger](http://www.vb-tech.com/index.aspx?content=pocket_blogger) seems to be the thing. Among other blog platforms (.Text and Movable Type) it's designed to work with WordPress, and it does, at least while it's network connected. It also allows you to blog offline:

> If an internet connection is found, the entry will be added straight to your blog. If an internet connection is not found, the post will be saved away in an XML file. Later, when you have an internet connection, you can select Blog -> Upload All

I'll try to check its mobile capacities out later this evening.

Now I'm heading off from work, to meet Rade.

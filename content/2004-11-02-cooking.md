I cooked some food for Mikaela, but I basically used readymade stuffs. The only thing I didn't "cook" in a microwave oven were the potatoes. Check the whole deal [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-11-01). I forgot to make a salad. I'm utterly useless in the kitchen! The wine was good, but then again I only picked it out, I didn't stomp the grapes, bottle it and huddle it into storage. Argh!

Tonight we're making chicken, so more pics then!

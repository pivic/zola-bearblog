This is hilarious. The following are bits transcribed by yours truly from an interview conducted with [Amy Winehouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy%20Winehouse) by [The Fader](http://www.thefader.com) at [SXSW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%20by%20Southwest) _before_ the former went a little more pear-shaped than is seen here; the video's at the bottom of the post.

**Q**: is this your first show in [Austin](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=30.267153%2C-97.7430608&hl=en&z=13&ie=UTF8)? **A**: yea, I never been to Austin, it's amayzin, it's so coul. **Q**: it's so COLD? **A**: COUL! It's realli coll 'ere, yea.

**Q**: how does this compare to a normal Amy Winehouse show? **A**: uh, I dunno! **Q**: usually, do you have the full rhythm se-- **A**: usually I'm more drunk, I don't know!

**Amy**: I've just had the best time, there's so much barbecue. \[...\] I bought like 10 hot sauces. I-I love [hot sauce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_sauce "Hot sauce"). I just couldn't BELIEVE it.

**Q**: have you been meeting any other musicians in Austin? **A**: ...I can't think...I can't think. **Q**: what is it like \[...\] for you and your circle of, like, peers? **A**: well, i've got little friends who are in bands, but...I dunno, I dunno...I mean, I'm...I'm...I dunno, so many...I'm about, I'm about ten margeritas down already.

**Q**: um...cool...I mean, yeah. Like, any other thoughts about, like, what, what like, you're turned on to right now? Like the hot sauce, we know you're into the hot sauce. **A**: aaaa **Q**: Is anything, what about the U, like, anything in the US particular that has, like, caught you by surprise? That you're like, you've DONE, besides the country, the, like, crowds, are they different from one place to the other? **A**: You know, I like, I just like Ousstin, I like you know, like, the way everyone's is, everyone's so cool, and, eh, I guess I like the way that you can go to a restaurant and get a pound of crawfish and, you know, dump it in the middle of the table, that's kind of cool.

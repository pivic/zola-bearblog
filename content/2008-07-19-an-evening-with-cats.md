Yesterday X and I partied with [The Pirate Cats](http://www.piratkatter.com), actually at their house, where the following fluffy little paranoiac also lives:

    

Yeah, a cat. So how did I survive the ordeal? The answer - if it's not all in my head, of course - is _[Aerius](http://www.fass.se/LIF/produktfakta/artikel_produkt.jsp?NplID=20010115000042&DocTypeID=7&UserTypeID=2)_, a little tutti-frutti-tasting, blue pill that made me survive the cat, known as Nancy. Brilliant. Another step in the way of getting a [Sphynx](http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/sphynx.html) cat.

I drank a little. A little. And things went fine, yeah. All of us - Nancy excluded - went on a nightly excursion to buy pizzas in the middle of the night. That went fine as well, as far as chasing bunnies goes; I went after one with my mobile camera, filming it. Very Richard David Attenborough, apart for the good stuff. I didn't catch the bunneh, and the footage is unusable. Still, I moved more in that little time than I have in more than 1,5 weeks. Ah. I love my vacation.

Today I saw "_Little Miss Sunshine_". It was good.

I'm lazy. I'm liking it. It's like being buzzed from good alcohol, having friends around you, but while you're still in control of everything, you know? But I'm at home, having spent the day making dinner with X, loafing about, watching the inexplicably horrid old Swedish TV reality-soap "_Paradise Hotel_", too.

I'm loving my vacation.

The Swedish police have done good. Or they might just have been forced to. Anyway, together with state officials, Swedish cops tested to see if a night-club would accept a bunch of preppily dressed lads who hadn't drunk anything, of "non-European heritage", or not. They didn't, saying the place was specially rented for the evening and that they weren't welcome.

The police then, a few minutes later, sent a bunch of "non-Europeans" to the same place, who were welcomed without any words of the place being rented at the time.

The above has now led to a task force being formed, with the sole purpose to test restaurants and night-clubs to see if would-be guests are being discriminated in any way, from entering the premises. The cops will dress as civilians and try suspect places. Another reason for this is that although there have been a lot of discussion in the media and a lot of media outlets having found racism and other forms of discrimination existing far and wide in this manner (often by doing vital tests of their own, just like the cops have, as mentioned above), it has been virtually impossible to carry discrimination cases into courts. Word against word doesn't work very well.

This issue has been a problem for long in Sweden, that isn't as fair-and-free a country as many may believe. The 60's myth of free love and free...whatever doesn't ring at all true in this scenario. During gay pride marches, people get abused, physically and verbally. Foreigners are mostly just flicked off when searching for jobs; some have even changed their names and found better luck that way, horribly enough.

Of course it's not a matter of subjecting to the idiots. That wouldn't even cross my mind. I wouldn't dream of changing my surname just to get a job, not when I have the good fortune to live in Sweden, a country where it's quite hard to get trampled on by the social services (and I'm _not_ writing this because I work for the bleedin' social services), even though the number of homeless people in Stockholm are somewhere around 4000, methinks.

But. If you're a non-European male, getting rejected by door-guards when you're trying to get into a club for the seventh time in a row during an evening, as you hear the club's "filled to the brim" or "rented" to find that blond-haired, blue-eyed guys wearing the same clothes as you and who also appear sober like you get in without having anything to do with "renting" the place or you're watching any body getting out of the place - I'd blow a f-ing fuse. Some of these afflicted people go elsewhere, and imagine the fucking gall some people have when they're spewing bile over "foreigners" for starting clubs where only "they" go and hence distort integration in society. Yeah, like those pesky people in the concentration camps, not letting the poor nazi guards in to play.

Some non-Europeans book tables at the places where they wanna go, to be sure they can't get evicted when the club starts.

I can't emphasise how much I hate discrimination. I really loathe it. I tend to treat people the same as they treat me, for good and bad (mostly good though, as I see it), but I really pity people who discriminate.

"[Vera Drake](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383694)", directed by Mike Leigh, has already won the Golden Lion in Venice, and now [cleared most awards at the British Independent Film Awards](http://www.bifa.org.uk/news_story.php?news=16). Even though filming nearly stopped because of lack of funding, it passed and is now a great success. Not bad for a film including abortion, which, by the way, seems to have become a much more interesting theme than before. Even in Bill Hicks' time (we're talking (at least) off the "[Rant In E-Minor](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:r09ss38ua3dg)" album here, released in 1997 but recorded throughout 1993), when saying he hoped a few lines on child murder and, if you will, killing foetuses would pull a healthy gut-laugh from the audience. People, [like Interpol](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=385), are touchy. By that way, wasn't "Touchy" a song by Thompson Twins?

Besides, Jesper (maybe Mikaela) and I will go to Blond tonight, the club where Vardagsrum is, which I've reported of [previously](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=356). Check some pictures of the place [here](http://www.lysypingwin.se/pingwin/gallery_view.php?Gallery=test).

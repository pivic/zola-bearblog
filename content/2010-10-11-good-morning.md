I'm just grumpy. I started the morning with dousing myself and the kitchen carpet in coffee, and I'd love to have slept longer.

Having said that, I can't wait to get back home. This weekend with X and great friends has been loving and just wonderful.

I feel like I'm Ted Danson's character in "_Bored To Death_".

I give thanks for [MozBackup](http://backup.jasnapaka.com), a brilliant little application that's free and that backs up and restores everything Mozilla - except for Mozilla Sunbird, the Mozilla free calendar project.

For those of you still living in oblivion in the aftermath of Laura Branigan's death, check further info on what Mozilla Firefox, the premier web browser, is [right here](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox).

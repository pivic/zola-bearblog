I just spoke with a user who said he had logged into the network, but that he couldn't log into the system. "The system"? Sure, they're a bit spooked when calling the helpdesk for the first time (as this user did), and I know most support people are idiots, so no problem. Here are a few bits of reality for you:

I: So which system are you having difficulty logging into? He: I can't...the system...it's saying something. I: Is it displaying an error message? H: Well...no, well, yes. I: What is it saying? H: The old usual, ha ha. I: I need to know exactly what's stated in the dialogue box. H: Well, you know, "The system..."...the usual! I: I need to know exactly what's stated in the dialogue box. H: OK, it's "The system cannot log you in." I: Is that exactly all that is stated in that box? H: Well, no...\[continues to read the dialogue box\] "The system cannot log you into the network." I: Oh, so you haven't logged into the network at all! H: Precisely. I: \[...\]

\[a few minutes later, having provided the user with a fresh temporary password, which is to be automatically changed by the user after he's entered it\]

H: Well...this isn't working. I: Pardon, but exactly what is not working? Is the computer displaying any kind of error messages? H: Well...it's not...it's not...it's not... \[every three full-stops represent approximately five seconds of pause\] I: \[...\] H: It's not working. I: \[...\] H: Nothing happens. I: Oh! Have you typed your new password, the temporary one I gave you? H: Well...I think so.

\[after two minutes more we conclude he has entered his password and that he has a dialogue box open, asking him to change his password\]

H: Well...so what now? I: Now, as I've stated previously, type your temporary password once, then a completely new one that you have to come up with yourself, which must not contain any Swedish characters, i.e. å, ä or ö. H: Eh...what? I: Type your temporary password once, then a completely new one that you have to come up with yourself, which must not contain any Swedish characters, i.e. å, ä or ö. H: OK.

\[time passes, and I hear him typing away\]

H: Now everything's gone blue! I: I understand; you've successfully changed your password and are on your way to logging in. The blue screen is just displayed before the system will start loading your personal settings for Windows. H: No, it's just blue! I: You are on your way to logging in. The blue screen is just displayed before the system will start loading your personal settings for Windows. H: It's all blue! I: \[...\] H: Eh...ah...eh... I: Can you see a box saying "Windows is now loading your personal settings..." or similar? H: Well...no. I: Is there any box visible, or is the screen still blue? H: No. I: Is there any box visible, or is the screen still blue? H: Yes! There's a box there! I: What does it say? H: Something about personal settings being loaded. I: I.e. what I asked you for. Now everything's alright, and you are successfully on your way to logging into the network! H: Well...ah...thanks!

Mostly the questions are pretty easy to answer and the users are very helpful, quick and nice. The above is just smeg in an otherwise quite clear sky.

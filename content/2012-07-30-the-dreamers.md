> **Matthew**: The first time I saw a movie at the cinématà¨que franà§aise I thought, "Only the French... only the French would house a cinema inside a palace."

I think [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309987) is a lucid film set in the late 1960s Paris, where a young American man meets two siblings who not only share a weird relation to their father but a lot weirder stuff between themselves. Filled with little twists and turns, this film at times felt beautiful without becoming arty-farty or boring. Maybe a bit too film buff, though. All in all: recommended.

> **Matthew**: I was one of the insatiables. The ones you'd always find sitting closest to the screen. Why do we sit so close? Maybe it was because we wanted to receive the images first. When they were still new, still fresh. Before they cleared the hurdles of the rows behind us. Before they'd been relayed back from row to row, spectator to spectator; until worn out, secondhand, the size of a postage stamp, it returned to the projectionist's cabin. Maybe, too, the screen was really a screen. It screened us... from the world.

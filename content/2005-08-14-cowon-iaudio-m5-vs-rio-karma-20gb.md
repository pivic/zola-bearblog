Now that the [Cowon iAUDIO M5](http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news_10023.html) is released, I guess it's just a matter of waiting for it to drop in Sweden. I hope that's soon, even though [the American Cowon-site](http://www.cowonamerica.com) doesn't display anything on the M5.

So, what differs the M5 from the [X5](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=niklasblog-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/B0009Q4U7Y)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1) from the same company? Well, the M5 doesn't have a colour-screen and is void of film-playing capacities. Great! Hence, the price is lower and I'm expecting it to drop around 2000-2500SKR (roughly â‚¬200 or 300USD) when it's released here in Sweden. I think I'll go for it straightaway if that's the price. The many features, constant development and good hardware build is what tells me it will rule over the Rio Karma.

More on the product [here](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000020054178), and you'll find the Korean site (which is, today, the only Cowon-site carrying info on it - in sprightly Korean, of course) [here](http://mp3.iaudio.com/product/product_M5_feature.php), and my big rant on the absence of a FLAC-playing audio-player in my life, [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=718).

Now, if I could just erase the image of the coming [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770) from my head...

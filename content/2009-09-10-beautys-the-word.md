Sometimes beauty just manifests, without trying to conjure it. I love the picture above, by a photographer unknown to me. It reminds me a lot of [Gus van Sant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus%20Van%20Sant)'s film "[Paranoid Park](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0842929/)".

And I do believe, which may sound contrived and narcissistic, that I've created something nice myself. At least in spots: I've finished my first short-story in ages and I'll let you know more about it when it gets formatted. My mate Peter's on the case, which means he's going to [typeset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting) the story. I suspect most people will deem the set piece to be more interesting than the actual contents...

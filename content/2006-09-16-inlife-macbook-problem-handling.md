While [not even CNet have managed to get Apple to say anything on the shutdown-issue](http://news.com.com/2061-10793_3-6115931.html), and [Apple's support-page on the issue](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304308) is not upgraded, on Wednesday I was contacted by a person working for The Swedish Consumer Agency, who told me I was in the right about having the right to annul my purchase. With this in mind, I rang inLife (as they had not contacted me as they said they would). Here's a run-down on what happened then.

14:15: I called inLife and asked what was happening with my MacBook. After words, I was connected to one of the two people named Anders, which was the only name I got from the person who, two days ago, promised somebody would call me within two days. A person answered, and said "Wait while I check my mail", and put me on hold. After circa four minutes, the dial-tone went dead.

14:20: I called again, and was connected to the person I waited to speak with, but was only met by a dial-tone for five minutes, and then, suddenly, the receiver lifted the phone on his side and slammed the receiver down. The person on the other end actually let my call wait for five minutes, and then hung up on me.

Unbelievable, and unacceptable.

14:25: I called inLife again, and spoke with a person to whom I aired the problems I had just met, when attempting to speak with the person who initially promised me that somebody would ring me (about my MacBook problem); he met me with no apologies, and told me that their policy is that any customer asking to annul a purchase must talk with the person who sold them said item. I was then connected to that person, who told me annulling the purchase would be "hard". He told me he would ring me back about the matter as soon as possible.

15:10: the sales-person called me back and asked me to call Apple to get a reference-number, which would speed matters up significantly, and then call back with said number.

15:13: I spoke with a person working as frontline support at Apple Care, who directed me to another person at Apple. This person was most quick, and asked me why I was to have a reference-number, as any claim to have a purchase annulled only mattered between a customer and the company that had sold the customer said product. I told him he was right, and he said "sure, I'll give you a reference-number, but this is _not_ a guarantee saying inLife are entitled to money back from us, should said purchase be annulled" to which I said I understood the matter completely.

15:23: I spoke with the sales-person at inLife who told me I had to bring the computer around the next day with the reference-number and I would "speak with the boys" about the matter.

**The next day** (i.e. yesterday)

09:45: a new person from inLife calls and informs me that he had spoken with the person I last spoke with, at inLife, and that I were to repeat my problems to him. As I doubt they've exchanged pertinent information, I say this and nevertheless tell him about my problems; he indicates that the new version of the logic-board and heatsink is "guaranteed" to solve this. I then told him that Apple had not confirmed this. Could I quote him on this? "Weeeeelllll..." was the only reply to this. Of course. The call ended without any new information or any contact that, indeed, did matter whatsoever. I then left for inLife.

10:20: at inLife I was met by three different people, and had to repeat my problem again, to a new person. They admitted my computer for "ocular inspection", and I now await further instructions to be able to annul my purchase. I'll have to wait three days until a technician tells me what's up, though.

I'm going to settle for Gallery as my web gallery of choice. I've listed quite a few reasons in [this old post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=748), and now it's go, go, go. I'm even satisfied with the current beta-version I'm running.

And I've just uploaded the outtakes from my evening out with Jesper, plus a few pictures from yesterday, when I took pictures of Frederic's kittys and one of him, DJ'ing at Kaf√© 44:an. That gig was extremely crap, as no-one was dancing. [Here](https://niklasblog.com/gallery2) you'll find the galleries, and there's always gonna be a link on the sidebar of this blog, pointing to the gallery.

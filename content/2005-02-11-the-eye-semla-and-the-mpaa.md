![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-02-11-semla.gif)Yesterday, while doing a bit of washing up, my left eye started itching and so I thought I brushed it using a liquid-free finger. I was wrong. The eye immediately stung as if somebody had poured lye into it \[well, I have to use some sort of metaphor, right?\] so I rushed to the bathroom and started to pour water into it like mad. The cold water chilled my eyelid stuck so that I looked like [Thom Yorke](http://groups.msn.com/_Secure/0XgBBAzUdp3Fnw!cZt8qWi*yVmFIXhi!oIfFNNbqYX2M39FX826Ss7KP4nRPrWrWYuiiTBUmyP2AfH*MyN0g11cOYGmHSM7qlv4xT69KimoHQxxicaNwLtYi27uBG87WqSsl9g94RfCo/Thom%20Yorke%20-%20Wallpaper.jpg) out of Radiohead, and everything went red. It felt like the lens was going crumbled. I became afraid that I'd become blind on my left eye - quick, what's worse, having bad vision on the left eye, or no eye-sight in the left eye at all? Having washed the eye a few times more, concentrated on watching through "The Predator", yes, the oldish Arnold-movie. I remember the special effects as better, and there were actually a few shots in the film where the [squibs](http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn?stage=1&word=squib) on people didn't explode in synch with the battle action that was supposed to trigger them, i.e. Arnold & company killing others. My eye was then still upside-down, so I did the only thing a man should have. I threw up.

In order to get my tear ducts rolling, as I suspected there being washing-up-liquid in them, I had to throw up. Unlike some people, like the Swedish actress Helena Bergström or the American Neve Campbell, I'm unable to cry whenever I show my face, so I had to throw up to get some tear action. I don't know if it helped much. If you e-mail me I'll make sure to give you a very detailed description of what actually happened.

Anyway, I went to sleep after a while, woke up in the middle of the night from my ailing eye, and splashed it with water. Naturally, I blinked a lot of times, just causing the eye to get more irritated, so I went back to the bathroom, splashed the eye with water again, and closed my eyes. I imagined being blind. Would it really be that bad? Hell yes, it would. Would you rather be blind or deaf? Really, a good question. I love music, but losing vision would be totally fucked-up. How the hell would I know, anyway? So I went to the bed with my eyes closed, and fell asleep.

In the morning the eye was covered with crust. Thank gawd for the human body's way of regenerating. I called the nearest health centre, where an ironic nurse ("Oh, covering your eye in washing-up-liquid isn't a very good idea, now, is it?") told me not to worry - if the eye still gives me hell on Sunday I'll have to go to a doctor about the ordeal, otherwise, just go to the local pharmacist and get some sterile water. No problem. I got that, actually two different sets of sterile waters (one flask and one spray), which says a lot about me being scared when ill in some way although I'm quite calm when others are in medical need, and then bought a "semla."

According to [Lexin](http://www-lexikon.nada.kth.se/skolverket/sve-eng.shtml), a very good Swedish-English online translation service, a Swedish semla is "semla" in English. It's also called "cream bun". [Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-02-11) are some pictures of them and of my Yorkeish eye.

The MPAA has just closed down Lokitorrent, as you can see [here](http://www.lokitorrent.com). Their note is quite good methinks, and of course, piracy goes on. It will never be stopped, but it's a good thing to remember, that people seem to be buying their stuff as they get older, as opposed to when they were younger and only downloading stuff through the internet. If I truly love an album, if I listen to it constantly, I buy it. If somebody releases an album that's non-buyable, like that Kleptones mix-album I referred to earlier this week, and I listen to it constantly (which I do with said mix-album) I can't buy it, which is sad. On the other hand, they haven't asked for permissions to have the samples and songs licensed. What am I trying to say? Hm. Kids, if you like it, buy it. If it's shit, throw it away.

What you see is me sleeping. Using a program called [Dream recorder](http://www.dream-recorder.com), I looked into how I slept last night. The software produced this 9-second film by compiling 186 iSight snapshots taken during the night ((Of course using the built-in webcam in the Apple MacBook I was using.)) into the film.

The program also produced [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/380244973) picture, where bars indicate movement; the higher a bar is, the more I've moved during the night. Looks like 00:30, 01:30 and 03:00 were the interesting hours. Do note that the yellow bar indicates a dream sequence that the software tried to trigger using sounds - in this case, waves crashing onto a beach. It looks like it made me dream harder, and slightly after the sounds stopped I notably moved around.

Quite an interesting little novelty-program, this one!

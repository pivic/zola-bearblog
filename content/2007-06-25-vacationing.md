I'm watching two kids stalking a duck mother who's swimming with her duckling. The air is cool and I'm suave, hearing people laugh while basking in the sun that's temporarily covered by clouds.

I've never been much for seeing stuff in the ways clouds shape. I wonder if that'd make me a bad Rorschach candidate.

Life's good to me right now. More sun, please. Jihad on all things bad. I suddenly feel like I'm on top. All I'm missing is a home-made badminton court, the proper gear and someone to play with.

The kids abandoned the ducks and now concentrate on hysterics, yelling about a snake near the water. A dad is sane, telling his kids to leave the poor serpent alone. The kids rush off to swim.

I'm antropomorphising. A duck's next to me, wanting something. Could be it's trying to communicate. Or I'm going slightly insane from drinking too little water.

Life is indeed good. Soon I'll have company. Wonderful.

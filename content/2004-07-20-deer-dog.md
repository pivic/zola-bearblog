A friend of a friend who works at the Helen Woodward Animal Center, recently picked up a fawn that somebody had found under the steps of their house. My friend's friend found it to work perfectly together with the family's Ridgeback dog. Once the fawn is back to normal, it will be sent to some people who has had experience with deer, and will then release it back into the wild. Pictures of the two are found [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-20-dog-and-deer1.jpg), [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-20-dog-and-deer2.jpg) and [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-20-dog-and-deer3.jpg).

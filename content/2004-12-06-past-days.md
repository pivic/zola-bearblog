So, why haven't I updated my blog earlier than this?

The reason is simple: I've had too much to do at work. I was responsible for setting up our new intranet web-server, with no documentation about the previous installation existing, this proved to be a real nutcracker. I had to discover exactly how the many different components were set up, who I was to contact regarding all kinds of systems and what to do at what times. Incredible, yet I think I managed to pull it off. Everything worked after the move! There were a lot of systems involved, so I've been working pretty much full-time on this project for the past three weeks, testing and double-testing everything in order to avoid disaster when I swapped the servers. It worked like a charm, also much due to Alex, one of my co-workers, as he's an incredible talent when it comes to IT and problem-solving.

Anyway, after work on Thursday I met with Andreas, a friend since upper secondary school. We ate and downed caffé lattes together, having fun. He's an inspiration, a real thinker, not somebody who just speaks a lot of shit. Jesper then joined us and we had fun until we had to leave for "Blond", the club at Vardagsrum, where Jesper and I were a month previously. On the way to the subway we stopped to say ciao to Andreas, who was going somewhere else. Suddenly a man came up to us, told Jesper he was a "\[insert expletive here, describing the female genitalia\]-head" and smelled of beer. He had a can in one of his jacket pockets. I immediately noticed something was weird with his head, and sure enough, on closer inspection it looked like he's had an iron hammer jammed into his forehead at some point in his life. It looked really, really weird. Anyway, he behaved very strange, not like a drunk but more like a person who's totally messed up from severe head trauma. He moved irratically, asked us if we wanted to fight, told us we were pussies and added "Never mind me, I'm just drunk". The only thing that ran through my mind at the time was "If he punches me I'll make sure I have somewhere to run as that fat bastard probably won't be able to catch up with me." After we all were silent for 20 seconds, he went away, immediately grabbing a smallish girl (appx. 20 years old), hugging her and laughing. She tried to shrug him off, but he stayed where he was. She then yanked him loose and skipped a few steps, mobile phone in hand during the whole ordeal. The next woman who went in his direction got the same treatment. He screamed aloud when the third victim was male. Anyway, Jesper and I left in the other direction and quickly got in at Roxy, the restaurant I've been writing about.

It's still good. The service is personal and very nice, the waitresses all attentive and subjective as hell. If I'm in a non-decisive mood I just let them decide. So, Jesper had beers and I downed Fernet for a while. Even the darned bar-seats are nice at Roxy; we left the place after 45 minutes and headed to Blond, where we found Evelina at the door and her boyfriend staying around. He has a thing about sewing words on his clothes, so this time he hacked up words from a sweater and made his own, stating "NO WAR". [Here are a few pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-12-01) from the place. As Jesper had won three drinks the previous time, he cashed them in (as beers anyway) and the party went on. There were a couple of DJ's in the house, playing under their fabolous "Konichiwa Bitches" moniker. They had a couple of problems. First, they played using iPod's, which posed problems as they didn't have a signal amplifier which meant that every time they switched songs, the volume jumped up quite a few notches, scaring and nearly making people deaf in the process. The second problem was that they started their gig with playing ten A Tribe Called Quest tracks. I mean, I like them, but ten tracks in a row, and only newer ATCQ-tracks at that? If you've never heard them, let me say this: their drum-track sounds exactly the same on every track during the latter part of their career. That's revolting. So naturally we nearly died, but held our breaths. After ten tracks though they switched. But we weren't there to bicker!

We started to play table tennis with some other people at the place. It was so much fun I played for nearly two hours in a row. The day after I got blisters, but it was absolutely worth it. I laughed so much at smashing Jesper when getting to the finals a few times, moahaha! Marie (Jesper's girlfriend) smashed me out of the game one time though!

A new artist, [Laleh](http://www.laleh.se), played a gig. The band was only herself and an acoustic guitar. As she's from Iraq, her voice was fairly Arabically tinged, featuring the quirks you can hear when listening to Arabic singers, e.g. Natasha Atlas and Khaled. She sounds like a mix of Natasha Atlas, Cornelis Vreeswijk (a late Swedish singer-songwriter) and at times even like Blixa Bargeld, the Einstürzende Neubauten front figure. She was very good, although her talking between tracks was quite irritating. Something like "Oh...I think of all the crumbs on the table...like whispers in the garden...exhilerating...and...sometimes...I like flowers and...you...staaaanding by a board." Like that. So I got fed up. When she said "Oh, I don't know...which song should I play next?" I shouted "Anarchy In The UK" and the whole place went quiet. Luckily, I had drunk a few Fernets before this, so I wasn't embarrassed. I just sank and giggled at my own joke. She did reply: "Are you for real? A _cover_?" I'm still not sure if she was appalled at the suggestion itself or if she just didn't want to hear a cover. Anyway, the show went on. But when we left the room, Marie became furious at me: "I think you were completely lacking in respect for her." I was amazed. "What, don't you think she saw the humor?" I replied. "I just think you should have kept your mouth shut", she said. "Well, if she would have wanted me to shut up, don't you think she would have said so? Lighten up!" We didn't speak for a little while, but then it passed over. I think people should have more humor about these things. Scenes that get hysterically "serious" are mostly begging for something funny to happen.

We left for the table tennis court to find that appx. 20 people were playing. And so were we! A guy named Takeshi stood beside me, was kinda funny even if he said "Just call me Taxi. Everybody in Sweden does!" and fired of the shrillest, loudest laugh I've heard in a long time, and continued to laugh at nearly everything, he was fun. The most fun were the people who took the table tennis extremely serious, aiming not to have fun but to try and beat everybody with brute force. When people made fun of them, they got mad and easily missed smashes and couldn't manage to make plain passes, so that was just fun. Well, after that we all went home and I'm surely coming back the next time. This is one of the best clubs in Stockholm, providing variety, a sense of ease and relaxation and also live artists and different DJ's.

This Saturday we visited Patrik and Staffan, who threw a party where roughly 30 people bounced about. The guys live in a big, very nicely fashioned apartment in the south side of Stockholm. I guess Patrik's having a fit reading this, from fear of anybody getting the notion the apartment's otherwhere than in the south side of Stockholm _city_, hah! Mikaela and I went there with Frederic, who was sporting a new Paul Smith tee. I, too, was wearing something Paul Smith, a new shirt that's wicked; I must confess I love the PS shirts, and would pay almost anything to get the ones I love, of which there are plenty. Anyway, [here are a few pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-12-05) of the clothes (and some from a walk Mikaela and I took yesterday), and bear in mind that Mikaela's outfit was actually sewn for her mother a couple of decades ago...by her father! He's that good. So, we carried on to P&S where Staffan was acting the bartender and Patrik the hostess. We went around saying hi to all people. Most came from Patrik and Mikaela's work-place. I'd heard of most of them long since. I spoke with åsa, who is soon getting [a British Shorthair kitten, named Frasse](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-12-06-frasse.jpg). It's such a cute kitty.

The people at the party were nice, mad, interesting and boring, hence, a great mix. Somebody resembling Gollum stalked Frederic for a while. I laughed myself into a fit from watching how Gollum watched Frederic's ass. I spoke with some really nice people, downing drinks and wine courtesy of P&S. Their food was excellent. A buffet of salmon, chicken, salads, shrimp, bread, crustini, et.c. was on display and very delicious. We left at 02:30 and awoke quietly at 13:00 the day after, when we went on a little walk that was very nice. More walks required, fo sho!

Now I'm at work, just after lunch, having quarreled with the people at Legymés, the place where I usually go for lunch. Today, they managed to take 600SKR outta my bank account instead of 60SKR, so they wanted to give me the money in cash. Argh, bastards. Now, they're not bastards because of that little mistake that anybody could make. They're bastards because I was treated like an illegitimate stepchild who tried to get a meal, Oliver Twist style. Damn that. Anyway, I got my walk on real fast. The adrenaline boosted me!

I just read that Oxfam thinks the rich countries that are getting richer are also getting greedier, not helping the poor countries in the world that are in debt. Bastards, they too! [Check this BBC article about it](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4071043.stm). I mean, children are dying from this, the greediness of countries. "Oxfam says rich countries such as the US, Germany and Japan have broken a pledge made 1970 to make available 0.7% of their gross national incomes in aid." Bastards!

Today a carpenter is coming over to make us a new computer desk. The old one is a shabby, triangular thing courtesy of IKEA, so it's gonna get tossed away. I'm really looking forward to this new get-up.

Gotta get moving. I'm listening far too much to country right now, Jerry Reed singing about "Amos Moses" and Willie Nelson about being "Crazy".

HBO has a newish TV-series out called "**[Girls](http://www.hbo.com/girls/index.html)**".

Even the soundtrack - the latest episode sported tracks by The Knife and Belle and Sebastian - is radiant when it comes to this show. There are some jaw-dropping one-liners in there as well, but trust me, you should get coherence by seeing the entire thing. Every line is pulled from different parts of the series:

**Hannah** to her boss: I just tried to fuck you, sue you, and extort you. I'm fucking nuts! Why would you want me in your office?

**Hannah**: OK, I think I got everything: testicles, spectacles, wallet and watch.

**Adam**: I don't know what it is about me but girls never ask me to use condoms.

**Hannah**: You know what I'm gonna do from now on? I'm gonna ask people if they're gay before I have sex with them.

**Hannah**: It's like, "Sorry I passed you an STD but I really enjoy your quirky web presence."

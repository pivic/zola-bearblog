I didn't catch word of [Camera Obscura](http://www.camera-obscura.net)'s greatness until I started listening to their "[Let's Get Out Of This Country](http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000FFJ8CG.01._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_V65933314_.jpg)", from which the following track is culled.

It's one thing when bands sound a bit like Belle and Sebastian, but when they've got more than just that initial bang you feel when you're thinking "Oh, this sounds like..." you're glad; this is way more than that. This track shows great composition, song, lyrics, arrangement and production and is a winner with great riffs, a slightly pounding bass and violins. No sax. Pardon the pun.

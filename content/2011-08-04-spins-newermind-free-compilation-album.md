[![Newermind](http://www.spin.com/sites/spin.com/files/imagecache/huge_page_view/sites/spin.com/files/Newermind_CD.jpg)](http://www.spin.com/articles/free-album-spin-tribute-nirvanas-nevermind)

Nirvana's album "**Nevermind**" is turning 20 years old, and yes, believe it. Also, Spin magazine have decided to put together a compilation album and release it for free. It's actually a little weird to hear so many good contributions on a free album, but then again, are tribute albums, free or nay, almost ever any good?

EMA's version of "_Nameless Endless_" is brilliant. Almost a little too pretentious in its punkiness, but it works, by jove. You can watch a video of the recording [here](http://www.spin.com/articles/exclusive-watch-emas-nevermind-music-video), and it was shot in VHS and then digitised.

Go git! I wanna know your fave songs.

Me? I like "**Nevermind**" and I love "**In Utero**", which is my favourite Nirvana album.

Get "**Newermind**" [here](http://www.spin.com/articles/free-album-spin-tribute-nirvanas-nevermind).

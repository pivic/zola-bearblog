I've just entrusted [LAN Master](http://www.lan-master.se) (what a name!) with my MacBook, as they are to repair it. There are three things currently ailing:

1\. The shutdowns. 2. The boot-issue. 3. The miscoloured wrist-rests.

These are explained a little more [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1027), although I actually - which may be due to my suddenly viewing the MacBook as a techy version of the Bermuda triangle - just discovered the miscoloured wrist-rests. Anyway, it seems Apple are now mixing the plastic for the case better, which means it'll be repaired; mind you, I believe this is the only one of said three problems that Apple have taken responsibility for and actions with.

Due to a massive work-load, LAN Master have stated that a technician will check my problem out in five work-days. Let's see what's taken care of, next Friday.

Too bad that this happened just as I started enjoying a trial of [OmniOutliner Pro](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/pro), which looks _really_ nice.

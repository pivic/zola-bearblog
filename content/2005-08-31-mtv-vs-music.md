Taken from a music blog I cannot remember the name of, this is very accurate view of MTV:

> I'm looking at the list of winners from last night's MTV Video Awards, and there's what - five videos total collectively sweeping 20 or so categories? That's pretty much MTV's entire video rotation, isn't it?

Check the list of the MTV Video Awards-winners [here](http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2005/08/29/1192194-ap.html).

Besides, this reminds me of the first Live Aid-concert. MTV promised "all artists, all the time", but when RUN-D.M.C. went on, MTV broadcast an hour of "news" instead. Oh, and RUN-D.M.C. were the only blacks playing at the time. This, in turn, reminds me that the music label CBS threatened MTV with total boycott if they refused to play their next big wonder, Michael Jackson; thing was, MTV didn't want to play him all that much. Why? Maybe because of the very same reason the show "[YO! MTV Raps](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158443)" was aired after midnight every day - until hip-hop became mainstream.

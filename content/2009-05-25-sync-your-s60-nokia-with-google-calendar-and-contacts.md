Previously, Google has supported sync of contacts through GMail/Google Apps on a few Nokia mobiles, but now, any Nokia that supports [the S60 Mail for Exchange application](http://www.businesssoftware.nokia.com/mail_for_exchange_downloads.php) will allow you to have your mobile phone sync with both contacts and calendar.

Finally, without having to connect your phone to a computer, no less. Google's official post on the subject is found [here](http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2009/05/google-sync-beta-now-for-s60_20.html).

It allows you to either sync manually or automatically. You can configure the application as often as you want (in set intervals) and even configure two different profiles for when/if/how often you want the application to sync for you.

When setting up, I saw differences between [the Google setup instructions](http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=147951) and the S60 app. By the way, I should add that I downloaded Mail For Exchange 2.9.158 S60 3.1. While the instructions say I should leave the domain field blank, it was obligatory. Just enter **m.google.com** and you're set. Otherwise, the instructions were working well for me, and I hooked up the app with my Google Apps domain. [Here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/15784250)'s the user guide for Mail for Exchange, by the way.

Three cheers for Microsoft! Now, if only they'd integrate [the recently incorporated tasks](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/tasks-now-in-calendar-too.html)...

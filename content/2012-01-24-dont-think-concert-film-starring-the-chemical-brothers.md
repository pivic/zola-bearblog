Woo! Coming soon, "_**[Don't Think](http://www.dontthinkmovie.com)**_", a concert film starring [The Chemical Brothers](http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com), as directed by [Adam Smith](http://www.flatnosegeorge.com). Looks like the one concert film I'd love to see since Soulwax's "_[Part Of The Weekend Never Dies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3tTGb-PiCw)_".

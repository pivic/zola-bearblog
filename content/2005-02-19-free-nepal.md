I've been reading [Radio Free Nepal](http://freenepal.blogspot.com), a blog fronted by anonymous contributors. This is because the newly self-appointed king of Nepal, Gyandendra, took power through a coup d'état and is trying hard to make democracy and free thought illegal. As the Radio Free Nepal people write in their blog:

> King Gyandendra of Nepal has issued a ban on independent news broadcasts and has threatened to punish newspapers for reports that run counter to the official monarchist line. Given that any person in Nepal publishing reports critical of "the spirit of the royal proclamation" is subject to punishment and/or imprisonment, contributors to this blog will publish their reports from Nepal anonymously.

They still oppose the bastard through blogging, to make people understand what's going on. Many a Nepalese are doing their best to expose this heinous threat to democracy, and this is a front to see some of it. Examples from the blog:

> The King of Nepal cut telephone lines in and out of the country today in an attempt to squash potential protests against the monarch. In an interview, he said he took control at the beginning of this month to protect the constitutional monarchy for democracy and avoid political instability. Political analysts say the military and police are staunch supporters of the king and masterminded the takeover. Maoist rebels have been struggling since 1996 to establish communist rule. More than 11-thousand people have been killed in the related violence. Yet, the Maoists have considerable popular support in some regions of the country. In other regions, people say they are fed up with corruption and instability and support the king.

Also a few lines from the blog on the bravery of some people in Nepal:

> Himal, a fortnightly newsmagazine that never failed to criticize the King's role in the past, came up in the bravest way. The first issue after the coup was published two days ago and ran a full page advertisement and a note by editor to tell the readers that the magazine has been censored and claimed that it would soon change. The ad with two photographs, the first with the mountain (mountain is Himal in Nepali) covered by clouds with caption Mountain is blocked “¦ and the second without clouds saying “¦ but will again be unblocked, is so vivid in meaning that everybody understood the hidden meaning.

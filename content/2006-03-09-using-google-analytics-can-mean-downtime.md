title : "Using Google Analytics can mean downtime"

I just tried to browse to a site that's never been down before, and discovered it was unreachable. Strange! I saw my browser trying to connect with [Google Analytics](http://www.google-analytics.com), but couldn't do it.

The reason to why the site was unreachable? Google Analytics.

Registering with GA enables a user to insert a little bit of javascript code into a web site, and presto, one gets very nice stats of how many visits the site. I'm sure techy-enough people are able to code the problem away. Hey, if it affected everybody using GA, it _could_ actually affect my site, ha. Wait a minute...it did! This blog was unreachable, trying to knock on the unopenable door of GA.

GA has been under a lot of stress as the number of users taking advantage of their very nice, free services is surely staggering, so I'm not surprised it backlashed, taking a few sites with it.

I've deactivated my GA plug-in for the time being.

**edit**: [others](http://digg.com/technology/Google_Analytics_killed_my_site_) have noted this bug.

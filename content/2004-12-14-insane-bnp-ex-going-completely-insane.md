The BBC News report the following, from [this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4094275.stm):

> The leader of the British National Party has been arrested as part of a police inquiry following the screening of a BBC documentary.
> 
> A party spokesman said Nick Griffin was arrested on Tuesday morning on suspicion of incitement to commit racial hatred.

Nice one, idiot. Just goes to show how little they know, especially since [their last known moronic deeds](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=391) that I reported of.

By the way, imagine my laughter \[note: you cannot, it was too loud, and still is\] was when I read today's copy of DN and discovered [a long interview](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=574&a=354999&previousRenderType=2) with an ex girlfriend and her boyfriend, who are totally into "Friends". Yes, the American sitcom where racism doesn't exist, since no other races than white exist. And no worldly problems, of course. Here are a couple of quotes from the article:

"You know exactly what's going to happen, and still you end up laughing!"

"She feels she knows the characters so well, it's like they're her pals in real life, too."

Re. going to bed, the interviewer writes the following about her boyfriend:

"'When I look one way I see \[former girlfriend\]. If I turn my head "Ross" is there,' he says, and smiles."

Amazing. I can't think of why I'm screaming myself happy right now, thinking about Mikaela. :-)

Sure, I love the TV-series "Twin Peaks", but I haven't watched it more than 1 time, going through the series time after time like an effing demon, feeling like I'm having pie with Agent Cooper while masturbating. Or similar. Well, all people are different, right?

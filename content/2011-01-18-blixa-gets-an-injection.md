She's alright! By injection I mean _yearly, planned_ shot. Ha.

We walked to [Regionsdjursjukhus Bagarmossen](http://www.djursjukhusen.se/Page433.aspx), a nearby pet hospital. Blixa fared very well, being stuffed into her travelling case with a couple of blankets keeping her warm. It's a fairly warm night. No sweat.

When the vet gave her a shot, it entailed no fuss. No nothing. No blood, even! Just a tiny hole where the needle had entered her neck. Blixa tried to see what the vet was doing just after puncture, and did nothing but look. Right afterwards she wanted to explore the room while I was nearly biting my fingernails as though she'd explode into a cloud of blood at any second. Yeah, I'm brave.

As you see, she (and her crinkled single whisker, visible on the left side of her nose) is doing great. As I write this, she lies on my chest cleaning herself. And all that's left from the syringe is a tiny red mark.

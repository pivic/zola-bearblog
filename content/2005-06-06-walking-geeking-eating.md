We went out walking, but I had to interrupt that session due to my allergies; pollen is abound in the air around our neighbourhood due to loads of trees. It's usually not a problem for me, as long as I take my medicine before venturing out, but naturally, I'd forgotten about that. On the way back I tried out [Hitchhiker](http://www.kasuei.com/hitchhiker), a nifty little program for the Pocket PC, allowing anybody with a Pocket PC and wireless connection to try and hitch a ride on somebody's wireless connection, i.e. leech off their internet connection. I downloaded e-mail, sync'ed my AvantGo profile and sent [this picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/17787004) to flickr. Very geeky indeed.

When at home, I flopped down in our balcony chair and enjoyed the weather. After a while Mikaela came home, turned on [the first Röyksopp album](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/r/royksopp/melody-am.shtml) for the third time this week-end. At first I said "Please, put something else on, anything!" to which she snarled "Määä!" She was, of course, right. It's a great album.

Mikaela then made dinner, using her own spices, cutlets, sprouts, whole-wheat pasta, tomatoe sauce and I added the wine, a [Jean-Marc Brocard](http://www.brocard.fr) Chablis Fourchaume Premier Cru 2002, which I highly recommend.

The counting of votes in Ohio has been interrupted because of technical difficulties, and next week 250000 votes which have been mailed in are to be included in the total number of votes. Yes, this seems like yet another set-back for democracy.

And what a coincidence. Yesterday, when the US election started for real, was the [Dia de los Muertos](http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dead/history), the "Day of the Dead". How symbolic. At the same time, gay marriages were outlawed in Georgia, Kentucky, North Dakota, Ohio and Oklahoma.

Oh yeah! You who GNOME can now use an applet to display the current "Homeland Security Threat Level". Check it [here](http://tech9.net/rml/log/2004110201).

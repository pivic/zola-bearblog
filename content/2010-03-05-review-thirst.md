**SPOILER ALERT**! Don't read on unless you're prepared for some spoilers.

I think this film had a lot beneath its shell. Besides the apparent connections with "[Oldboy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/ "Oldboy")" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the [vampiric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire "Vampire"), physical action.

The main actor, [Kang-ho Song](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0814280/ "Song Kang-ho"), is terrific in the rà´le of the priest Sang-hyeon - coincidentally, "sang" means "blood" in some languages - who truly loved Tae-ju, played by Ok-bin Kim. Their relationship reminds me a lot of that between [Martin Sheen](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000640/ "Martin Sheen") and [Sissy Spacek](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000651/ "Sissy Spacek") in "[Badlands](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069762/ "Badlands (film)")", where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger.

Their relationship is one thing, but the girl's mother is entirely different. While moving, she is stiff, one-dimensional and taut, but paralysed, she says all through not moving, or through the wink of an eye.

Park-wook has really, really mastered his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to [Stanley Kubrick](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/ "Stanley Kubrick"); there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.

The music is quite stock, using mostly strings to accompany the main thespian's monoreaction; it's a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is. While he does very little and loses at that, he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot. While his love-interest says and does a lot, her actions display very little thought behind it. In my humble opinion.

All in all, a very disturbing film that is not made for action, which isn't even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days; it's magnificent, and repellant at the same time. It - thankfully - doesn't delve into religion too much either.

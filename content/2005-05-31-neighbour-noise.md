Our upstairs neighbour is busy making noise again, [like before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=265). As I've reported before, he's nearly deaf and likes to wake up early in the morning; he doesn't turn his radio alarm clock off unless at least 20 minutes have passed. He won't open the door when I come a-knockin', either. What a [recreant](http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2005/05/31.html).

A mate just tipped me about [this little CD](http://wishingfish.com/revengecd.html) as revenge. Even though I won't use it, it looks promising; at least if you wish to spring war on your neighbourhood. When I lived with my parents, our then upstairs neighbours were practically insane. One of their kinks was to play [Snap](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:k82gtq7ztu47)'s "[The Power](http://www.elyrics4u.com/t/the_power_snap.htm)" at any given moment, and I'm not exaggerating in the least, when I claim they probably played that track over 500 times in three years. No joke. I retorted by waiting until my parents left the house, picked up our amps, placed them against the ceiling and played Guns 'n' Roses' "Welcome To The Jungle" off their album "[Appetite For Destruction](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:5mf3zfjheh8k)" a few times in a row. We never became friends, but that's another, very long, story.

Anyway, I'll probably knock on his door a few times more before it's time to speak to the board that takes care of such problems. The very board that Mikaela's now a member of, moaha.

Words (and a phrase) that I've pondered during the past week ((Now, let the title of this post take you [hither](http://www.lyricsdepot.com/the-bee-gees/words.html).)):

- **ubiquitous**. present, appearing or found everywhere.
- **limbic system**. a complex system of nerves and networks in the brain, involving several areas near the edge of the cortex concerned with instinct and mood. It controls the basic emotions (fear, pleasure, anger) and drives (hunger, sex, dominance, care of offspring).
- **trite**. \[of a remark, opinion, or idea\] overused and consequently of little import; lacking originality or freshness.
- **placid**. not easily upset or excited.
- **perpendicular**. extremely steep.
- **abscond**. leave hurriedly and secretly, typically to avoid detection of or arrest for an unlawful action such as theft.
- **habitual line-stepper**. One who constantly steps over "the line" whatever that line may be.

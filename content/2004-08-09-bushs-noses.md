[Here](http://www.slumdance.com/blogs/brian_flemming/archives/000631.html) are a few lovely pictures of George W. Bush's plastic noses through time. That doesn't make him and/or his government bad, though. [This](http://www.misleader.org) does.

Even yucky David Letterman had something good to say about this \[audio evidence [here](http://homepage.mac.com/brianflemming/iblog/movies/letterman--bush_nose_job.mp3), MP3, 90KB\]:

> Here now is my favorite story of the week: a rumor that President George Bush had a nose job, that he had some kind of plastic surgery, he actually had a nose job. And I was thinking, well, if this is true it would be the first new job he's created since taking office.

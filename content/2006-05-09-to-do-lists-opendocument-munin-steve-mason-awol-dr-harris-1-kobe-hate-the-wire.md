Finding a good online to-do list would be as hard as turning "Knight Rider" into film...hang on, [it's being made](http://shoeblogs.com/wordpress/2006/05/09/the-dream-realized)! The downside: Miramax makes it. Anyway, TechCrunch has stepped up the game with [this good article](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/05/08/do-more-online-to-do-lists-compared) on available online to-do lists. Their winner is [Tadalist](http://www.tadalist.com), a free online to do-list which is simple, neatly built and easy to maintain; check a film of the interface (QuickTime, appx. 1MB in size) [here](http://www.tadalist.com/theater). I'm still happy with how 30 Boxes works with their newly introduced to do-list. They don't have a little film showing how to do it, so I made one to show you how it works, right [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-05-09-todo/todo-list.htm) (flash, 240KB). Give or take a few misguided clicks, it shows the functionality. It looks as though 30 Boxes is here to [stick around](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/story/0,,1769850,00.html).

Speaking of lists, [mynoteIT](http://www.mynoteit.com) looks like a good list-maker for students.

It looks as if we will be able to [use OpenDocument-files in MS Office 2007](http://news.com.com/2100-1013_3-6069188.html) after all. Wonderful.

Thanks to [this guide](http://www.howtoforge.com/server_monitoring_monit_munin) I installed Munin today, to check how it monitors activity from my Ubuntu machine. Worked wonderfully, monitoring a lot of stuff out of the box. It's quite like OP5.

Steve Mason, former frontman of [Beta Band](http://www.betaband.com), [has vanished utterly, by his own will](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1769940,00.html). The debut album from [King Biscuit Time](http://www.astralwerks.com/kingbiscuit/nostyle.html), Mason's latest moniker, is out on Monday, and the planned tour is now cancelled. It appears that Mason has quit music altogether, but let's hope that's not the case.

![Arlington Bath & Shower Gel](https://secure.metronet.co.uk/drharris/acatalog/Arlbath100.JPG)I've got to lay a lot of love on D.R. Harris. I first came across them when I purchased their [Arlington Bath & Shower Gel](https://secure.metronet.co.uk/drharris/acatalog/Arlington_Range.html) at Nitty Gritty, but as they no longer seem to care to re-stock D.R. Harris-products (at least not re-stocking any of their products that have gone out of stock for the past three months, as far as I have seen), I decided to use the D.R. Harris site instead.

Even though the menu-system of the site itself is a bit of a hindrance, it's all forgotten once you know the following. First, I could have my products within three weeks. Fair enough, I thought, until I received my stuff yesterday, less than an entire week (week-end included) after ordering them. Second, the products were _really_ carefully packaged. We're talking a package embedded _inside another package_, filled with foamy bits to protect the, er, gel.

The next time I'm definitely ordering more. This is delivery and service at its peak, when having ordered something online. I just hope they keep the great work up.

The only thing that makes me merry about the film based on the book "The Da Vinci Code" is that [it's ruffling catholic feathers](http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1770878,00.html). Will christians start bringing movie-studios to court because of this? I hope so. It's like [hating Kobe Bryant](http://www.slate.com/id/2141287): even though he's everywhere (even though Steve Nash and his hoods kicked Laker-ass very recently in the play-offs) he's still worthy of hate. By the way, you have to read [that article](http://www.slate.com/id/2141287), even if you loathe basketball.

Oh, I've just finished ["The Wire Season 2"](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=niklasblog-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0006IUD9Y)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1). I love that series. I _love_ that series. I haven't seen anything like it since I was totally into ["Twin Peaks"](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=niklasblog-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00005JKES)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1). True, with loads of thanks to [George Pelecanos](http://www.twbookmark.com/features/georgepelecanos/meet.html), it's very macho and even bordering on burlesque, but keeps quite tight due to a great cast, and a fantastic script. And [Omar](http://www.hobotrashcan.com/interviews/photos/mkw1.jpg "Cock of the walk, baby.") Rules.

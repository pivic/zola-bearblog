At 11:01 today, I received a call from the Vice President of inLife, the company that now cares for the repair of my MacBook - yes, the same company that is mentioned in [this unfortunate ordeal](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1059).

He had received an e-mail from [Oscar Bjers](http://itbranschen.idg.se/itfolk/person.asp?n=oscar_bjers&type=2), the Vice President of Apple Sweden, telling him about my problems.

See, when I was at my wit's end this week-end, I e-mailed Mr. Bjers and told him about my dilemmas with inLife, kindly directed him to my blog (the Mac/OSX-category, more specifically) and wrote him what I thought about my problems concerning my MacBook, especially being given the silent treatment from Apple, which does _not_ include their support people, who have handled this case with ease - even though they couldn't help me due to there [not being any solution to the shutdown-problem](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304308), the fact that it could occur again, et.c.

So, what now? I've just e-mailed the bulk of [this post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1059), i.e. my [Asperger](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/a-b/1166811.stm)\-ish list of problems when dealing with inLife, to the VP of inLife, and am awaiting further response. Kudos to him, he wanted it, which is a good step in managing customer relations.

As written, I have been told by inLife personnel that I will be contacted by a technician by Wednesday at the latest, regarding the status of my computer. I suppose that will be the next step.

**edit**: it will be interesting to see if there are [new MacBooks sprouting this Christmas](http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=2060), in which case Apple should have resolved the shutdown-issue (and all other major issues, one thinks).

**edit 2**: [Peter](http://tesugen.com) just sent me [this link](http://www.appledefects.com/?p=110), which displays a MacBook with the shutdown-problem, at an Apple store. Oh, _the humanity_.

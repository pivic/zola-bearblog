Mikaela has hooked up [our christmas lamp](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-11-28) in the living-room window. Also, I'm doing all (except for the stuffs I'm making myself) my shopping for 2004-12-24 over the net. How _very_ WWW indeed. Don't you hate it when you can't shop stuff from other countries because of limitations in their web ordering system? I can't imagine what the problem is, but in order to get a certain item, I'm forced to fax or call my order in, for some Yanks to send the stuff to us Suedeheads. Bah.

[This gallery](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-06-29) shows what went down yesterday evening, when Johan and I went a-drinking. I haven't been more hung over than today, I think. I actually forgot to eat dinner before drinking yesterday, which made me too drunk.

Above gallery also contains pictures of today's dinner, a very tasty salad Mikaela made. We recently received a big bottle of olive oil from Mikaela's dad, so we're covered on that area now.

So, we went to see "[War Of The Worlds](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407304)" today. Mikaela hurried and I, too, to the cinema. When there, the ticket guy tore my stub off, said "hang on" and looked a little closer at the ticket. It was valid, and the film was to start in five minutes - on the other side of town. I'd booked tickets for the wrong cinema. There you go. 180 crowns shot to hell, but we will see that film, even if it is a total b-movie (which I'm hoping it is).

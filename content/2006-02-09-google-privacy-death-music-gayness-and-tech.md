I like desktop search-and-indexing software, like [Copernic Search](http://www.copernic.com), [AppRocket](http://www.candylabs.com/approcket) and even lesser ones, like [Colibri](http://colibri.leetspeak.org), but [Google Desktop 3.0](http://desktop.google.com) is insanity. Check out this little piece, courtesy of themselves:

> In order to share your indexed files between your computers, we first copy this content to Google Desktop servers located at Google. \[...\] We store this data temporarily on Google Desktop servers and automatically delete older flies, and your data is never accessible by anyone doing a Google search.

Well, I'm actually more interested in what Google want to be doing to and with my data. Selling it? Using it for marketing strategies, or increasing [its relations with China](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/4587622.stm)?

More about [this at TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/02/08/google-desktop-new-version-tonight).

To more happy events, [Alexander Hacke](http://www.koolarrow.com/artists/alexanderhacke.shtml) from [Einstürzende Neubauten](http://www.neubauten.org) has released a solo album, where he has collaborated with Caspar Brötzmann, Nils Wohlrabe and...Gianna Nannini?

Writing on music, [can we please, please get Sly Stone to come back to us for real](http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/13824849.htm)?

And to further things on music, Songbird is good, even if it's currently available for Windows only. It's a way to listen to music over the net, without even downloading and having to do with that. Check [this article at TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/02/07/songbird-to-launch-tonight) on it, including screen-shots.

Blizzard, the maker of the extremely popular online-game World of Warcraft, has now [issued an official apology](http://news.com.com/2061-10797_3-6037002.html) for threatening to ban a "gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender-friendly guild", saying they will "review policies". How nice.

Much like [Microsoft Snarf](http://research.microsoft.com/community/snarf), [Mailroom](http://www.sproutit.com) is a solution that wants to help with organising your e-mail according to importance. Unlike Snarf, Mailroom is a hosted service and hence runs via operating systems that aren't made by Microsoft. Snarf, on the other hand, operates on your own computer (requiring MS Outlook) and gives you free reign. [Mailroom wants pay](https://app.sproutit.com/choose_plan) (unless you pick their free service) but could be very interesting when running free.

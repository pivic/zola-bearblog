[![X and Lotta](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3582/3300361667_c051a536ca.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3300361667)So, obviously I'm still mad about Lotta. They go together like pie and pear ((I've no idea... I mean, they mix more than well.)) apart from the fact that Lotta bites at times to get our attention. She's a golden nugget in a sea of porcupine, or something like it. Soon enough we'll part ways but not before we've cuddled her to pieces so that she'll remember us more than enough until next time around!

I thought getting a cat might cool the feeling of how much I'd wanted one, but it's the other way around. My thoughts circle around [Blixa](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3257788704), the kitten we're getting next month. If you know me, you probably know how much I've been dreaming about a cat of my own, which since forever has been a dream, mostly as I'm allergic to all things furry. That's why we've borrowed [Lotta](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=lotta&w=44124300615%40N01). Since things have gone remarkably well - no allergical problems so far - we're purchasing a kitten. And I'm stoked.

I've become such a parent. You know, the type who's always showing off pictures and everything about the little critter. Here's a little film of Lotta that I shot today. She didn't talk much, which she usually does.

I'm pretty much possessed by [this track](http://pivic.com/bqTk5v) right now.

I've never been into Pavement, but there's this track, "_Shady Lane_" and maybe a couple more. I love how Stephen Malkmus sings, seemingly without a care in the world. And it's quite as close as I'll come to Silver Jews without them being around, either.

Pavement have recently reformed, at least for touring as far as I know.

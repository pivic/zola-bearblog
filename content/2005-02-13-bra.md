[It's snowing outside](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-02-13), and it's getting dark quickly. It's another winter, and I hate this; come, summer, come!

Yesterday we sang karaoke at Frederic's with Staffan and Patrik, and it was great. I'm so tired. I planned on writing more about it, but here's the message: it was mighty fun. P&S brought ham, a meat pie and other goodies. Frederic had wine and drinks. We brought pears and olives. That's class and generosity! We sang karaoke. "New songs" for the Xbox apparently means "Songs from America, and preferably not from this century." Well, they had added Spritney's "Toxic". Almost all of us sang it.

We then went home, S&P home to theirs and Frederic went on to Lino.

Today, I left our comfortable home to wade through snow and (not very) blistering cold, to go to work. Moving SQL-databases was a drag, but it definitely helps when you're working with somebody who's very good at what he does.

Oh, and don't forget to let [Kraft show you](http://www.jimgilliam.com/2005/02/walmart_and_kraft_celebrate_black_history_month.php) what intelligence is all about.

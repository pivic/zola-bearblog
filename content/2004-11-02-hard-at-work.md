My colleagues know how to play gently. Not. As Annekaisa placed a juggling ball on Kalle's head, he picked it up and effectively hit her in the eye from a distance of 10 meters, as [this film](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/200411021459_00015.mp4) \[1,1MB, MP4, QuickTime-compatible\] shows. Bullseye!

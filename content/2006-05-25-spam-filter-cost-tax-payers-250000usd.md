[This story](http://www.theinternetpatrol.com/email-wrongly-trapped-by-spam-filter-costs-school-district-250000) caught my eye:

A man competes in a bidding-war on who gets to provide a new telephone system to the Cobb County school system in Georgia, e-mails his bid - which is appx. 250000USD lower than the closest competitor - but is ousted from the bidding due to his e-mail getting snagged by the recipient's spam filter. Hence, the tax-payers have to pay a quarter of a million US Dollars due to this error. Horrible shizz. But it's actually worse than that. From said article:

> And to add insult to injury, the Cobb County school system is blaming Russell for the fact that his email got trapped by their spam filter! \[...\] Cobb County schools' finance director Robert Morales blames Russell, saying that “someone seeking a substantial contract with a public agency should be able to outwit a program designed to catch pornographers.“

Horrid idiocy.

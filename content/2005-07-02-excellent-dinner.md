This evening Sebastian and Ebelinda came over and had dinner at our place. Mikaela made a great oven-baked salmon, which baked together with a salad mainly consisting of olives, tomatoes and green beans. To this we had a cool and fresh yoghurt-based dressing with garlic; I'd made hummus, also complete with garlic. Apart from that we ate two different Saltå breads ([biodynamically](http://www.biodynamics.com/biodynamics.html) produced) and finished the meal off with a lovely plum pie that contained pecan pistachio nuts and was based on a lot of butter and almond nuts. Honestly, it's one of the best pies I've ever had. We ate it with a Lejonet & Björnen ice-cream called "Italian vanilla", which suited it perfectly. The plums in the pie added a bitter-sweet taste to what the tangy pecan and almond nuts brought to the table. Mmm-good.

We then watched a couple of episodes of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and then just collapsed. I snapped a few pictures of the great company and also of our most recent addition to our nest: a lamp for our balcony. [Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-07-02)'s the picture gallery from tonight!

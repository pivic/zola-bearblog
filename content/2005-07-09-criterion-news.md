[Criterion](http://www.criterionco.com) has a great newsletter out from now on, in which you'll get first-hand info on coming releases that are not even written about on their site. I caught notice that "[The Harder They Come](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=83)" starring Jimmy Cliff, is set to go _out of print_ in September; if you haven't seen it - you must. The acting is a bit learn-as-we-go-along, but the story and the music is good. The photography is sometimes great, but altogether it's a very good film. Music has a big part of it, and this film's the one that made reggae known world-wide.

Another person who's got to do with music is David Bowie. He starred in Nicolas Roeg's "[The Man Who Fell To Earth](http://www.davidbowie.com/news/index.php?id=20050706)", which is since long available (or rather, hard to get) on Criterion laserdisc, but will in September be released on [a double-DVD](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=304) including Bowie's comments. I don't know if the comments will be better than the film itself, but I guess so; what little I've seen of said film implies more of experimentation than of artistic success.

Mike Leigh's "Naked" is a film I've heard loads about, and now that it's [coming out Criterion](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=307) (in September) I'm going to get it. People have always stated that I have to see it; Mikaela doesn't think it's a masterpiece, but as the only film I've seen by Leigh is "[Secrets And Lies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117589)", I'm eager to see more.

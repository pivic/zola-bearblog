Somehow, I envisioned Atreyu riding on Falcor above the clouds would make for a brilliant video to this track, Destroyer's "_Savage Night at the Opera_", but a motorbike's not bad. And the end is so very sweet.

I can't imagine having seen Destroyer live, but...I did just a few weeks ago. It's so strange. The music was so ethereal ((In the true, non-I'm-a-Pitchfork-reviewer-who-has-to-use-words-like-that sense of the word.)) that the entire gig seems to not have happened anywhere but inside my head.

This is Arcade Fire live that I shot during [Popaganda 2011](https://niklasblog.com/?p=8099); the sound is awfully distorted but is to me more valuable than their studio albums. I don't know why, but the live show was brilliant and their recorded music isn't quite up there, to me.

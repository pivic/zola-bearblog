I've found a way to read blogs and other types of RSS'ed-out info on the Pocket PC 2003. The program is called RSS Sync and is free. [Here](http://www.viksoe.dk/code/rsssync.htm) you'll find what the author of the program calls "a Pocket PC 2003 ActiveSync Extension. It synchronizes RSS/RDF news to your PDA - effectively creating an offline newsreader."

Fair enough! But what about its features? The author says it "reads all known versions of RSS / RDF / Atom" and that it imports OPML files, too. Perfect! I haven't been able to get it to read Atom feeds, and it won't accept my blog-feed (which may be a timeout-question) but it's simple and small.

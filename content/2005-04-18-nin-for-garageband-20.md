Nine Inch Nails has released [this 70MB file](http://boss.streamos.com/download/interscope/nin/with_teeth/nin_garageband.sit) which consists of elements off a song from the new NIN album, "With Teeth". This means that all of you sitting on Macintosh computers running GarageBand 2.0 can make your own mix. Let me know of yours.

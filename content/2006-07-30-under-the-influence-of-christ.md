![Godhead](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-07-30-gibson.jpg)Wow! Messiah on Earth (kaplaah!) has been hit with [drunk driving](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5228050.stm). I guess that was because of too much wine during his [christian consumation of the actual body of christ](http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=communion), but he can always amend his way by saying I'm sorry to a priest, and all his sins are absolved. From the article, courtesy of the BBC:

> Gibson said he "acted like a person completely out of control" when he was arrested and said things "that I do not believe to be true and which are despicable".

Hm. Liar. People who aren't in control to stuff like [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=niklasblog-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00029QWII). All he has to do is [never, ever ponder on whether the holy ghost really exists or not](http://www.raptureready.com/resource/robinson/br22.html), like every christian has to.

**edit**: Could things get worse? Every sane person who has been insane enough to see "The Passion Of The Christ" (myself sadly included, albeit more demented than others) knows Gibson doesn't like jews (neither does his dad, which is a deal [he's spoken out for](http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/02/19/1077072756433.html)), but now [the details](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1833963,00.html) regarding this arrest have really put him in the lime-light:

> The report says: "Gibson blurted out a barrage of anti-semitic remarks about 'fucking Jews'. Gibson yelled out: 'The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.' Gibson then asked: 'Are you a Jew?'"
> 
> The incident gained further attention when it was alleged that the LA police department had tried to cover up Gibson's offensive remarks.

So, the police department help Gibson? Even if they're not, it's still immensely interesting. Who will [follow Gibson](https://niklasblog.com/?p=498) now?

**edit 2**: [Mr. Intelligent has now admitted](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5234142.stm) that he made anti-jewish remarks. From the article, courtesy of _the BBC_:

> Please know from my heart I am not an anti-Semite. I am not a bigot. Hatred of any kind goes against my faith.

Two things go against these three short sentences.

**1**. He made "The Passion Of The Christ", which is a gore-fest and very much against jews. See it, and even _try_ to feel somebody isn't trying to make jews into stereotypes (not to mention killers of Jesus of Arameia).

**2**. Mel is christian. From Sam Harris "The End Of Faith", page 92:

> Anti-semitism (( \[from Harris' book:\] "Anti-Semitism," like the term "Aryan," is a misnomer of ninteenth century German pseudo-science. _Semitic_ (derived from _Shem_, one of Noah's three sons) "designated a group of cognate languages that included Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic, Babylonian, Assyrian and Ethiopic, not an ethnic or racial group." See R. S. Wistrich, _Anti-Semitism: The Longest Hatred_ (New York: Schocken Books, 1991), xvi. "Anti-Semitism" should therefore denote a hatred of Arabas as well, which it does not. Despite its mistaken roots, "anti-Semitism" has become the only acceptable term for the hatred of Jews.)) is as integral to church doctrine as the flying buttress is to a Gothic cathedral, and this terrible truth has ben published in Jewish blood since the first centuries of the common era. Like that of the Inquisition, the history of anti-Semitism can scarcely be given sufficient treatment in the context of this book.

Apart from the simple fact that religion and money are the most significant threats to peace - and, indeed, the most significant bringers of war today and for the past two millennia - here's a little quote from the book Mel surely keeps at his side whenever he is not tempted by Satan:

> If your brother, the son of your father or of your mother, or your son or daughter, or the spouce whom you embrace, or your most intimate friend, tries to secretly seduce you, saying, "Let us go and serve other gods," unknown to you or your ancestors before you, gods of the peoples surrounding you, whether near you or far away, anywhere throughout the world, you must not consent, you must not listen to him; you must show him no pity, you must not spare him or conceal his guilt. No, you must kill him, your hand must strike the first blow in putting him to death and the hands of the rest of the people following. You must stone him to death, since he has tried to divert you from Yahweh your God... (( Deuteronomy 13:7-11))

And don't forget, if you're a christian, you cannot and must not divert from that (or anything else that's in the bible):

> Whatever I am now commanding you, you must keep and observe, adding nothing to it, taking nothing away. (( Deuteronomy 13:1))

Hence, either Mel's not reading his bible or he's just lying. Or has he joined scientology and I just don't know about it?

**edit 3**: thanks to the Internet, people are prone to share [mash-ups](http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=mash-up). [Here](http://www.slumdance.com/blogs/brian_flemming/archives/002254.html)'s one where Mel's passion is displayed, in streaming QuickTime.

**edit 4**: [Jodie Foster says Mel's "kind"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/2/hi/entertainment/5248516.stm). I just hope her definition of being kind is never extended to me.

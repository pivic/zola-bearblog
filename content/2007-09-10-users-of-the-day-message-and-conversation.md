I do receive quite some strange calls when I answer an emergency phone at work. People with IT-problems call, and we respond.

**The message**

This morning a user had left a message on my mobile phone; no name, telephone number or other identifying information was recorded. Here's the translated transcript:

> Yes, hey, Niklas...you are IT support now...IT department's temp corridor...well, I...you're biggest in IT, right...security...government authority...control. Security unit's security for government authority. Control of security of...I myself build filter for the numbers...object.

**The conversation**

I: IT Department, Niklas speaking. User: Hello! I just called to tell you that I reported a case a month back, where I wanted help, but you never called me back; why is that? I: Hello! I recognise your voice and I remember your case; you _had_ left your telephone number, but when I called back I heard an automatic reply saying that your number was suspended for incoming calls. U: Yeah! I: ...yes; that's why we haven't been able to reply. You didn't leave your name or any other type of information that could help us to reach you, so we couldn't find you. U: Oh. I: But now that you've called again, I'm sure I can help you out! Did you-- U: But...why didn't you just call me?

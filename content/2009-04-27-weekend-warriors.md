This weekend was filled with fun stuff, like [Erika](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3396869760/) showing up to see the extended version of "[Sex And The City](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1000774/)" with X and me. The film suffered immensely the second time around. As a series, it's good. As a film, it was extremely jumpy and fragmented. And what about that valiumed-out child that Charlotte tugged around? God damn! Did the caterers feed her space cake during the entire shoot? Lucky brat. Anyway, it was great having Erika with her ludicrously brilliant personality over, drinking wine and other alcoholic beverages. Blixa wouldn't leave her alone.

Speaking of children, X and I visited my sister and her kids on Saturday! We grilled soy sausages, halloumi and had hummous with it...mmmm-good. That bloody grill took ages to get going! I had to douse the fucking thing in accelerants to get it flaming while [X](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3475200851/) and [Katharina](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3476007744/) laughed at my attempts at being macho and shit. Basically missing the point. If it had been up to me, I'd have thrown a bucket of napalm into it...making everything grilled taste like lighter fluid. Mmm-good. But I didn't, and thank Bog for that. Here there be pics.

When we got home we watched two films, "[Confessions Of A Shopaholic](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1093908)" that earned a whole 1/10 in my book for being a disgrace upon everything and "[Juno](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406)" that I give 5/10; the latter was quite OK, but at times strained because of the screen-writer's ability to try too hard to make a slow, alternative film. _Dario Argento is not mee_.

Yesterday X and I ventured to IKEA armed with money and nothing else. We bagged new bowls for the kitties, frames for pictures on our walls, new flowers and additional stuffs that make us smile. Our home is a sanctuary, I tells you. I wouldn't trade it for the world. I can find myself walking about the kitsch and the solemn atmospheres that vary from room to room, and sometimes from part of a room to another part of it, like in our partly gold-tiled bathroom. Gold, baby. Well, decor tiling actually, but I'm not [Saparmurat Niyazov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saparmurat_Niyazov#Unusual_decrees_and_laws) so I can't bling out like that.

I did get to use the wonderful semi-automatic ice-cream machine at IKEA; you buy a cone and place it in a machine which allows you to get an industrial-sized cone. This is Sweden in a nut-shell, especially if you can imagine people standing in a line to get their product like this.

That's what I'm talking about! Yeah!

Another thing that I love is that X and I have started to make dinner more exciting by experimentation, more than I think we usually get into. This weekend we've made cookies, chocolate cake, used hummous, orange-and-carrot dip, grilled vegetables in the oven...yummy! I'm getting hungry by writing about it. I'm not saying I'm a crafted chef - anybody who has ever tasted any thing I've made _knows_ I'm not - but I must say that I think simple cooking is just the best there is; using fresh, great produce and simple cooking-techniques is the way to go. Wee! I'm not into molecular gastronomy. I'd say the Italian kitchen appeals the most to me, in its simplistic beauty. Damn, I'm really hungry now. Gotta rush.

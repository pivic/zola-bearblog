[![DSC_0005](http://static.flickr.com/43/107580224_67a55d96ca_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=107580224) It's snowing in Stockholm. Need it be said? Piles and piles of the white stuff is coming down from the heavens (pun intended) as truck after truck runs by mowing snow out of the way, distributing sand along the way. I took that picture of myself just as I came home, having walked a few hundred meters, and [here](http://www.vimeo.com/clip=51549)'s a little video I snapped along the way, for all you meteorologists out there.

I like when it's snowing, and this is just too much! I met our next-door neighbour along the way, who was wearing a Missy Elliott-sized puffy jacket with hood, and there was so much snow clogging her face she had to remove the hood. We just laughed at it all.

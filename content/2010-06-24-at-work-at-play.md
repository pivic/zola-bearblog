While partying last Saturday, I met a guy who went "Hey, you!" and I actually knew his face, but...hang on...he's the guy who interviewed me for a job I was interested in a few months back! I was actually offered the job, but no-thanked them.

Back then, he was quite quick to the touch, engaged and professional. Here, he'd let his hair down, ready to party in the industrial (not metaphorically, musically speaking) part of Stockholm where house flowed out of a huge building, strangely enough surrounded by bikers.

**He**: Why didn't you accept the job? **Me**: Well...to begin with, it seemed not to have structure, and the job-hours were seemingly infinite. **He**: Hell yeah! Today I work somewhere else. That place was a real shit-hole. **Me**: And you tried to recruit me to come work there! **He**: That was my job, wasn't it?

We laughed.

It's strange but fun to meet people outside their office exterior. Or rather, to meet their interior.

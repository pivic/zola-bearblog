I had a cup of coffee at about 6 pm yesterday which wasn't very smart. I feel as though there are ants creeping around inside me as I've tried to go to sleep twice, but I'm happy that my love's lying in bed, sleeping soundly while I'm perusing the Internet.

I'm still missing MCA. It's actually harder than I thought it would be, which sounds strange, I know, but I've always thought "what happens when one of the Beastie Boys die?" and at the same time I've been entertaining the thought of "they're just musicians whom I've never met" but fuck that, it's all a matter if somebody's of any meaning to you. And the Beastie Boys have always been of meaning to me - even if _stupid fresh_ and _stupid correct_ have been those meanings at times.

I don't especially love the shoes that Justin from Bon Iver has designed for a company called Keep, but I do like the orange moggie who apparently likes the shoes. I'd love to feel like that cat right now and not as though electrical current were running through my veins.

I'll be listening to Ride's "_Nowhere_" today. I haven't listened to it in years. I remember it like drowning in a wave of guitars, and I remember that the album cover really gave away their sound without me having heard it, the first time I saw it. On the other hand: [My Bloody Valentine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bloody_Valentine_%28band%29) and [their newly remastered old albums](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16605-isnt-anything-reissue-loveless-reissue-eps-1988-1991):

Ted Saskin, senior director of the NHL Players Association, recently said the following to [Svenska Dagbladet](http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/sport/did_7861367.asp) \[my translation\]: "We do not have any problems with steroids in the NHL."

That's probably correct. Proper useage of steroids = no problem using them! He adds that no testing for steroids will be in the NHL.

That's a f-ing definition of _non-presumptive_ for you.

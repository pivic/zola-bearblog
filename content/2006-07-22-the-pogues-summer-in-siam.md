This is one of the more tranquil tracks off the soundtrack to "[Basquiat](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115632)", which really caught me, and, hopefully, this will turn heads who seem to think [The Pogues](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:61l67ue0h0jj) were all about Irish folk-music rather than crafting intelligent lyrics and great music.

As usual, the track will merely be available for a week.

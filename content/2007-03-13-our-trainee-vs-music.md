![Andy Rourke, then and now.](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-03-13-rourke.jpg)For little more than a week now, my dear colleagues and I have put Victor to work. What's Victor? Nay! Don't say that ((Even though _everybody_ does.)); he's a human being. We think. Anyway, it's reached a ripe 18 years of age, is eager to know stuff ((Especially what's to know about downloading music, films, et.c.)) and not afraid to face new experiences. Just the qualities every aspiring young technician needs to get a good foot in the door of this profession - but what's become of his work so far? Important stuff.

For instance, this past Friday he and I walked down [Götgatan](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/32624649) while talking about music. It went down like this:

Victor: ...and then I started listening to rock music. me: OK, so what bands did you get into? V: Well...a few different bands, but I really got into [Håkan Hellström](http://www.hakanhellstrom.com) ((Fairly known throughout Sweden as a kleptomaniac, stealing lyrics, mainly off Morrissey.))-- M: What the fuck, man! And you still haven't started listening properly to [Morrissey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey) or [The Smiths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smiths)? V: Well, no, but-- M: Listen, you _have_ to. You know Håkan always rips off other artists and never pays his dues, right? V: But, Håkan has admitted to stealing-- M: By the way, look there. There's the bassist in the best pop band ever.

[Andy Rourke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Rourke) comes strolling down Götgatan.

M: Of course, this is an omen saying you should stop listening to crap music. V: Oh, who's that, you said? M: _An omen_! Andy Rourke, the bassist in The Smiths! Start listening to good music, damn you! V: I can't say I like The Smiths' lyrics: they're too intelligent. M: I swear I'd like to curse you off the planet right now. God _damn_ it. Håkan fucking Hellström.

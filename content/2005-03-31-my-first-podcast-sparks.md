![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-31-niklassparks.jpg)[This](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-31-podcast-sparks.mp3) \[23.8MB (!), 26min17sec, MP3, LAME VBR ~128Kbps\], is the first podcast I've ever made. It's a narrated journey through [Sparks](http://www.allsparks.com), one of my favourite bands. They've excelled throughout the ages, continually (except during the 80's when they sucked - although their album with Giorgio Moroder's basically a masterpiece) making albums that count, using wonderful melodies, a great sonic landscape and enough great songs to fill a couple of best-of-collections with (which they've done). Do observe that my podcast on Sparks is merely a personal blip of space, and not a chronological biography. I haven't really covered any of their 80's work nor "Li'l Beethoven", I'm afraid. Yes, next time I'll script the cast before podding it. Eh. You get it, I'm sure.

If you're wondering what the blazes a podcast is, check this little explanation courtesy of [iPodder](http://ipodder.sourceforge.net), which is the podcast software I recommend you use:

To use it, do as follows:

1\. Download the software. 2. Install and open it. 3. Configure the program to use [http://podcast.niklasblog.com](http://podcast.niklasblog.com).

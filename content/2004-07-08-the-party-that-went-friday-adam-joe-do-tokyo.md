Last Friday I DJ'ed at Micke's party, yeah, almost forgot to tell you about that.

Micke came by to pick me up, just after I'd showered and burned my last CD for the evening, and drove us to the boat that the party was on. When we arrived, Micke was scared that none of his friends had arrived. The band was there though, and had almost finished sound-checking when we popped in. They were a nice bunch of people, unitedly called [Silverbug](http://www.listen.to/silverbug), playing a sort of mash between Motörhead and Ramones.

Anyway, the other DJ started playing at 22:00 or something like that, and no people had turned up. We were to take turns at playing and we did, so he did the first hour. I drank a few beers with Micke and his friends, who were quite scared that I didn't have any Misfits in my DJ bag. Of course I didn't, but a couple of SMS's later, Micke's brother, Sebastian, would bring one. No prob, and later he showed. Naturally, I was all too distracted to even play a single Misfits track, but what the hell, that didn't stop the other DJ to try and steal my records!

That's right! During the first hour of the gig, when he played, I heard a couple of songs played from a couple of my records. It's interesting, when I was going to play my first hour after his, I found two of my CD's missing. That's nice, isn't it? I asked the lad whether or not he might have happened to have put them in his CD collection, and well, maybe he had, and I checked, and - ta-raah - there they were.

I played a little Slayer, Ramones, Beastie Boys and a few other stuffs, before said DJ returned to the booth to lower the volume without asking me whether or not that'd be OK. I let the volume be lowered as I quickly realised he was right - even though he was being a putz about how he let me know - as the DJ set was connected through the band's PA. As I couldn't take the volume, I had to wear ear-plugs (I guess you can see where this is going), to block the veritable wall of sound produced by Marshall-stacks behind me. Well, anyway, after another DJ-swap, I found three other records missing. When I asked the smallish Justin Timberlake-hat-wearing little man where those records might have gone, he irritatedly said he didn't know. I asked him whether I could check his bag or not, he said hello, and lo and behold - it contained the three beforementioned, missing CD's!

On my little leave I noted Micke and Sebastian were getting happily drunk, quite fast. Faster than I, anyway! We had words, I called San Diego and New York and then Silverbug started playing. They were fast, hard and tight, much like silver beetles. Anyway, Micke and Sebastian stagedove at different times and we moshed until it was my time at the wheels of semi-plastic.

Of course, two records were missing. I asked the little suspect figurine whether or not he thought a couple of my records might had been stolen by dwarves who had placed them in their Big Bag O' Stolen CD's or if they might possibly be placed in his little bag, and more irritably, he invited me to check his bag. There they gleamed. “Harr! Mine!", I said, and returned them to their right places.

After dancing around a little, I returned to the floor to find four entire records missing! When explaining this to the fellow fairie full-excrement-flavoured fuksak next to me, he opened his record bag himself, went through “his“ collection in circa 10 seconds, actually stroking every page as he went through it - and that's fast work - and after that, I asked if I could rummage through his surely empty supply of records, and “Sure.“ I could, but not without an arty sigh. I went through it and, well, yes, I found four of my records. I then left the place for home. Wee!

Anyway, most other people were really nice and young.

I've just finished watching [Adam & Joe Go Tokyo](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/tv/adam_and_joe.shtml), a BBC series featuring two Englishmen reporting on all things Japanese. Mostly pop things, but the lads who are the front-men have charisma and (mostly) humor, so go catch it if you can. Through that series I've among other things discovered this:

Boris' “[Ibitsu](http://homepage1.nifty.com/boris/gallery/streaming/streaming.html)“, Miike's “[Blue Spring](http://imdb.com/title/tt0309291)“, [S-Word](http://www.mtvtop.net/html1/4606.htm) and the thing about “Get's", a (then, when the show was being made, anyhow) game very similar to scissor, paper rocks.

By the way, [here](http://www.ia-stud.hiof.no/~geirslan/Div/Mouse_Computer.jpg)'s a brutalised computer mouse.

Don't forget to check out [the following anti-corporation Korn video](http://www.blastro.com/player/kornyallwantasingle.html&artist=Korn?mediatype=rm&filename=kornyallwantasingle&artist=&bitrate=_300&mediatype=rm&x=17&y=5), which Rade tipped me on.

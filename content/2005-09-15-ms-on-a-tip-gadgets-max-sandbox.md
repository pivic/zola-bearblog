Microsoft is currently hosting a developer's conference, which means they're delivering weird MS stuff to the general public. In a way. [Here](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2005/sep05/09-13OfficeUI.mspx)'s a Microsoft-minted article about the coming version of MS Office, so far titelled Office 12, but don't feel like you're [Richard Sandrak](http://www.mymultiplesclerosis.co.uk/images/sandrak.jpg) if you're thinking Office 2006. Office Vista? Might be. There are a few pictures on the right-hand side of said article.

MS are also churning out [this page](http://microsoftgadgets.com), which is all about how they're going [Konfabulator](https://niklasblog.com/?p=713) and want to chew in on what Apple incorporated in [OSX Tiger](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard), i.e. the latest version of their operating-system for the Macintosh.

MS have opened [this site](http://sandbox.msn.com) where they present beta-versions and smallish programs, though very public stuff, i.e. not stuff that Fox Mulder's little nerd-friends want to hawk over, to the general public. I like [their new screen-saver](http://screensaver.msn.com), but I think that's "stolen" from Apple.

Another interesting program is their "[codename Max](http://www.microsoft.com/max)". It's a photo-handling program, designed either to be downloadable for free in Windows Vista, or it's going to be incorporated in it. A lot of people say it's a lot like Apple's [iPhoto](http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto), and I say it sucks so far. It's very simple, nothing wrong about that, but in order to share your photo gallery, you have to get your friends to install the program as well. And even though the minimum recommendations for said product are fairly high (e.g. you have to have WinXP with SP2 installed) the requirements-page failed to mention you have to have an English version of Windows, even if you can by-pass that as well. Check out [this comment](http://www.neowin.net/comments.php?category=main&id=30384#comment400165) a Neowin page if you're still nerdish enough to want to install it and are not running an English WinXP.

All in all, are MS creating new stuff, here? Well, I wonder. I just hope Windows Vista will be powerful and great. Great, did you hear that? And a great version of Office to boot. Please.

I was captured by [this article](http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/music/news/article353672.ece) from The Independent. I truly wonder if Duran Duran's "[Thank You](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:rnj9kectkq7c)" is worse than Naomi Campbell's "[Babywoman](http://www.discogs.com/release/148042)". I understand the killing of Lou Reed's "[Metal Machine Music](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:ib6uak4k5m3n)" but not how Kevin Rowland's "[My Beauty](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:ppev97qakrrt)" is treated! Songs like "Concrete And Clay" and "Daydream Believer" nearly sound better than the originals, and if you know Rowland's history, tracks like "The Greatest Love Of All" and "Labelled With Love (I'll Stay With My Dreams)" surpass the _bona fide_ in ways most covers by any artist ever does.

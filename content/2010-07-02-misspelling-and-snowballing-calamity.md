As I own the domain pivic.com, I sometimes get e-mail sent to me, that should really be adressed to pivec.com, some sort of Toyota dealership in the US of A.

I'll post the entire thread here, names and companies have been changed to protect the guilty parties. It's all posted in chronological order, oldest->newest, up->down. The last e-mail is the real kicker.

...and I didn't have time to reply until this dropped along:

> 
> Hilary- Any word re Toyota for tomorrow. We're close to our log-print for tomorrow. Thx, X

So, I felt an urgent need to reply.

What!? No e-mail storm back at me? The following was the only thing I received:

> NIKLAS- Hilary's traffic for tomorrow has not come through on email or fax. Can you send it? We're past deadline for our log print.

I had to reply in firmer terms, still. Damn you, corporate world!

After this I received an e-mail first stating this, chronologically speaking:

> From: X Sent: 2010-06-30 3:57 PM To: Y Subject: FW: FW: TOYOTA FOR 7/1?

> From: Y To: Z Sent: Wednesday, June 30, 2010 3:58:44 PM Subject: FW: FW: TOYOTA FOR 7/1?
> 
> We have an email problem; can you come here to help us?

...which was followed by this, in the same e-mail:

> LMAO! Thanks for the laugh!!! I suppose you'd have to know the guy (X) to truly understand, but when I went down there to try to understand what he was telling me, and after clearly seeing the misspelling of the domain name, and your response, I just about lost it laughing!
> 
> Anyway, you made my day!
> 
> Z Director of Information Technology

Now, that's a thing of true magic.

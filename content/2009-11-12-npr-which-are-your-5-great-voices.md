From [NPR](http://www.npr.org):

> In January 2010, NPR will launch a year-long exploration of 50 great voices in recorded history. The series isn't an attempt to catalog the so-called "greatest" singers. Instead, we hope to discover and re-discover awe-inspiring vocalists from around the world and across time.

This list has been whittled down a small cast of 50 to include some of my favourite singers, including [Morrissey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey "Morrissey"), [Maria Callas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Callas "Maria Callas") and [Elvis Presley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley "Elvis Presley"). There are soundbites available for every singer on the list (just click 'em to hear). The list is pretty American yet quite interesting from a pop perspective, in a way. I'm glad to see people like [Benjamino Gigli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beniamino_Gigli "Beniamino Gigli") and [Notorious B.I.G.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Notorious_B.I.G. "The Notorious B.I.G."), but where's [Jussi Björling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussi_Bj%C3%B6rling "Jussi Björling") and Rakim? Of course there will always be scrutiny when a list like this is published, and I won't yak further about my gripes. Instead I'll look into the voices I haven't heard much from, e.g. [Celia Cruz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celia_Cruz "Celia Cruz") and Milton Nascimento.

The picture at the top of this post includes my five faves of the bunch. So, tell me your truth: which are your five faves?

Check out the list and cast your vote [here](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114013402). I'm really looking forward to this series to start broadcasting.

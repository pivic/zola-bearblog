![Sarah Palins](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-09-31-palin.jpg)

Ooh! It's election time in the USA again! Well, in the beginning of November, but who cares? Well, I do, so shut the hell up and listen to this:

> I care even more about the many things Palin thinks she knows but doesn't: like her conviction that the Biblical God consciously directs world events.

Thus goes a little rant that Sam "The End of Faith" Harris has written about Sarah Palin, the American conservative party vice president, who puts her faith in the Lawd.

What I like about Harris is his ability to break religion down so that you react with your gut - just [like Stephen Colbert](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/24039/october-17-2005/the-word---truthiness) - although not like _oh, wow_! but rather _blizzow, this idiot has the power to unleash nuclear weapons on us_!

> You can learn something about a person by the company she keeps. In the churches where Palin has worshiped for decades, parishioners enjoy "baptism in the Holy Spirit," "miraculous healings" and "the gift of tongues." Invariably, they offer astonishingly irrational accounts of this behavior and of its significance for the entire cosmos. Palin's spiritual colleagues describe themselves as part of "the final generation," engaged in "spiritual warfare" to purge the earth of "demonic strongholds." Palin has spent her entire adult life immersed in this apocalyptic hysteria. Ask yourself: Is it a good idea to place the most powerful military on earth at her disposal? Do we actually want our leaders thinking about the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy when it comes time to say to the Iranians, or to the North Koreans, or to the Pakistanis, or to the Russians or to the Chinese: "All options remain on the table"?

Harris makes me laugh and cringe, and even goes through his trademark thing, like "ok, you're christian and you follow the bible word-for-word; I get that your life is being run according to old scripture that is full of contradictions and has no scientific proof to back the existence of an all-seeing, all-controlling diety, but you won't let a non-surgeon perform surgery on you?" The end says all:

> When asked why she is qualified to shoulder more responsibility than any person has held in human history, Palin cites her refusal to hesitate. "You can't blink," she told Gibson repeatedly, as though this were a primordial truth of wise governance. Let us hope that a President Palin would blink, again and again, while more thoughtful people decide the fate of civilization.

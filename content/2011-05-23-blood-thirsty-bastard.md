Right now I'm feeling like [this](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858585800) about somebody near me:

> I do my bit oh yes To cleanse my hands from lies I'm feeding up the zombies Hatched from their own eyes
> 
> And from these eyes The weary eyes-cum-shadows Of a very different man
> 
> Blood thirsty bastards making plans for no one But their own I got to be my own master Get away from these braggards, tricksters, foolish clones
> 
> Oh look at how they laugh at you now What did you do to make this bad become true For heavens sake Such a silly mistake You're a legend in your mind But a rumour in your room
> 
> They all followed me down here To an alley's dirty end Oh I had nothing to give them I just thought they were my friends Doesn't matter now I'm angry anyhow So its the best way I can deal with
> 
> Blood thirsty bastards Making plans for no one But their kind Only now do I see it I know I don't need it, no I pay them no mind

Fuck it, then. If several people have worked to get him something for free which he then doesn't give a fuck about, throws away, merrily discards with no reply as to where he's gone instead apart from sending nonsensical texts as replies to my serious questions... WHAT?

The day after I texted him and asked if something happened to him and then, not having replied to me even days after, _I_ ask him face to face what happened and he says he was arguing with a person. As if that excused his non-replies and _following_ braindead texts. I told him I could have sold his ticket and **not** have shelled out 40 USD on him, to which he answered: "Did you have fun?"

What the **Hell**? That's not even a _reply_. There are times to try and sort things out, but this is a clear-cut case of pearls for swine.

**Fuck him**. And, like Carl BarÃ¢t once sang:

> They all followed me down here To an alley's dirty end Oh I had nothing to give them I just thought they were my friends Doesn't matter now I'm angry anyhow So its the best way I can deal with
> 
> Blood thirsty bastards Making plans for no one But their kind Only now do I see it I know I don't need it, no I pay them no mind

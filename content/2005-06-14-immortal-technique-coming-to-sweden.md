[Immortal Technique](http://www.viperrecords.com/imtech/bio.shtml) 's making his Swedish debut at the [Hultsfred music festival](http:// www.rockparty.se/content/english). I just got this from IT's management:

> IMMORTAL TECHNIQUE LIVE!! June 17th @ Hultsfred Festival, 2005

Oh...I'm not jealous! Yeah, _I am_! Damn it. To all of you going: have fun! If IT ever should come to Stockholm, be sure I'll be there (and hopefully will get an interview somehow).

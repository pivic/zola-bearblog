Today we mounted Mikaela's new bathroom cabinet. [Here are a few pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-08-04-cabinet). She bought a cabinet from Indiska, re-painted it and then drilled holes for it in the bathroom. Here are a few pictures of how it looks. Beautiful! I wish I had her skills at renovating and fixing stuff up - I'm not at all interested though. I mean, I love the finished product, and she and I do have a very similar taste in things (although there are examples - she _loathes_ the way the new TV "fits into" the existing environment, which is something I do understand, but do not agree with) which makes living together very easy. I mean, she renovated the apartment in Märsta completely! She's the one who has made this apartment liveable. God damn, I would be living like a f-ed up bachelor still, if it wasn't for her.

It seems like forever ago that the sun last shone. Summer's being slowly yet harshly pelted away by raindrops and I can't help but yearn for our coming trip to the United States. You've got that right, [X](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com) and I are going to visit the US of A again, come autumn. I'm really, really looking forward to it. We plan to travel around Texas by car.

I'm settling for no tears, but hell to the yes to the Texan sun! Our Texan friends have all extended their warm welcomes as far as living-arrangements and debauchery is concerned.

Taking my regular, solitary lunch-walk around a lake called [Trekanten](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/4856241340/) is solemn. My headphones drown out most other sounds, and as such, I've walked around with [Magnetic Fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Magnetic%20Fields) ringing in my ears. Listening to their "Holiday" is fun. I've heard them a lot since re-discovering them for good at the start of this year, and now their eccentric and special sounds are everyday to me, in a sense. It's like listening to [Super Furry Animals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super%20Furry%20Animals) a _lot_, so much that you discover they're suddenly the norm and you wonder why all artists don't incorporate screaming, grand vocal harmonies, [303](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland%20TB-303)s and [a tank](http://pix-eu.dontstayin.com/1821be2b-5957-414b-90e0-8bdb685dc6dc.jpg) in their music.

Speaking of which, I'm itching to see "[_Inception_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception%20%28film%29)". I had high hopes for "[_Shutter Island_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter%20Island%20%28film%29)", but that film kinda fell through, like a shattered and strange version of the newer "_[Cape Fear](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101540/)_". I know very little of "_Inception_", but word-of-mouth from friends is promising. I love knowing as little as possible about most films I desire to see, which probably sounds insane. I just want to find out by myself.

It may be raining, but I'm not in the least unhappy. I'm looking forward to spending the evening cooking a fancy dinner, curling into the sofa while sipping tea. Autumn isn't that bad after all.

If you've been trying to reach this site, the reason to why it's been down is simple. The company that hosts my registered domain-names and direct the DNS-names, [joker.com](joker.com), has been [under a DOS-attack](https://joker.com/index.joker?mode=news&id=109):

> Joker.com currently experiences massive distributed denial of service attacks against nameservers. This affects DNS resolution of Joker.com itself, and also domains which make use of Joker.com nameservers.

This means [I'm not the only one affected](http://www.theinternetpatrol.com/massive-joker-dns-dos-takes-out-portion-of-internet), but hopefully, the disturbances are over.

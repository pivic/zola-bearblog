On [this page](http://rainbow.arch.scriptmania.com/rainbow_tv_episode.html), you can watch a blip from an episode of "Rainbow", a British children's series that was broadcast during the 70's and 80's. Check out the incredible innuendi, it's extreme! Writing scripts for kids' TV-shows must be extremely boring...but not this time. \[courtesy of **_\*K\* and Andreas Flodin_**\]

Today I visited my family, as my grandmother, on my mom's side, turned 92 years old. [Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-07-28-famlee) are some nice pictures. My sister's little kids are so cute!

After the family meet, I went to Vinterviken to meet with Frederic, Fredrik and Tessan, Olof and Milka. We listened a bit to [Jens Lekman](http://jenslekman.tk), who in my opinion shrunk even lower, as I don't like his lyrics or his music, even though he's a fair recording artist (as compared with his poor live-manship).

I (and Fredrik) took some pictures which are displayed [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-07-28-v).

As our combined fridge/freezer is breaking down (for instance, it currently, at maximum capacity, goes to +10 degrees Celsius, which is pathetic for a fridge) Mikaela ordered a new one which will arrive somewhere around 15-18 today. It's displayed [here](http://www.elektro-helios.se/node20.asp?intProductID=209&intCategoryID=23).

A couple of days ago, we bought a new bread-bin. [Here's a video](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-26-bread-bin.mov) displaying ALL it's marvellous capacities!

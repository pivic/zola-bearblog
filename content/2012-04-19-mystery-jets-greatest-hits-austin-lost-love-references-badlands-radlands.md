_Shalalalalalaa_

This song is [Mystery Jets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Jets)' collating-references moment.

As they've moved far from the boyishness of "_You Can't Fool Me Dennis_" - their first UK-charting single released in 2005 - the entire new album, "**Radlands**", is filled with references to cultural and geographic items.

Just start with the album cover:

Yes, that's the shape of Texas, USA. Those are cowboy boots. The title "**Radlands**" is both a pun on and designed in the same style as the title for Terrence Malick's film "[Badlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands_(film))" ((Despite the film taking place in South Dakota, Malick could have been born in Waco, Texas and has lived in Austin for a while.))

I'm a Texas/Austin-lover to my core.

Mystery Jets recorded the album in March-May of 2011 in a country house by the Colorado river in the Westlake area in Austin, Texas. The house was named Radlands. [They went all in](http://mysteryjets.com/radlands/1737/frat-chat) on the stereotypical Texan myth, and seem to have been enveloped by [the truth](http://mysteryjets.com/radlands/1740/y-all).

Frontman Blaine says:

> All we brought on the plane were the guitars on our backs, so we ended up borrowing all this amazing valve gear from an old guy called Jack who ran a little studio up in the hills ““ which is why the songs sound the way they do. In the daytime we wrote lyrics on the porch and in the evenings a family of deer would gather in the backyard to hear us play.

When I was last in Austin, deer would assemble to watch me be drunk. Almost happened. Nearly. Almost.

The track "_Greatest Hits_" off the new album is the apex of referencing, quite similar to [the lyrics](http://www.lyricsmania.com/plus_ones_lyrics_okkervil_river.html) off Okkervil River's "_[Plus Ones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaXvayF2vog)_", and about as cute. OR is an Austin band, too. Let me plant those conspiracy theory seeds, please.

In the song, a couple breaks up and the becoming solos sift through and divide up their mutual record collection. For geeks like myself, it's almost a game to think of which albums, artists and people they mean in the lyrics.

Is "_Village Green_" the same album as The Kinks' "_[Village Green Preservation Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_Green_Preservation_Society)_" or do I remember the title all wrong? Oh! "_[The Boy With The Arab Strap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_with_the_Arab_Strap)_", ha. I then agree with the notion that [The Fall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_%28band%29)'s "_This Nation's Saving Grace_" can probably only be listened to when pissed, but what's the hate behind [Mark E. Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_E._Smith) a line later about? And comparing Paul McCartney's "Band On The Run" project with his first album...[yeah](http://mysteryjets.com/radlands/1756/did-you-know).

It's really trivial, of course.

"_These were our greatest hits, shalalalala_"

[The NME](http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=1&title=mystery_jets_radlands_first_listen_1&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1) says:

> And back to more familiar jets territory we go, rather resembling “˜Young Love'. A relationship's final embers smoulder as the record collection is divided. The girl is allowed to keep “˜The Lexicon Of Love' by ABC, and “˜It's A Shame About Ray' by The Lemonheads, “˜No Need To Argue' by The Cranberries and “˜The Boy With The Arab Strap' by Belle And Sebastian. He wants to keep “˜Remain In Light' by Talking Heads, “˜Country Life' by Roxy Music, “˜The Aeroplane Over The Sea' by Neutral Milk Hotel and “˜The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society'. Fair choices. Really. For all that, it's a jolly thing riddled with "sha la las" and at least the suggestion that this relationship might survive through the power of song. Aaw.

The production and guitars are so crisp. The deadpan lead vocal wins. The thumping bass and the near-Creedence sound is so strummy. The chorus gets on your brain.

Welcome back, Mystery Jets. I've missed your comeback a lot.

"**Radlands**" is out on Rough Trade on April 30th.

As per usual, the below song will be gone in a week's time. Buy the album.

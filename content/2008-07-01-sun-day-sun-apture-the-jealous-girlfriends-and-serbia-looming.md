Whoa! After the rain from yesterday magically subsided, Stockholm's turning into a wonderful little place to be. Here's a film from Mariatorget, the place I [filmed yesterday](http://alpha.bambuser.com/channel/pivic/video/29630) during the apocalyptic rain.

I've just found [Apture](http://apture.com), a great way to add contextual pop-ups to my blog; their creating a WordPress plugin is brilliant. It's available for free to anybody, and a product video tour is available [here](http://www.apture.com/tour/4/). TechCrunch has covered it [here](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/30/apture-gives-contextual-popups-a-good-name). The product - so far, having used it for 24 hours - works magnificently and adds a lot more value than [Snap Shots](http://www.snap.com/snapshots.php), which I used before and is currently powering WordPress.com. You'll see a lot of examples of using Apture in [my latest Muxtape post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1501).

[Here](http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/510253/90219401/npr_90219401.mp3)'s a live show by The Jealous Girlfriends; they're a Brooklyn-based quartet making rock with interesting strokes. Good melodies crossed with arty rock. Or you can stream the track here:

I'm very much looking forward to going to Serbia. Yep, I'm going with X as my summer vacation breaks out in a week - I can't believe it's happening, to tell the truth. The Swedish weather has always been fairly unpredictable circa . I haven't been there since 1989, which feels freaky; what's _not_ happened to that country since then? It used to be part of Yugoslavia, got torn up and apart by civil war, invasions, had UN restrictions lavished upon its citizens, got bombed to shreds, Milosevic was overturned and killed, the country turned into Serbia and Montenegro, and then just Serbia. Part of me's excited to see what's going on, part of me is embarrassed because I somehow think I should know more about my heritage than I do. I'm hereby deciding to don't give a fuck about that as there's no rational reason for me to care; I mean, are my Serbian relatives supposed to know Swedish and all about the goings-on within these borders? Hell to the no. I'll get out of trouble by saying the words I know. Chleb, kluc and kurac.

Oh, now grey clouds are gathering above. I'm going home soon. I've nearly had enough of installing, troubleshooting, correcting stuff, documenting and visiting places.

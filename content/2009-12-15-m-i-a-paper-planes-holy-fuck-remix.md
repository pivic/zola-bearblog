**Bonus video** (in no way related to the track): I was in Liljeholmen this fine evening, surrounded by snow while watching a lake with ducks in it, nearly getting hit by a bicyclist. I wouldn't dare bicycle in this weather, snow tires or not, and I'm very happy about sitting at home right now, just typing away instead.

**Retraction of the day**:

> The Official Morrissey Webstore wishes to apologize to Morrissey store mailing list members who may have seen the mass e-mail advertisement that was sent out after Thanksgiving which mentioned eating turkey. Morrissey is a strict vegetarian and abhors the killing of defenseless animals for food. This ad was not endorsed in any way by Morrissey.

I'm quite sure somebody's having his skull...you know.

**N900 geekery and materialism in the extreme**:

Today I got word that Tre were to release the Nokia N900 for pre-bookings. Wee! So I waited. Nothing at midnight. Little wonder. In the morning: nothing. A little later I twittered Tre, who said I could call customer service to book my N900. YES! I did, spoke with somebody who told me I had a copy secured. I extended my phone subscription for 24 months following this.

At lunch-time I got a bad feeling. I called Tre's customer service who confirmed what my gut told me: no phone was booked and no subscription had been extended. Holy damn. I asked for somebody's boss. They said they'd bell me within 48 hours.

Three minutes later Tre tweeted something about there being no need to book a N900 since they'd receive "big volumes" of the phone come the third week of January; it'll be a perfect b-day present for me.

I called their customer service again, booked the phone and extended my subscription; I then tweeted Tre who couldn't help me - naturally - but called customer service to double-check, and they confirmed that my phone will be delivered in the third week of January. Wee!

I've not blogged in...forever.

It feels as though I'm reading other blogs - not that I'm doing a great job at that - rather than working on my own. What can I possibly tell you?

I'm well. I'm quite rested. Work is harrowing right now, as I'm working hard at relieving myself from work; it's now less than two months until I quit working at my current job and start work at the new place, something that I'm infinitely looking forward to!

My parents, my sister and her entire family came by to celebrate my birthday (thank you) last weekend, which was really nice.

Don't trust the pic. Blixa loves Magnus, my sister's boyfriend. And she loves X, most of all. She crawls, snuggles and contorts her way to get to X. And she lies in bed between us, being a little Heart and a Crux at the same time. I love X. And I love our little one.

And I miss Lotta. It's been a month since she passed away and I'm sad about that. Our little big kitty. And maybe one day, Blixa might get a friend. A little kitty friend. Some day it'll be likely to happen.

Soulwax's "_[A Ballad To Forget](http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/album/Any+Minute+Now/1124333)_" rings out and makes me think of Money Mark's voice and of how underrated they are. Sure, they make you dance but they'll make you cry as well.

And I'm happy. I'm happy when I'm home. When I'm in X's arms and she in mine, when I solve a professional puzzle, when I cradle what's rich to me; when I escape that which is materialistically available at a near distance, whether it is on the Internet or my new mobile phone, I just feel like the words I need are the words of X. Of my friends. Of what brings me joy, of catching a glimpse of a snowflake from the sky. Touching verbal smiles and warnings from roof-tiles that grind and threaten to come loose to crush what's beneath us, to open up the ground.

It's as though I'm close to something good, even though I cannot verbalise what it is. And I'm really happy with that. And actually, with discovering "[30 Rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30%20Rock)" and looking forward to meeting [The Pirate Cats](http://piratkatter.com) tonight.

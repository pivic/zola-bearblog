My favourite place to drink espresso, is Pappa Ray Ray. They've just had a new neon sign installed, as seen [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-02-08-pappa1.jpg) and [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-02-08-pappa2.jpg).

Also, they're planning to open their downstairs cellar room for clubbing. That's right, an all-night place opening near my work-place? Could be good, so we'll just see how that develops.

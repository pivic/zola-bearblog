The telephone system we use at work allows the person who is called to see the name of the caller, if she/he is calling from within the company. I called a company person had asked to have an application upgraded.

**He**: Hello? **I**: Hello! My name is Niklas Pivic, and I am calling you regarding our scheduled appointment for me to upgrade your application. **He**: Oh, oh, now I see! I'd forgotten all about that. I just glanced at the display... _Niklas Pivic_. Well, I can't remember asking some pizza maker to call me.

How. About. Them. Apples.

**I**: Well, you still haven't, but maybe there's more to this than just your memory. **He**: Well, hee, yes, maybe.

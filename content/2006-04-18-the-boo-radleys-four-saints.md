[![The Boos](http://www.booradleys.co.uk/wallpaper/boo_wallpaper_06.jpg)](http://www.booradleys.co.uk/wallpaper/boo_wallpaper_06.jpg)Even though [The Boo Radleys](http://www.booradleys.co.uk) aren't all that well known outside the confines of their super-hit "[Wake Up Boo!](http://www.booradleys.co.uk/lyrics.php?id=138)", they've got a lot more coming, and one day, one day, will be respected as a band whose only real contenders were (and are) [Super Furry Animals](http://superfurry.com).

This track is an experimental bit that shows the mastermind of [Martin Carr](http://www.bravecaptain.co.uk), chief orchestrator and song-writer of the band, but where the other band-members have chipped in notably. It shows the breadth of the band, so dig in, and get their double-disc anthology, "[Find The Way Out](http://www.booradleys.co.uk/boo_radleys_anthology.php)".

Mind that this download is available for one week only, and don't forget to check out [the lyrics and notes for the track](http://www.booradleys.co.uk/lyrics.php?id=46), that is "Four Saints". Enjoy!

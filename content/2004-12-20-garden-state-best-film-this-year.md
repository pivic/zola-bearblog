I hope you gnarly kids have seen "[Garden State](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766)", which, to me, was the surprise of the year. #162 on the IMDb "best films ever"-list, you say? To fuggduh with those numbers. I mean, as long as [LOTR](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260) and [The Incredibles](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705) are within those realms, that list is worth nothing.

So back to the celebration. Well, the film is starred by Zach Braff, a person most known for starring in "Scrubs" a TV comedy series mostly played in a hospital. I've seen an episode and a half, and I loathe it. I couldn't care less for a series that in the least reminds me of "Ally McBeal", which makes me cascade-vomit. It's true. I do not write that for effect.

So he stars in it. And he's written _and_ directed it. My point is that this film should be bad, but it's not. It's probably - you've guessed it - the best film this year. And why do I today write as if I'm an American TV-show-presenter? I'm extremely high-strung. I drank many-a-cup of tea yesterday, woke up five times during the night, had great troubles sleeping, finally when I woke up, I jumped up out of bed, showered, got dressed and managed to fit in a few things before heading off to work, where I've spent five minutes writing this. I'm fast right now. Too fast. Back to the film review.

I did not expect much from it. So imagine my sudden sense of relief when the dialogue proved...human, the music was great and the story-line moved along quite unexpected turns, even though they were conventional at times, that's not a bad thing at all, in this case. I won't write anything about the film itself, but it's extremely good. See it, for what it's worth. I spoke a bit with J-O, a guy who owns [Swedisc](http://www.swedisc.com), the place from where I order almost all of my DVD's, and he hated it, warned me of it. But then again, he seems to be a kind of Joel Shumacher guy. If he reads this I'm sure to have my membership deleted even if it's true. ;)

So go see the film (or [order it from Swedisc](http://www.swedisc.com/film/moreinfo.php?ID=PP18757&LastStop=/main.php))!

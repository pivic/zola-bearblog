Joaquin Phoenix does not sound like Johnny Cash, when he's singing his songs. It's not that I know he's singing and Cash isn't, but Phoenix just doesn't sound like Cash, no matter what [Fader Magazine](http://www.thefader.com/blog/articles/2005/11/15/we-walk-the-line) or anybody else is saying. It sounds as if he's got something stuck at the back of his throat, and is reaching for it using his larynx. At times I'm afraid he'll start suffocating, and we don't want to lose another acting Phoenix brother, do we?

Noel Gallagher, the Oasis-brother who's still responsible for writing most of their songs, has struck out on hip-hop. Read the original story [here](http://www.gigwise.com/news.asp?contentid=10487). If the quote from timeoff.com is correct, and I'm quoting him, he's saying all hip-hop-artists are crack-heads and idiots. Interesting. By the way, he's also saying sexism by a rock band, in the 70's or 80's, would provoke "shock, horror and outrage". As proof that he's a dribbling idiot fuckhead, [here's a cover by The Scorpions](http://www.zonicweb.net/badalbmcvrs/badalbumcoverstopten/toptenbadalbumcovers1.htm), for an album called "Virgin Killer". That's nice. There are, of course, worse examples. And the way Gallagher says all hip-hop-artists are idiots. Come again? Even if you compare [Chamillionaire's latest album](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:51sqoaraeijm) with Oasis' latest one, you couldn't say hip-hop is wrong (even though I strongly dislike said album by Chamillionaire). I still like Oasis' first album a lot, but there's just no way in hell that they'll ever come back.

By no way, isn't it weird what tabs in Firefox can do to you? When I had too many tabs open simultaneously, [this](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-11-14-google1.gif) is what I saw. Having closed a few, I saw [this](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-11-14-google2.gif) instead.

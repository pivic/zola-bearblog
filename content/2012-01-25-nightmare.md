A while back, X and I saw "[_The Time Traveler's Wife_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452694)", which was a big mistake. The past night, my subconscious apparently tried to get back at me for that.

My nightware probably seems "get over it!" to you, but felt horrible. In it, X and I knew I was going to die at a specific date. We lived life until that date, until which the nightmare played like a film - a few scenes from some years, a birthday celebrated here, a trip abroad there, chatting together over coffee, meeting friends and family - all flitted through until the day I was to die.

We were sitting on our bed at home, looking through souvenirs we'd picked up together, reading letters written to each other over the years. The bedroom was all white, even stuff that's not white in real life. X looked into my eyes and kissed me. Tears flowed and we both knew it was only a matter of minutes until I'd die. I remember thinking the worst thing isn't dying, it's that I'd be without X.

If there's a higher power, I wish that I'll never experience that dream again!

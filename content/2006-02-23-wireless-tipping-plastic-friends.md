I just ordered this [wireless Linksys router](http://tinyurl.com/hy9bq). At first I was thinking of a Netgear-router, but I felt I really needed the most insane-looking router known to man. Just look at that thing! Did [Louis Wain](http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/nbb421/student2003/epl8) design it? Anyway, going wireless is so great. The next project will be liberating a computer, placing it in a wardrobe (or somewhere else where it cannot do mischief), install Hula and then have my own e-mail/calendar/address book-server.

I'm interested in [this post](http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13) on automatically adding service-charges at Aquavit, a restaurant in New York. That's already installed in Per Se, another high-end restaurant in New York, and Thomas Keller, super-chef extraordinaire (just look at The French Laundry, and you'll know what I mean - if you happen to get hold of the episode of "A Cook's Tour", where Anthony Bourdain visits The French Laundry, you'll want to go there, _really much_) is into it as well. The Swedish owner of Aquavit speaks out in the post:

> Mr. Swahn, who is Swedish, noted that in Sweden automatic tips are routinely added. â€œService is not as good there as in New York City,'' he said, citing predetermined gratuities as a probable reason.

Or maybe, it's simply the only reason to why some service-people are still alive. In Sweden, I mean. [I've dissed most service in Stockholm before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=869), and I'm quite sure service in New York mostly is better than here. Anyway, interesting cultural differences in the service profession.

I'm sure it would all change if the service-people could get hold of some of [this super-repellent plastic](http://www2.technologyreview.com/BizTech-R&D/wtr_16415,295,p1.html); I love the real name: hydrophobic plastic. The plastic has a phobia against water. Ah, it's way past bed-time, and tomorrow I'm meeting up with Jesper to go out, which will be very nice. I haven't seen him in ages, the soon-to-be-father. To think my oldest friend will be a dad in a couple of weeks. Too bad [our favourite rapper](http://zakdaddys.blogspot.com) can't join us, but as he's busy blasting through Eastern Europe in search of Blighty, he's not available.

"_Once more into the breach, dear fellows_."

And finally, as I've [just written about Ian Brady](https://niklasblog.com/?p=886), now the man who hoaxed his way into British criminal history by pretending to be The Yorkshire Ripper, [has surfaced](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/4743358.stm). What a poor, deranged person, especially as he practically ground the entire investigation to a halt because of his Dubya-ish antic. Effing [Peter Sutcliffe](http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial3/yorkshire).

![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-01-11-knug.gif)Today, DN has [a big chronicle](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1042&a=364497&previousRenderType=6) \[in Swedish\] written by Henrik Brors, showing how The King of Sweden has spoken about the tsunami disaster in Asia.

Not quite attempting to veil his words in [a recent interview in DN](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=147&a=363787) \[in Swedish\], the King says the Swedish government didn't act quickly enough, to help the victims of this disaster. This provoked a reaction from the Swedish government, blaming our horrible Prime Minister of which DN has also published [an article](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1042&a=364043) \[in Swedish\].

Anyway, there are some problems afoot. According to Swedish law, the King is not allowed to criticise the government. He continually continues to do this, of course, as he's not very bright. He's made some classic errors through his time.

Henrik Brors among other things wrote about the "superiority of the democratic society" and later wrote about the King as a "leader-figure". How fucked is this equation?

I cannot see how monarchy and democracy can go together. The royal family receives millions of Swedish crowns every year - just for being born into a specific family. This is ludicrous, a sheer laugh in the face of democracy (which, for those among us who do not remember, is a state of affairs that means monarchy should not exist) and makes the royal family the biggest welfare recipient in Sweden, without having to do anything to earn their pay.

Most of the Swedes who like the royal family, seem to think they're "cute" or that they "make good PR for Sweden". I can confront these illusions quickly: they aren't and they don't, so shut up.

They don't make good PR as having a royal family in a democratic state makes us a laughing stock. "Good PR"? Oh really? I thought our tourist agencies took care of that. Please, give me a list of the tourists who make their way to Sweden because of the royal family, and I'll clap my hands.

Back to Henrik Brors. He thinks it's a good idea to let the King speak his mind. Oh great. First he makes a logic error, and now thinks breaking the law is a good idea. Anyway, what I'm really not for, is that our homeless, our immigrants who've become Swedish members of society, the mentally insane among our (and when I write "our" I mean the Swedish citizens) many other vunerable groups of society have to fight their way through bureaucracy, hell and many a burdens that the royal family have never, ever been exposed to, to get their money from the welfare office, and that's a gigantic difference. Instead, the royal family sits in their palace, lives off our money for literally nothing and go on vacations in other countries. I'm sick of them. I'm almost on the brink of asking for a Swedish Guy Fawkes of sorts, who could see to the Swedish Royal Palace.

A few days ago, Blixa turned on the radio while I was taking a shower. The news came on, reporting the tragic death of a child; said child had played at kindergarten while wearing a helmet that got stuck, whereupon the child died of suffocation. After that piece of news, including an interview with crying staff, the radio station briskly broadcast Pink's "_Get The Party Started_".

It reminds me of how [The Smiths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Smiths)' "_[Panic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic%20%28song%29)_" was written. From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_%28song%29):

> A story circulated as the basis for the song is that days before recording the song, Marr and Morrissey were listening to BBC Radio One when a news report announced the Chernobyl disaster. Straight after the report, disc jockey Steve Wright played the song "I'm Your Man" by pop duo Wham!. "I remember actually saying, 'What the fuck has this got to do with people's lives?'" Marr recalled. "We hear about Chernobyl, then, seconds later, we're expected to jump around to 'I'm Your Man'".

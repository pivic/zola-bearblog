Every year the [Darwin Awards](http://www.darwinawards.com) are held. These awards are given to people who have gotten killed by doing something extremely stupid (or, as the people who host the Darwin Awards page say: "The Darwin Awards honor those who improve our gene pool... by removing themselves from it"). Examples:

\* An insurance defrauder amputates his leg with a chainsaw \* A farmer avoids bee stings by sealing his head in a plastic bag \* A man saws through a branch directly overhead

You get the picture. [Here is a list](http://www.kontraband.com/wordsview.asp?ID=154) of the winners this year. My favourites are number 6 and number 1.

I've discovered a new TV series called "[Bored To Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bored%20to%20Death)" from HBO. It's written by [Jonathan Ames](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ames), and is centered around a writer named Jonathan Ames (!) who is a quite pathetic character played by Jason Zimmerman who - during the first minute of the series - gets dumped by his girlfriend because he drinks too much and smokes too much weed.

Sounds like a winner, right?

Ames (the character) is left desolate, except for his companion, a bearded, weird friend. His apartment is pretty empty, with stuff in boxes. So he's left gazing at a [Raymond Chandler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond%20Chandler) detective novel and comes up with a new persona: he writes an ad on Craigslist saying he's an _unlicensed_ private detective and would like to take on cases. Low rates.

So, people call him and he takes on cases while working for his eccentric boss, played by [Ted Danson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted%20Danson), trying to write a second novel and stay away from too much white wine and pot.

Easy music, noir-otic ((Their word, not mine!)) personalities, Ted Danson's character's suave persona, the different cases and the often-slow pace is enough for me. There's no other series like this out there, and I even like the celeb cameos. A commendable pastime this is, and as every episode is about 25 minutes long, it's perfect for subway rides.

By the way, I like [the title sequence](http://www.artofthetitle.com/2009/10/05/bored-to-death):

> ROCKY (Martin Kellerman). Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. Translating 35,000 words of very funny Swedish dialogue into hopefully very funny American dialogue is taking --who knew?-- longer than the couple of months I set aside for it. Looking to premiere it in November...

So, "[Rocky](http://www.rocky-digital.com)" is a comic that used to run in [Metro](http://www.metro.se), a free Swedish morning paper, and has since turned into a stage play and a comic magazine of its own. The writer and inker, Martin Kellerman, lives in the south side of Stockholm city, and has turned Rocky into an entity quite on his own.

Rocky's an ordinary 20-something-turning-30, who's basically living a slacker life, complaining that Slick Rick and EPMD never turn up in Stockholm, and parties at the same hang-outs when he's not crouching over his PS2. So what gives? The humor, folks. There's a lot of humor and love behind Kellerman's spelling errors and wiggerisms. This comic actually attracts both sexes, believe it or not. Let's see how the English translation turns out; I think a lot of material might be too Swedish for the rest of the world, but we'll see! I'm excited.

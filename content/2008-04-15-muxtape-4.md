Here's the fourth installment of my muxtape, and you'll play it [here](http://pivic.muxtape.com).

1\. **Fumio Hayasaka** - "Titles"

Hayasaka made a lot of cinematic music for Akira Kurosawa, one of the masters of cinema. This is just one example of his expertise in using crescendo.

2\. **Jean-Michel Jarre** - "The Overture"

While Jarre has more or less turned away from his more avant-garde self in the late 70's, this track - off his great live-album "_The Concerts in China_" - shows how his sense of arrangement and lush analogue synthesizers rocked. Slow and massive, this is how he kicked off the very first concerts by a westerner in China for many a year.

3\. **Clint Mansell** - "Summer Overture"

Taken from the soundtrack to "_[Requiem For A Dream](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093)_", Mansell churns out a harsh theme by violin.

4\. **Aretha Franklin** - "Niki Hoeky"

The voice! Next to Dusty Springfield, few soul-singers have turned my world upside-down like Aretha.

5\. **Dexys Midnight Runners** - "Thankfully Not Living In Yorkshire It Doesn't Apply"

Speaking of soul, here's a white bunch led by [Kevin Rowland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rowland) who really managed to show the world what northern soul can be about - brazen, political, carrying its own system of laws and - very importantly - you _have_ to dance to it.

6\. **Dan the Automator/DJ Shadow/Nana Simopoulos** - "Ganges A Go-Go"

This is a mighty ensemble of DJ's and producers, who've taken on Bollywood jingles and made them into Indian-ish hip-hop; this is taken from the album "_[Bombay The Hard Way: Guns, Cars And Sitars](http://www.amazon.com/Bombay-Hard-Way-Guns-Sitars/dp/B00000HYAK)_".

7\. **Blondie** - "Maria"

What to say? It's a strong pop track.

8\. **Primal Scream** - "Stone My Soul"

This is taken off "_Dixie Narco_", a very early, wonderful EP by the band, just as they were stepping off the trippy dub masterpiece that is "_Screamadelica_", into the world of cocaine and a lot of time before their descent into the paranoid, schizophrenic, political world of "_Vanishing Point_". Don't miss this track. It's a quite treble'd slide-guitar blues-trick, and I love it.

9\. **Public Image, Ltd.** - "Public Image"

To everyone who's ever thought John Lydon was washed-up after Sex Pistols: fuck you. PIL's albums are golden and this is a perfect example of this. Nobody laughs like Lydon.

10\. **Clint Mansell** - "Pi r^2"

Yes, a second track by Mansell, also for a film by Aronofsky, this time for the beautiful "_[Pi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138704)_". Breakbeats are nice.

11\. **Jeffrey Lewis** - "The Last Time I Did Acid I Went Insane"

A modern folk classic, and don't forget to check out [the lyrics](http://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/jeffrey_lewis/the_last_time_i_did_acid_i_went_insane-lyrics-1268334.html). Brilliant.

12\. **Jimi Hendrix** - "Voodoo Child"

The God of Guitar. This song evokes two memories in me: first, when I was a young lad who had just started playing guitar, I watched Hendrix's performance from Woodstock, and basically wanted to smash my guitar into the ground. I remember thinking _Oh, this is as good as it gets, so fuck it. I might as well find another instrument to play._ Then, as I was gaining confidence, I heard Johnny Marr play "The Queen Is Dead" and was about to give up the second time around. I'm glad I didn't - even though my friends may well be of another opinion.

The second memory that rushes through me is of Withnail ((One of the lead characters in the epic film "[Withnail & I](http://www.criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=119)".)) being drunk out of his mind, driving down an English motorway with "I" waking up beside him, dizzily finding out just where he is as the song really kicks off post-intro. Unforgettable.

Incredible. Yesterday I received an e-mail from Lena, the person responsible for rearing X's and my lovely cat, [Blixa](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3459647663). She's been a more than laudable breeder and is a very nice human being - that I think are two qualities that go hand in hand as far as raising animals is concerned - and as such, we've updated her on Blixa's growing-up from time to time, even though we've only had her in our realm for five weeks.

Before we got Blixa, Lena let us borrow [Lotta](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/2944282695) for a while, to see whether my allergy for all things furry would kill me or not. I don't think it did, and hence we bought Blixa.

Back to the e-mail. Without getting too personal, I can say that Lena heart-wrenchingly wrote that her family's priorities had changed and that they wondered whether X and I would consider letting Lotta into our lives, for good.

I don't know when Lotta is coming into our lives, but whenever that is, our arms are open for her. Here's a video of the little piece of thing, from before she went home to Lena.

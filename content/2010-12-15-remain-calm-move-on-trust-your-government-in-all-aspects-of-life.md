> Success is the important thing. Propaganda is not a matter for average minds, but rather a matter for practitioners. It is not supposed to be lovely or theoretically correct. I do not care if I give wonderful, aesthetically elegant speeches, or speak so that women cry. The point of a political speech is to persuade people of what we think right. I speak differently in the provinces than I do in Berlin, and when I speak in Bayreuth, I say different things than I say in the Pharus Hall. That is a matter of practice, not of theory. We do not want to be a movement of a few straw brains, but rather a movement that can conquer the broad masses. Propaganda should be popular, not intellectually pleasing. It is not the task of propaganda to discover intellectual truths. ((Speech by Joseph Goebbels on 9 January 1928 to an audience of party members at the so-called "Hochschule f√ºr Politik", a series of training talks for Nazi party members in Berlin; source: [Wikiquote](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels).))

You can now read scanned bits (or sometimes entire books) online, due to a new service from Google. Check the FAQ and details out [here](http://print.google.com), also [here, an interesting excerpt](http://print.google.com/googleprint/excerpt_lg.gif) of what things can look like when searching for specific words and entering Google Print and click [here](http://print.google.com/print?id=lg5mtIGyKGQC&prev=http://print.google.com/print%3Fq%3Dromeo%2Band%2Bjuliet&pg=67&sig=kbG6LQEGa_syoQY2n7LjU2N0K1A) to see what clicking on "Romeo & Juliet" from Google Print brings you - the ability to read the thing online.

Very nice. I just hope this brings the most interesting results; i.e. not the most commercial ones, constantly linking to Amazon.com or sites like that.

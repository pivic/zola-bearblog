Recently at a charity dinner for [Kerry](http://www.johnkerry.com), [Whoopi Goldberg](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000155) joked about Dubya and has hence lost her contract with [Slim-Fast](http://www.slim-fast.com), some worthless company.

Goldberg says that she has been joking about presidents for the past 20 years, and adds that she hopes the republican re-election committee is using as much time to better the economy of the USA, as they're spending trying to damage her personal one.

This makes me think of what happens almost every time an American celebrity speaks out against the atrocities performed by the US government. I'm thinking about Marlon Brando, Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins.

A dear friend who got big with his band during the start of the 90's went on tour, as bands that get big do. On said tour the band he played in - and still plays in - received a lot of demos by members of the audience, who also wanted to get big.

These songs were played on their tour-bus and constantly discussed. My friend was nice enough to compile the very worst of these songs as a CD, so without further ado, download it [here](http://drop.io/theworstsongs) and get ready to endure 1 hour and 7 minutes of the worst pap you're likely to hear for a long time (until you turn on your radio).

For a mere sample of what's available on this album, click [here](http://drop.io/theworstsongs) and listen to or download one single track. Mind you, the tracks on this album are of different genres, not only tacky metal ((Even though that genre is the most laughable one, considering the clothes those guys often wear.)) like in the sample. But, that horrid singing...it makes me cringe and wince at the same time, the drums are almost as un-synched as the police-investigation of the [Zodiac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_killer) and when paired with the distortion that's thrown in I nearly sucker-punch myself for playing this. And it's a LONG track! Ackp!

Play until madness ensues and blame me for your mental ills. Go ahead! Don't let the fact that some of these songs are in Swedish deter you from listening to them; if you don't know Swedish, you're better off.

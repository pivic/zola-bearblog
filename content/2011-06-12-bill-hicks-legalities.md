The below is verbatim from the book "_[Love All The People: Lyrics, Letters, Routines](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248090.Love_All_the_People)_", which I highly recommend; this is originally from one of his performances at the Vic Theatre, Chicago, USA, in November 1990, which was later released as an HBO video special in 1991, titelled "_[One Night Stand](http://www.documentarywire.com/bill-hicks-legendary-one-night-stand)_".

Thank God they're taxing alcohol, man. It means we've got those good roads we can get fucked up and drive on. 'Thank God they're taxing this shit, man...we'd be doing doughnuts in a wheat field right now. Thank God we're on a highway. Whoooo, this is a _good_ drug.' Cos I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, man. If I were going to legalize a drug, it sure wouldn't have been alcohol. Sorry, there's better drugs, and better drugs for you. That's a fact. You may stop your internal dialogue. 'Hmm, but Bill, alcohol's an acceptable part of ...' Shut the fuck up. You're wrong. K? K. Shit man, not only do I think marijuana should be _legalized_...I think it should be mandatory. I'm a hardliner. Think about it, man. You get in traffic behind somebody like: huuuh, huuuh. (_making car horn noises_)

'Shut up and smoke that: it's the law.' 'Oh sorry, I was taking life seriously. Oh, man! Who's hungry?'

That would be a nice world, wouldn't it? Quiet, mellow, hungry, high people everywhere. Just Dominos' pizza trucks passing each other. Every single highway, parades of Dominos'. (_car horn_) Let them get stuck in traffic: _all_ our pizzas will be free. I'm a fucking dreamer, man! But I'm not the only one. (_audience cheers_) Dreamers, man. Pot is a better drug than alcohol - fact! Fact. Stop your internal dialogue. 'But Bill, alcohol's a blah blah blah“”' Shut up! You're wrong, get over it. K? K. I'll prove it to you, man. You're at a ball game, or a concert and someone's really violent and aggressive and obnoxious. Are they _drunk_? Or are they smoking pot? Which is it?

_Audience_: Drunk!

_Bill_: They're drunk. I have never seen people on pot get in a fight because it is _fucking_ impossible.

'Hey buddy!' 'Hey what?' 'Hey.' 'Hey'

End of argument. Say you get in a car accident, and you've been smoking pot...you're only going four fucking miles an hour. (_makes skidding, then crashing noise_)

'Shit, we hit something.' 'Oh, uh-uh, uh-uh. We got rear-ended by a Dominos' truck, man.'

Just a better world. I'm _not_ promoting the use of drugs. I'm just telling ya, I've had good times on 'em. That's the truth. I've also had bad times on 'em too, OK?

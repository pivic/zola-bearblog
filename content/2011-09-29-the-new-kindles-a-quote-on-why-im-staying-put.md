So, Amazon has released new versions of the Kindle, their e-book; notably [Kindle Fire](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B0051VVOB2), their Android-driven colour reader/game-station/video-player.

I actually own one since almost a year back and I definitely don't regret it. Here are words [from Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/2011/09/amazons_new_kindles) that I share completely on why owning one - and in the process explains why I won't pick up a new Kindle anytime soon.

> I got a Kindle about a year ago, and I use it much more than I expected to. I like reading on e-ink. I look at glowing backlit displays all day, every day. I've been obsessed with computers my whole life. I love glowing screens. When I'm away from my computer for days, I'm happy when I sit down in front of it. There's a certain feeling I get when I use any computer “” a Mac, an iPhone, an iPad, my TiVo, even an ATM or the credit card slider at the supermarket. Cool, a computer.
> 
> I read books on my iPad, too, but reading on the iPad doesn't have the same mental-mode-switching effect. When I read with the iPad I feel like I'm doing the same basic thing I do as I read on my Mac all day long “” just with a different device. It's more pleasant, in many ways, and definitely more personal. But I'm still in the same mental mode “” fully aware that anything and everything is just a few taps and few seconds away.
> 
> E-ink feels peaceful to me. The Kindle doesn't feel like a computer. It feels “” not to the touch but to the eyes and mind “” like a crudely-typeset and slightly smudgily-printed paper book. That's a good thing. Battery life is un-computer-like as well: Amazon measures e-ink Kindle battery life in months, and they're not joking. It's a surprise when the Kindle actually needs a charge. I was a doubter until I owned one, but now I'm convinced that e-ink readers have tremendous value even in the post-iPad world.

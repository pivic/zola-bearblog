[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-05-25-kitty.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-05-25)Yesterday \[avatar:/bilder/avatars/fdp.gif\]Frederic\[/avatar\] met \[avatar:/bilder/avatars/mikaela.jpg\]Mikaela\[/avatar\] and me at our place, where Mikaela (with a little help from me, actually) made a very nice and fresh tuna salad. After that, we left to see Eva-Marie, one of Mikaela's work-mates, who breeds cats.

She breeds [British Shorthair cats](http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/british.html), to be exact, and [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-05-25)'s a gallery containing a lot of them. I miss my Cornish Rex kitties I used to have around.

One of Frederic's kitties died a few days back, so he's decided to get hold of a new one.

Frederic picked the kitty that was left out of this litter, a light-grey kitty, with a spot behind its neck. These kittens (as opposed to Frederic's) are socially adept, and not semi-crazed ones. Frederic's "old cats" were quite scared whenever anything happened, e.g. Frederic walking into a room. When an animal responds to a person, whom the animal has known for years, by leaping bounds to avoid him/her, it's either a sure sign the animal has been subject to abuse (by that person) or that's it's socially maladjusted. The breeder who Frederic bought his cats from apparently lived with loads of animals, including a huge dog, in a very small apartment, and the animals rarely, if ever, saw any other human beings than their captor.

[Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-05-25/2005-05-25-kitties.mp4)'s a film \[MP4, 1,2MB\] of the kitties we visited yesterday. Note mother kitty popping up at the end. They're huge, the British Shorthairs!

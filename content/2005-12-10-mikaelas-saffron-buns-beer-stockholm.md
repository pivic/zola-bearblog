Mikaela's made "saffranslängder", which is a Swedish word for which there isn't - to my knowledge - any English ready-made translation available. I took a few pictures of them, [during their shaping](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/72097278) and afterwards, from [the finished products](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/72096067) to [a detail](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/72095459) (that I'm very pleased with). So go git.

DN has posted [this article](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=625&a=499822&previousRenderType=6) on the best places in Stockholm city, to go and have a beer in. There's a two-page PDF file of the review available [here](http://www.dn.se/content/1/c6/50/02/84/pastanol.pdf). Very inspiring, and I love the fact that DN have written about the service-level, apart from the expected details. Very good, very welcome guide to the beers of the world - and, indeed, of Sweden.

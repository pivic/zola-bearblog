Post-its, sticky notes, paper scraps with a tad of adhesive stuck to one side - no matter what you call them, people have been using these to jot on since 1979. Not much has happened since then with this. Should it? I think you should really see this video, which (in an easy-to-understand, not-too-technical way) shows what the future of sticky notes might look like.

I mean, using this technology you can scrawl "Dan's book on flickr, return next friday" on a sticky, place it in the book you just borrowed, hide the book among your countless, million of other books on flickr, then having the RFID-chip that's implanted in the note communicate with your computer to let your seemingly unintelligible handwriting transform into computer readable text which is then indexed; thus you can now search your computer to find said book, or see the list of all the books tagged "flickr". Plus the next Friday your calendar software reminds you to return the book. It's all sick in a big brother sense of the word, yet strangely cool.

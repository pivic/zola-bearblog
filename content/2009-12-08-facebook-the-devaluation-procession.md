Log in, deactivate, log out.

My beloved X recently did this. She [deactivated her Facebook account](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2009/12/07/my-pain-is-more-abstract-than-yours), and to me that's a stroke of good.

I've been thinking about this ever since most of my friends signed up for Facebook accounts. When somebody signs up, she/he tries to get the hang of it. Then, the flurry of status updates, applications, group invitations, blah, blah. Time passes. What changes? Most people comment on each-other's updates, click to Facebook-like something but...what does it amount to?

To me, it feels like Facebook-like'ing isn't at all the same as saying "I like this". To me, the gist of Facebook gestures doesn't whittle away with time as much as it actually devalues the gist.

I don't think feeling like this is brought on by some sort of net fatigue, as I feel intensely happier by receiving an e-mail from a friend than watching my Facebook live flow of updates, applications and friends rushing. Actually, those people I _truly_ connect with I mostly do outside of Facebook, thank Bog. At least, that's where the meaningful happens.

A lot of people talk a lot about how we shouldn't get wrapped up in one big web service, like Facebook or Google. But I say it's not the provider but the content that says it all, and currently I'm sick of Facebook.

**edit**: I've just deactivated my Facebook account. Adios!

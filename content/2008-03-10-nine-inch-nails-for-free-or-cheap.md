Even though I don't like [Nine Inch Nails](http://nin.com) as much as I used to, especially after the album "With Teeth", I still love Trent Reznor for his humanistic views. Even though I might very well be the last person on Earth to write about this, I love the fact that he's released "[Ghosts I-IV](http://ghosts.nin.com/main/home)", a double album, without any ads or any record label to help. He's offering "Ghosts I" free of charge by downloading a ZIP-file. You'll get the full album, a PDF-file containing the album art and a bunch of graphics to boot. There are other packages available "Ghosts I-IV" in a variety of file-formats, offering multi-track wave-files so that you can remix the tracks to BluRay-versions of the songs to...it's mind-boggling. I've gone for 10USD and I get a double-CD-album. ((Well, postage and packing included, it's actually 23USD, but what the hell, gotta support the arts, kiddo!)) _And_ I got to download the album in [FLAC](http://flac.sourceforge.net/faq.html#general__what_is) at 700KB/s, so I'm really happy now, being able to listen to it before I get it in the mail.

Here's the album art for your viewing pleasures. I wouldn't give more than I did for this album, but I love the fact that I could download and listen to a substantial portion of it before making my mind up. This is definitely the way to go, and I hand kudos to Trent Reznor for his widening the Radiohead business-model which I've written more about previously, right [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1351).

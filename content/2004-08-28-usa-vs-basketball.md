I think the whole thing stunk. Yesterday, [the USA played a very poor game of hoops and lost against Argentina](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics_2004/basketball/3606716.stm). It seems the Americans didn't have any three-point-shooters, and besides, their team wasn't very clear-cut, it even lacked of sympathy from viewers, and if I could, I'd have flown in [Rip Hamilton](http://www.nba.com/playerfile/richard_hamilton) to save the day. Maybe throw in [Kevin Garnett](http://www.nba.com/playerfile/kevin_garnett) as well. Oh yes, I would have turned the tableau. Bribes, anabolic steroids and threats abound. Maybe that would even have helped Serbia-Montenegro, who played _really_ poor?

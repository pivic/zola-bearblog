I'm back. Kind of. Even though I feel like I should write about how how easter's been with relatives, friends, love and all, I leave that for later. I'm stuffed with work. It's absolutely heinous, crashing down. I'm writing this from work, during one of my governmentally sponsored 5-minutes-every-hour breaks.

I've just discovered Muxtapes. What's that? You create an account, upload up to 12 tracks \[max 10MB a piece\] and then organise them. You can even tidy up the names. I keep my songs available [here](http://pivic.muxtape.com) and I plan to create a new muxtape every week as long as I live until I...compile my first [UTI](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1436).

Still, here's a description of the songs on this week's muxtape, which I plan on letting live for this week and the next before exchanging it for new stuff:

1\. **Simian Mobile Disco** - "Sleep Deprivation"

Quite a grower, this one. I've dreamt about DJ'ing it in a dark room, with only a little stobe to begin with, and then cascade as the track reaches its crescendo. Electronic, minimalistic growling at its very top.

2\. **Voxtrot** - "Every Day"

Love.

3\. **Amy Winehouse** - "Love Is A Losing Game \[Truth & Soul remix\]"

A brilliant remix of her track, lifting it far above the original. Her voice is truly bettered by this remix.

4\. **Tokyo Police Club** - "In A Cave"

The first released track off their new album, "[Elephant Shell](http://tokyopoliceclub.com/News/elephant-shell)". I think the voice is better than ever; crisp production skills!

5\. **Gene** - "You'll Never Walk Again"

Love. Again.

6\. **The Tough Alliance** - "Koka-Kola Veins"

The drunkest band in the world! Their studio work is often impeccable, though, as is the case here.

7\. **Dirty Pretty Things** - "[You Fucking Love It](http://www.stlyrics.com/songs/d/dirtyprettythings25788/youfuckingloveit1039799.html)"

This is the first song I heard by DPT. I listened to it so very, very scared that Mr. Bar√¢t would fuck things up after having split up The Libertines, but no. This band is one of the most frequently listened-to in my book.

8\. **Dusty Springfield** - "I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself"

Yes, The White Stripes covered it. Yes, the original unveils Dusty's angelic voice, floating above everything else.

9\. **Blur** - "Sing"

Ever since hearing this track in the film "_Trainspotting_", I've loved it. Droning masterpiece from the beginning of the band's career.

10\. **LCD Soundsystem** - "No Love Lost"

It's a Joy Division-cover, released only on vinyl, so get a load before it vanishes.

11\. **Young Leek** - "Jiggle It"

This is a mash-up courtesy of Hot Chip, where they've paired the rapper's stuff with New Order's "Bizarre Love Triangle".

12\. **Tom Waits** - "Way Down In The Hole"

A hommage of sorts to "_The Wire_", the best TV-series ever, that recently aired what seems very likely to be the very last episode of the series; every season of the series has had this song as the opening theme, covered by different artists. Waits made the original.

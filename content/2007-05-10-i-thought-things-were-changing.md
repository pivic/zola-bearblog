I'm not handling my situation well. Coping seems distant. I don't know what to do with my pain and sadness. I feel everything may be fleeting, except for my own emotions.

It's as if here and now is only passing and that everybody dear to me will some day leave for something better. I may be right. I don't know.

I'm panicking. Other times I'm calm. I don't know what around me is lasting. I now don't feel like I am.

There's so much happening around me now. I feel I'm wilting.

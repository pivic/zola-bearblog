Just saw "Louis and the nazis", a BBC-produced documentary starring Louis Theroux, in which he travels to America in search of answers. **I strongly urge you** to see the first two mind-blowing minutes of this, where he interviews the mother of Lamb and Lynx, the girls formerly known as Prussian Blue:

It's nice to see that [these girls have made some progress](http://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/07/17/071711-news-nazi-twins-1-6), despite problems with reality, e.g. accepting the Holocaust. Endearing bit fom the interview:

> They hope to enroll in college, and intend to dedicate themselves to making medical marijuana legal in all 50 states.

All in all, it's quite an enlightening documentary, from a humanistic standpoint. Theroux's way of conducting interviews is straightforward as he intentionally does not let his own persona get in the way of his questions and standpoints, which are steadfast. His meetings with Tom Metzger and Prussian Blue stand out the most as the interviewees are stupid and brain-washed, respectively.

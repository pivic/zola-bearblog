This Sunday X and I came home from an almost two-week-long stay in Oklahoma and Texas, together with our friends Malin and Bobby. The day before we were driven from Bobby's parents' house in Dallas to the airport to the tones of The Stone Roses' second album; as we hit the highway "_Drivin' South_" couldn't stop me from nearly crying over how much I'd loved the trip and wouldn't want to go. Then "_Ten Storey Love Song_" came on and I just turned silent, consciously taking everything in from the highway, from the places we'd seen, the people we'd met, the experiences I'd had. Everything came to me and I didn't want to go. I just wanted to stay, more, in some ways, than from any place I've ever been.

Tears were shed at the good-byes with our beloved Malin and Bobby at the airport. Even though I know we'll meet again, it was a hard time coming. But I'll forever be remembering the wonderful days in the car, at the restaurants, with the people, the drinks, the music and the beautiful environments. The **atmosphere**, Bog.

I'll be writing a bunch of more posts on the trip there, but as this is the first week at my new work-place, I'm kinda hectic-ed out. And tonight X and I are seeing The Magnetic Fields play live in Stockholm, wee!

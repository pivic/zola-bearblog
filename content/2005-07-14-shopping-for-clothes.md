[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-07-14-pile.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-07-14)Today Mikaela and I ventured to Liljeholmen, where Mikaela had ordered a new pair of glasses. They arrived today, so Mikaela picked them up; they're [Alan Mikli](http://www.mikli.com), brownish and very nice. Frederic met us at the optician's, and looked very tired; he had extreme problems sleeping last night. Fortunately, our neighbour is still in hospital - even though I wish for his speedy recovery, his brother still says he will most probably not return.

After Mikaela had her glasses adjusted, we left for town. We checked out [åhléns](http://www.ahlens.se) where Frederic bought [Zihr Clean](http://www.zirh.com/product.aspx?f=6) (despite hearing that [4Voo](http://www.4voo.com) is a very trendy brand) and Mikaela got tips on a specific type of lipstick. We then went to Hamngatan where we had Libanese fast-food; it was fair and helped us to move on to [NK](http://www.nk.se) where I very nearly bought a bloody good-looking shirt at Paul & Friends. I'm happy I didn't. Read on.

We had water, bananas, ice-cream (well, I did), coffee; careened, veered and at last fitted ourselves snugly in at [Tjallamalla](http://www.tjallamalla.com), one of the best retailers of clobber in Stockholm. Their concept is very good: they proffer well-made, exquisite clothes by up-and-coming designers, often available in very limited quantities, and also very select second-hand clothes They've recently opened [a web-shop](http://shoppa.tjallamalla.com) and as I just wrote, mind that their physical shop contains loads more, due to the beforementioned fact. Mikaela found herself a lovely dress that she bought (while she asked the owners to stow away a jacket) and I found a beautiful, brown leather jacket that I'll more than likely get tomorrow...when Mikaela and I will return to Tjallamalla to check out what we had stowed away for us. Moaha! New clobber.

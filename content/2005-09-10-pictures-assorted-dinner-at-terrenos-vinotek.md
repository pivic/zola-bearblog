[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-09-09-collagethumb.jpg)](http://www.niklasblog.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=364)I snapped [this gallery](http://www.niklasblog.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=364) yesterday; it contains some pictures taken during my wait for a delayed train, but most from the evening, when we ate at [Terrenos Vinotek](http://www.terrenosvinotek.se), a quite mediocre restaurant in the north part of Stockholm city.

Fortunately, a mate had tipped me off saying the food wasn't very much to have, but the wine was interesting: they provided a wine-jukebox. You pay for a card that carries a fixed amount of money (100, 200 or 500 SKR) which you pop into a slot of the wine jukebox. Thereafter you put your glass under the snout of the wine you want to drink, push a button and you get 4cl's of wine. One of the snouts offered grappa, though. Most wines were OK, and the idea of it all is excellent. One could easily get hold of water next to said jukebox. The food and service was different, though; the waiter turned non-attentive as soon as the main courses were dished out. One of my work-mates said the first course he had, oven-grilled olives, was very boring in flavour. Said olives didn't contain any pips, which rings untrue in my book. The main-course for me, was the bean-salad. It was heavy on salt, very low on any other spices, and the beans were fair, but not much more. The rest of the plate contained salad-leaves and a few slices of tomatoe, which were so old they squished when I tried to cut them with the sharp cutlery. Bad sign, people.

The rest of the company seemed fairly amazed when they received their main-courses, for instance, Perch Soffrito, consisting of perch and no more; these persons rushed to order the risotto - when the waiter finally arrived. Too bad the experience of dining there was drab, but the company was nice.

The dinner was held to honour Annekaisa, who until recently has worked with the rest of us who were at the dinner, and is now working a lot closer to home. It was nice meeting her. Travelling a long way to work almost every day can be hell if one is in her position, rearing three kids; her husband travels a lot, which means she is the sole care-taker when he's away. That's a 24-hour-job. I can't even imagine how exhausting it must be.

Anyway, after the dining extravaganza, Alex, Robin and I ventured into the night to find a place to eat. I decided to go home, where I had a couple of slices of the delicious fruit-nuts-and-raisins-bread from Rivalbageriet, and then to bed. Mmm-good.

This weekend, [Dagens Nyheter](http://dn.se) published a special on coffee in Stockholm.

A friend of a friend, who works for [Kaffemaskinen](http://kaffemaskinen.se) and is, to say the least, extremely passionate about coffee helped the journalist notably with said article. A little time after this, a sales-person from Dagens Nyheter called the man and asked if the company he worked for would like to put an ad in the special, which was due out.

An ad that would appear in the special would cost 25000SKR (3500USD), an ad that would appear alongside the special would cost 50000SKR (7000USD) and if you wanted your company _to be mentioned in the article_ you'd have to pay 75000SKR (10500USD).

What a sack of crap that article turned out, then.

You honestly thought you'd get away with my not releasing a best-of-the-year post, you unlucky Beast? Hell to the no! Here 'tis, your Bible and rulebook, what gives you milk and cookies when you come cryin' down the stairs because of monster under ya bed, so go purchase all of the recommended below and should you own anything that I don't like, burn it. Otherwise, my Style Police will come to your door, stare you in the face as your pets will be removed forcefully, your grandmother thrown off a train and I will stand before you saying "You didn't do right!" while sporting 80's clothing. Or make-up. Or both! So beware, take heed, and duly note:

## Albums

In no special order, here are my fave twelve record releases of the year.

**[Okkervil River](http://okkervilriver.com)** - "[The Stand Ins](http://www.jagjaguwar.com/onesheet.php?cat=JAG124)"

![The Stand Ins](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-okkervilriver.jpg)Will Sheff is a modern-day renaissance man who thinks that people feel like actors in a big drama, making romantic decisions, chasing dreams that are divorced from reality, based on promises fed through TV, films, magazines, books and music - without anyone to stitch them together. This album, the follow-up (or appendix, if you will) to last year's "The Stage Names", deals with many a subject attached to being in a band, lyrically as well as how the world around OR has shaped itself of late; members have passed and joined, videos have been made and an entire cover-project - that [X](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com) and I [are part of](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg7U--yXjf0) - has been laid before our feet. ((Speaking of which, in December a year ago, OR freely gave us "Golden Opportunities", a collection of covers; it's still available, through their site.)) Will's voice is better than ever, and I'm patiently waiting for new songs.

[**SebastiAn**](http://www.myspace.com/0sebastian0) - "Motor EP"

![Motor EP](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-sebastian.jpg)When I first heard him, it was through [Justice's Coachella mixtape](http://muxtape.com/remembers/thrillistcoachella) which was released through the now-defunct muxtape.com. I was floored by SebastiAn's groovy, mechanical swing; it was as if somebody had recorded a young, hungry punk band and the engineer had pushed all the levers to the max, fucking the sound up. The energy of tracks like "_Momy_" and "_Army_". And if there's doubt of what he's capable of, check out the gruelling "_[Dog](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhAszq6lrz4)_", nicked from the Ed Banger label's third compilation, "[Ed Rec Vol. 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Rec_Vol._3)".

**[Portishead](http://www.portishead.co.uk)** - "Third"

![Third](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-portishead.jpg)Having scrapped work that would have made up an entire album in order to work from anew because they were afraid of sounding like "a Portishead cover band", this emerged; 11 years in the making, "Third" proved what most already knew, i.e. that their two previous albums weren't results of fluke. The only real hard time I have with this album is whether or not to say it's their best yet; granted, "_Machine Gun_" is not my favourite track, but listening to a song like the 70s-wafting, progressive, harrowing, groovy and album-opening "_Silence_", I'm theirs.

**[Booka Shade](http://www.bookashade.com)** - "The Sun And The Neon Light"

![The Sun And The Neon Light](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-bookashade.jpg)When I first heard this album, I didn't think much of it. I let it run in the background while I rode the subway from and to work. The second time, I found myself listening actively to what went on, and wondered why I was reacting this strong to a house album. No offense, I've got all the time in the world for good house, it's just that I haven't heard anything this good in such a long time. This is well thought-out and composed music that I strongly recommend.

[**Girl Talk**](http://www.myspace.com/girltalkmusic) - "[Feed The Animals](http://74.124.198.47/illegal-art.net/__girl__talk___feed__the__anima.ls___/)"

![Feed The Animals](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-girltalk.jpg)If sampling were a crime, Gregg Gillis would be doing time. His record label is named [Illegal Art](http://splendidezine.com/features/illegal/) and his albums consist of small strands of own electronic sounds, segueing many samples of songs by loads of other artists. Thing is, Mr. Gillis has a penchant for making groovy stuff. Too much of his music quickly becomes...too much to my ears, but I think this is the best he's done so far and just enough to make you go bonkers. My man Zak lays down the law accurately, so check out [his post](http://zakdaddys.blogspot.com/2008/07/girl-talk.html) for why you should be doing half-assed moves to this shit at 4AM in the moanin'!

**[CSS](http://www.myspace.com/canseidesersexy)** - "Donkey"

![Donkey](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-css.jpg)I'll say! After having shoved Lovefoxxx's ass from off X's face I wondered if things could get worse. They did - my own assuming this band wouldn't do better than their debut album! Right now, with "Donkey", I'm saying they're even on top of Bonde Do Role! They've - in my eyes, of course - here performed a twist similar to that of Arctic Monkeys' last year, by releasing a more mature follow-up to their debut album. Filled with hooks, great choruses, stabs and experimental vibe, this is one of the most well-produced and loveable albums of the year.

**[Lady GaGa](http://www.ladygaga.com)** - "The Fame"

![The Fame](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-ladygaga.jpg)Even though some criticise Stefani Joanne Germanotta for doing things that others have done before - _hellaou_, who hellacares if she does? While her songs are brilliant pop tweaks that induce dance and wylding out, imagine this - her whole album is just like that: ass-shaking, funny, funky with enough melodies to make you think the 80s has been reinvented in a great way. GaGa herself reminds me of Swedish artist Leila K in her heyday, but is more illustrious than that, having written songs for Britney Spears, Pussycat Dolls and New Kids on the Block. Come to Stockholm now, damn it! ((Apparently, she's coming here on Friday. WTF! Found that out the day after I wrote that! I'm psychic! I'm psychic! Or rather the other way around. I'm superstitious! Eh... I'm a mammal! No, I give up. Language is no longer a friend of mine. Damn, this footnote kinda grew and never quit. Will it, ever?))

[**Soulwax**](http://www.soulwax.com), [**Justice**](http://www.myspace.com/etjusticepourtous) - "Part Of The Weekend Never Dies", "A Cross The Universe"

![Part Of The Weekend Never Dies and A Cross The Universe](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-soulwaxjustice.jpg)Although these two albums are made by different bands, I will not review them apart. They're like two separate beasts intertwined. To make matters worse, I must say that **Soulwax** is the winner, hands down, although Justice worked hard at emerging triumphant. Both albums are signs of vitality, strokes on a canvas reflecting how electronic music fuses punk with beats that were once born in Africa when humanity was born. A monumental groove which works best with Soulwax, whose album consists of live musicians performing the remixed version of their album "Any Minute Now", called "Nite Versions", while throwing DJ'ing into the ordeal. This is no different than what Stockhausen and even Kraftwerk did in their early existence, but then again, can you show me an album like theirs? An album that makes you feel a bit like the first time you heard Daft Punk's seminal album "Homework"? The force from the live feel of the album is undeniably very strong, and the filmed documentary that accompanies the album is very strong; together, you have a potion that moves mountains; when they remix their own songs live and suddenly add T99's "[_Anastasia_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o_3dQ4AQ6c)", re-evolving into a completely sweat-drenched beast...you lose it.

As far as **Justice** are concerned, it's a known fact that [they aren't exactly playing live](http://ffffound.com/image/8afbd218f448bfb1d17b37234694b7df0f2359f1?c=2015641), but their mixing capabilities are at times so good they're completely beyond touch, evoking shouts of "Genius!" from the rafters. At times, their so-called live album indeed make you D.A.N.C.E., but it can't hold a candle to Soulwax's effort.

**[TV On The Radio](http://www.tvontheradio.com)** - "Dear Science"

![Dear Science](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-tvontheradio.jpg)I liked "Return To Cookie Mountain" but I _really_ like "Dear Science". Although I think the main difference has to do with the way this album is more rock-shaped than the more destitute previous album, there's something about the sound in this one which separates them. So, what about the rest? The song and lyrics; Tunde Adebimpe's dark and illustrious voice makes way as a true instrument of its kind - at the same time reminding me of Saul Williams' great poetic voce - while the synths and loops leave The Killers' recent album in the dirt. And the guitars! Oh, my. It's art.

**[Bon Iver](http://www.boniver.org)** - "[For Emma, Forever Ago](http://www.jagjaguwar.com/onesheet.php?cat=jag115)"

![For Emma, Forever Ago](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-boniver.jpg)With this re-release courtesy of Jagjaguwar, Bon Iver really turned up in the limelight of things. X and I saw the band about two days after she discovered them, and I tried my best to listen in to what the album was about. Immense sadness and grief, torment and anger, all enveloped in gentle words and harmonics that blew my mind when performed live; it's little wonder that this album (and band) has gone into my heart to remain there for the time being. Here's a video of their gig that X shot. The song is "_Re: Stacks_":

## What I should have covered last year

**[Holy Fuck](http://www.myspace.com/holyfuck)** - "LP"

![LP](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-holyfuck.jpg)OK, so I've covered [this lot live at Way Out West](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1633), but their album deserves a lot of high-lighting. This is experimental, nonsensical, dada and crazy grooviness that only people like Super Furry Animals, Kraftwerk, Beastie Boys, Atari Teenage Riot, Dinosaur Jr. and James Brown can come up with, when the feeling is right, the time is right and they actually commit their ish to record. The track "_Lovely Allen_" pole-vaulted these guys into the indie mainstream with its catchy riff but it's their melodic droning that caught my ear and transformed this into a band to be reckoned with. Check out [their Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/holyfuck) and get both of their albums now.

**Robert Plant and Alison Krauss** - "Raising Sand"

![Raising Sand](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-plantkrauss.jpg)I should have known that Robert Plant, singer of Led Zeppelin, had it in him to sing the sweetest, most carefully whispered tones of blues in minor that you'd be likely to hear in a long time, but stupidly, I cared about this album way too late, until a colleague of mine tipped me off. Alison Krauss is amazing in her dueting with Plant, and as none other than [T-Bone Burnett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Bone_Burnett) has produced this - and played wonderful guitar on ten of the tracks - this is the most uncovered album you're likely to hear in a long time.

## Discovered this year

**[Shinichi Osawa](http://www.myspace.com/shinichiosawa)** - "The One"

The best house/techno I've uncovered in ages, reminiscent to Orbital yet at the same time very special; his covering The Chemical Brothers' "Star Guitar" and bettering the track says a lot about how great I think he is. The album contains a few tracks that are so-and-so, but as a whole, this is unique.

**[Hanson](http://www.hanson.net)** - "Middle Of Nowhere"

OK, laugh at me, bitches, but this is a great album! As produced by The Dust Brothers, I thought this might contain a few interesting samples and scratches - which it does - but backing all of this you've got a firm base in the shape of great pop tracks, and don't let your prejudice fool ya!

**[The 1990s](http://www.myspace.com/1990sband)** - "Cookies"

The true one Glaswegian band to have caught my attention this year, having released an album filled with panache, cockiness, garage rock and great, bad lyrics. Do check them out.

## Wishy-washy

**David Holmes** - "The Holy Pictures"

Some of the tracks, e.g. "_The Ballad of Sarah and Jack_" are just harrowing and lovely, while others are just...there. All in all, this is a good album, but compared with his two previous ones, history will hold it against him. You can do better, Dave!

**Immortal Technique** - “The Middle Passage“

Finally released, but sadly, it was all known territory. Although I must say, the song "_Mistakes_" is absolutely brilliant and there's no other rapper quite like him, combining Noam Chomsky and cheap laughs; yeah, he's the Bill Hicks of hip-hop.

## Disappointments

**Dirty Pretty Things** - "Romance At Short Notice"

What the fuck happened? Carl! You were so close to twisting Pete's fingers and giving him carpet burns, and the single "_Tired of England_" was so lovely, but...what? The first album was hungry, vibrant and young, and this one was worked over and over, and I did see the danger signs when Alan McGee stated it was "great" and "arty"; it was _arty_, but not great. Comparing the two albums DPT left as their legacy is like comparing Ramones' first album to the one produced by Phil Spector; it's still Ramones, but not as we know it - and the not-so-great one is rather daft when it comes down to it, right? Still, we all hoped for a genius comeback but alas, will The Albion ever veer back in triumph? I've got more hopes for Mr. Barât than for 99% of pop-making society, so here's a toast to his previous efforts, and strong hopes for 2009!

**Glasvegas' debut album as opposed to their singles**

I wasn't expecting a whole album filled to the brim with _Geraldine_s, but I definitely wasn't expecting filler like what plopped into our laps. Despite the entire lovely girliness of the 50s Phil Spector-sound mashed with what The Jesus and Mary Chain once brought to Glasvegas' conscience, I'm just sad that they didn't diversify their album more, especially considering how much better their sound and allure worked on their singles, definitely including the b-sides. It's not a case of less is more; it's "[The Pipettes](http://allconsuming.net/entry/view/26718)" all over again!

**MRK1**

I won't even go into this as I loved his brilliant album "Copyright Laws", but listening to his recent vinyls would probably be like managing to hit Dubya with shoes: hard work.

**Guns n' Roses** - "Chinese Democracy"

I've said all I need to say [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=2020); even though proffering critique in this instance is a bit like kicking a dead horse, I still have to do it in order to try and save future metalheads from not discovering their beautiful debut album "Appetite For Destruction".

## Reissue, repackage, repackage

**Morrissey** - "Greatest Hits"

Relying heavily on his newer albums for ammunition, I feel he opted for the release of this compilation because he a) didn't care for the olden greatest hits, legion as they are in numbers, b) wants to show the world how much he loves his latest tracks and perchance c) wishes to parlay a few tracks from off his coming album, "Years Of Refusal". I've made [my own "Morrissey's Greatest Hits"](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1393), thank you.

**Beck** - "Odelay \[deluxe edition\]"

Ah yes, another 2 CD version of an epic album. Did it do any good? Well, yes. This is my favourite album by the man, incidentally produced by The Dust Brothers - see Hanson, above - and the bonus tracks are definitely worth this purchase. By the way, here's bit of a funny press release that was issued after this version hit the streets:

> The first pressing of the recent Odelay: Deluxe Edition was found to have gone out with un-proofed lyrics that were taken from a lyrics website as placeholders for layout purposes. Beck apologizes for this unfortunate oversight and is making arrangements for the corrected lyrics to be available gratis via Beck.com. Subsequent pressings of the Odelay: Deluxe Edition will also include the corrected lyrics.

Quite funny considering how the real lyrics were first actually just placeholders to begin with!

**New Order** - "[Low-Life (2 CD Collector's Edition)](http://www.rhino.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=516184)"

Unlike the shame that The Cure's remastered "Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me" was, this is really worth buying. Apart from the fact that I think this is their best album - on a divided first place together with "Technique" - this is where Joy Division and New Order came apart for me, while showing what massive potential they still had. The second CD contains 12" versions of many tracks, but notably the 17:28 version of "_Elegia_", guaranteed to blow minds. This album is 80s pop, electro, harrowing harmonies; doom meets glee and I love it.

**R.E.M.** - "[Murmur \[deluxe\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murmur_(album))"

The first things I knew about this album were that "murmur" is one of the most easily pronouncable words in the English language and that all band members individually, without any other member knowing about it, approached producer [Stephen Hague](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hague) and asked him to lower the volume of their instrument/voice. With that in mind, having also learned that the band refused to record any "rock music clichés" (e.g. guitar-solos and synthesizers), I listened to this deluxe edition and was taken over instantly. Despite having listened a lot to "Automatic For The People" and "Monster", I find this to be their best album, and the second disc - containing a live concert - is nice.

## Looking forward to in 2009

**Morrissey** - "Years Of Refusal" \[to be released 2009-02-16\]

Yep, it's coming, and although [some have already reviewed it](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2008/dec/11/morrissey-years-of-refusal-review) - haven't the rest of us, if only a tad? Of the twelve tracks making it to the LP, two (("_That's How People Grow Up_" and "_All You Need Is Me_".)) have already been released. Still, I long for this like the company of a long lost friend. Come hither, please. Please. I know I'll probably sit in awe and shock when the melodies hit me. I wonder if Alain's written any of the tracks.

**[Lightning Bolt](http://laserbeast.com)** - "Funny Farm"

Nobody knows when this album will be released, but judging from how I think their albums become better by each release, this might be one of the very best albums of 2009. Of course, providing it will surface at all.

**[Andrew Bird](http://www.andrewbird.net)** - "Noble Beast" \[to be released 2008-01-20\]

Yes, it's leaked, and yes, a little bird's ((Pun originally not intended, promise.)) told me it's better than last year's "Armchair Apocrypha", so get saving! There's a special ((According to Bird's site, it's special edition, deluxe edition _and_ limited edition all in one...someone betta getcha faxtrait, beeyatches!)) version out there, which means 2 CD!

**Iran** - "Dissolver" \[to be released 2008-02-03\]

Kyp Malone, guitarist from TV On The Radio, is member of Iran, who are releasing their first new album in seven years. Good riddance! It's already leaked onto the Internets, and birds chirp about it being very good.

**Otherwise**: Anything released from Ed Banger. An album by Daft Punk? Simian Mobile Disco, Shitdisco, Einstürzende Neubauten, Super Furry Animals' instrumental album.

## Best festival

ATP. None other like it. This ruled all. Notes by me found [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1473), [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1480) and [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1471). Hey and cheers to Agnes and Mike!

## Other lists

X's posted her [best of -08](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2008/12/10/best-of-08), which I seem to copy to no end, while The Guardian have [their critics' poll](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/series/critics-poll-2008) where they actually posted Bon Iver at #1, a few hours later to bump them down to #2, placing TV On The Radio at #1. I'm not with you on that one! last.fm have posted a [Best of 2008-list](http://www.last.fm/bestof/2008), based on what people have listened to the most during the past year; artists, albums and tracks are given their respective lists. Not surprisingly, Portishead's "Third" end up high as it was streamed in its entirety for a week prior to release, exclusively on last.fm. "Ghosts" by Nine Inch Nails is a freely downloadable album. Coldplay #1. Enough said. PopMatters also love [several lists](http://www.popmatters.com/pm/special/section/popmatters-picks-the-best-music-of-2008). And [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1385)'s my list of the best music of 2007.

## And finally...cover of the year

**Mystery Jets** - "Bleeding Love" ((Yep, the original being done by Leona Lewis, as written by that guy from One Republic. This track is only available for a week, and then gone!))

\[audio:https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-16-bleedinglove.mp3\]

I haven't been writing as I've been working. _Work_. Work. Work. I've been up to my ears in it. I'm not for litanies, so here are links I've saved throughout the week.

Even though the recent chills (appx. -9 degrees Celsius here in Stockholm for the past week, with endless bouts of snow) we don't have a tough enough time near to compare with what [these people](http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/01/20/news/russia.php) are going through.

[Futurama will return](http://digg.com/movies/Futurama_to_return_in_DVD_form_) as full feature films - on DVD. At last.

Anonymity through booting a CD from your computer? Check [this article from Wired Magazine](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/internet/0,70017-0.html), and you'll get it. I've actually tried it, and it works beautifully. Everything you surf, e-mail or IM is sent through encrypted channels, past whatever operating system's on the computer and there's no way for any biter to find out what your IP-address is. Perfect for people living in oppressed countries where their government scans their communication, say, Nepal, China, Indonesia, the USA. Speaking of that, if you want to use an encrypted version of Firefox through a USB-memory, just check [this program](http://www.freehaven.net/~arrakis/torpark.html). 8MB's in size, and all the info you need is there.

[Here's a grand interview with Noam Chomsky](http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/?q=node/6801). An excerpt from the top, even though the interview spans several very interesting, highly international subjects:

> Geov Parrish: Is George Bush in political trouble? And if so, why?
> 
> Noam Chomsky: George Bush would be in severe political trouble if there were an opposition political party in the country. Just about every day, they're shooting themselves in the foot. The striking fact about contemporary American politics is that the Democrats are making almost no gain from this. The only gain that they're getting is that the Republicans are losing support. Now, again, an opposition party would be making hay, but the Democrats are so close in policy to the Republicans that they can't do anything about it. When they try to say something about Iraq, George Bush turns back to them, or Karl Rove turns back to them, and says, "How can you criticize it? You all voted for it." And, yeah, they're basically correct.

You've got a GMail account and are running Windows? Check [this program](http://www.viksoe.dk/code/gmail.htm) to create a virtual GMail disk, enabling you to drag-and-drop files into (and, of course, from) your GMail account. Works great for me.

You want a colour-painting of Osama Bin Ladin with E.T.? Of course you do. By Harmony Korine? We can do that too. Just click [here](http://www.iconoclastusa.com/store/product.asp?id=1511).

A couple of days ago I was tipped of [SlimServer](http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_features.html) to stream my music through the net, but I actually prefer [kPlaylist](http://www.kplaylist.net) a lot more. Just install a MySQL server and you're on your way. Just drop me a line of you need help with it.

Need a way to download your fave TV shows from the net? I've heard that [ted](http://www.rulecam.net/ted) is a good program to help you do it, so check it out. If you wanna search for video on the net, I've heard that [Truveo](http://www.truveo.com) is the search-engine of choice, past [Google Video](http://video.google.com).

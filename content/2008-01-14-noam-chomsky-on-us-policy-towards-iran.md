A lot of people seem to want the USA to invade Iran. Why?

Yesterday [George W. Bush stated that Iran is threatening the security of the world](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080113.wbush13/BNStory/International/home) and the United States and Arab allies must join together to confront the danger "before it's too late".

In 1953 the American and British (respective) governments overthrew the democratically elected leader and instated a dictator who ruled until 1979, when the population overthrew him and his government. After that, the USA has been against Iran, e.g. trying to assist in a military coup against the government and supporting people like Saddam Hussein (especially during the Iraqi war against Iran). Then, the US government issued sanctions.

As I love to regurgitate [Noam Chomsky](http://www.chomsky.info), here are a few choice words from the video displayed below:

> The basic assumption, underlying the discussion, is that we own the world. So, if we invade and occupy another country, so it's a criminal act to interfere with it.

That's pretty bold. Has he anything to compare that with?

> But what about the nuclear weapons? Are there any countries with nuclear weapons in the region? Israel has a couple of hundred of nuclear weapons. The United States gives more support to it than any other nation in the world.

That's pretty...horrid. I'm sure Dubya and his pals are doing something about that, though. Right?

Erhm. No. George W. Bush held a press conference on 2007-10-17, where he stated that the US government wouldn't "permit" anybody hosting nuclear weapons. Except for Israel, I guess. And any other states that dance along to the American tune.

A few years ago, the Iranian government agreed to stop their enrichment of uranium (which is a must, if you want to create nuclear weapons), in order for the US government not to go ahead with its threats and eventually destroy Iran (as it did with Iraq). This was agreed upon with the European Union, who didn't live up to their obligations on this agreement and hence, the Iranian government continued to enrich uranium. And the American government carries on.

Check the news-clip below on this, as it's only 8 minutes of your time. It's scary, and good.

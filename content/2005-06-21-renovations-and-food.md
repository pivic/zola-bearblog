[Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-06-21)'s another gallery of food and renovations. As you'll see, Mikaela's been devouring IKEA-furniture which she's chucked out on the balcony. It's made the balcony a lot more lush, first and foremost because of the greens everywhere - not to mention our assortment of fresh herbs she uses a lot in her cooking - but also because of the cane furniture. Sure, there's only room for one single chair, but it's nice. Very nice.

Now it's time to head to [Tierp](http://www.tierp.se), where Staffan and Patrik have a country-side cottage. Ciao!

Friday was amazing.

Not only did most friends who visited do so for the first time, but were forced to SingStar the night away with us. People didn't leave until half past four in the morning, and I stayed till the very end!

X, the love of my life, and I made a little starter consisting of baguette, olive oil, mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil leaf. Simple. Perfect.

[Tessa and her boyfriend Tomas](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3396058523/) came by for the first time, as did [Jenny](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3397881634/) and [Erika](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3396869760/). [Björn](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3396057261/) showed up a little later and we doused the night in splendid, extremely funny, interesting, nonsensical and varied conversation, dancing and singing, of course. This was, after all, a party in the sign of [SingStar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SingStar).

We ate a little, drank some and just plain partied. It was refreshing to end the working week in this fashion.

SingStar Queen helped a bit, I'll tell you. I love [Queen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%20%28band%29). I think a lot of people carry their torch as a guilty pleasure, but I don't. They were great, apart from a whole bunch of duff songs. OK, so "_Flash_" isn't on this title, but really, who thought it was going to be? As Björn said, it's comprised of the chorus, but mostly of seemingly random quotes from the film and sound-effects. Singing "_Don't Stop Me Now_" with Björn was a complete highlight and hearing him and Erika sing "_Who Wants To Live Forever?_" was so bitter-sweet.

When the night ended, it was 04:30 in the morning, and I was very happy. Not too much, not too little. And it was all love. Here's a glass raised to friends, you guys make it all worth it. Here's the obligatory slide-show:

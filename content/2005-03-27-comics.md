Today there's been hubbub regarding graphic novels that are on their way to be turned into films. [This article](http://www.chromewaves.net/?itemid=1722) is very good for reading up on the subject.

Two of Alan Moore's supreme graphic novels, "[V For Vendetta](http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com)" and "[Watchmen](http://www.watchmenmovie.com)", are in for it. "V" is just now being shot by The Wachowskis and Joel Silver, which either means stuff will be blown up every three seconds, or it'll turn out good. Gathering how the Matrix trilogy fell, quality-wise, I keep my hopes very, very low. Think "[Daredevil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287978)" low.

Speaking of graphic novels, I've just ordered a complete set of [Grant Morrison](http://www.grant-morrison.com)'s "[The Invisibles](http://www.barbelith.com/bomb)", together with "V For Vendetta" as my previous copy was stolen. A lot of people say [the Wachowski brothers, who directed the "Matrix films", stole a lot of stuff from "The Invisibles"](http://www.fortunecity.com/tatooine/niven/142/recycleb/rb40.html), and I'll just have to see that for myself. I loved Morrison's "[The Filth](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1840237392)", by the way, marvellous surreal novel.

On comics: I'm curious about "[Flight Volume One](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1582403813)", an anthology showing a lot of new penners grabbing some of the lime-light. I haven't read it, but it's supposed to be a lot of different comics with "flight" as theme throughout them all. Could be crap, could be good, but a few pages are intriguing.

"[Flight Volume Two](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1582404771)" is about to drop soon, and [the web site](http://www.flightcomics.com/flight2_preview.htm) seems to contain a few interesting bits.

Rade came over this week-end! Yes! And we rocked. He came over on Saturday, just after Mikaela and I had gone for a walk during which I snapped [this picture of a little squirrel](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/44751653). Whateva! So Rade came and had brought a billion chocolate-cases from a newly opened chocolate-shop in Eskilstuna. We had a few of the Grand Cru-selection most of which were very tasty. Dark chocolate reigns supreme. I must go to [Chokladfabriken](http://www.chokladfabriken.com) soon.

So Rade and I attacked "[Burnout Revenge](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=niklasblog-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/B000930DIM)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)". It's such a dog-gone fast game, even players with extreme ADD must think that game's incredibly fast. In this edition you ram your car into others by shunting them from behind (...) which actually means there's a lot more carnage this time around. Did I mention it's fast? It's _fast_: tunnel-vision is included, and I like the fact that one can pick a number of different routes per track, and everything's better-looking this time around. The music is better, even though I miss a few tracks off "Burnout 3". Among the new ones you've got LCD Soundsystem remixed by Soulwax, The Bravery remixed by Superdiscount and...a very dodgy remix of The Doors' "Break On Through".

Mikaela made a very nice salmon dinner. Oven-baked salmon with oven-grilled vegetables was excellent and we had a nice chablis with that.

In the evening, Rade and I drank and got dank. We watched a slew of funny stuff on the TV and played the night through, while drinking vodka, gin and I called Kristin and got Rade to speak to her - politics abound! Child labour comments flew! We partied hard thereafter, played a lot of Deicide, Megadeth, and a lot of west coast hip-hop. Oh I love that. If you think Deicide is just another satanistic idiot band, think again! Read this lyric to "[Bastard of Christ](http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=15500&count=no)". If that's not enough, check this one out for "[Slave To The Cross](http://lyrics.rockmagic.net/lyrics/deicide/serpents_of_the_light_1997.html#06)". Visionaries! Anyway we crashed at 03:30, woo-hah!

The day after we took everything very easy. Rade's sister, [Tamara](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/44739228), came over and blessed us with her presence; she's so similar to my sister it's uncanny. They're both extremely ADD, energetic, fighting (!) and are quick-thinking. I shudder to think what would happen if they'd meet!

In the evening we went to Cirkus, a concert place in Stockholm - nowadays unfortunately owned and controlled by Clear Channel, the American-christian right-wing group - where [Eddie Izzard](http://www.eddieizzard.com) was going to perform. YEAY! Mikaela, Rade and I packed up and headed there, where three Swedish stand-up comedians performed before Eddie went on. Big mistake - mostly. First up was Adde Malmberg, who's one of the most boring people I've heard. His jokes are sub-par moronic discourse. I'll give you an example, but first I have to explain a couple of things: 1) he's from Skåne, which is located far south in Sweden. We live in Stockholm, which is smack in the middle. 2) in the Stockholmian subway-system the routes are often referred to by colour, from the maps over the subway system. During the past years there has been extensive reparations done on the green line, which means that trains on that line are traditionally late. Here's one of Adde Malmberg's jokes:

> So, in Stockholm you say, whenever you're late...that you've taken a train on the green line. Yeah! You always do, you people. The green line! Late! \[massive laugh from moronic members of the audience\] And you know what? \[does moronic-sounding voice\] 'Oh, I'm not _late_, I just rode on the green line!' \[more moronic laughter\]

I remember [Bill Hicks](http://www.billhicks.com) doing one of his good lines, which went something like this: "Jesus murdered; Martin Luther King murdered; Malcolm X murdered; Gandhi murdered; John Lennon murdered; Reagan ... wounded." In case you didn't know, Bill Hicks is dead, and...Adde Malmberg apparently lives. AAAH! Thank Bog that Eddie Izzard doesn't know Swedish. Then another moron followed, and the last comedian was Henrik Schyffert. He was semi-boring, but said some funny stuff about how him and the other two comedians couldn't possibly compete with Izzard because...they sucked in comparison. Touché! Self-imposed irony is always a kicker, and Schyffert did it quite well. After the two retards and Schyffert had done their bit, there was a pause for 30 minutes, and then Eddie came on - not wearing drag! God **damn it**! What's the deal? You're going out, so dress for the occation, bitch! In case you haven't noticed, [I like the cross-dressing fucker](https://niklasblog.com/?p=341), but he wasn't very good this time around. I mean, he was strong in the sense that he was quick and (seemingly) improvised a lot, but the material wasn't at all up to scratch with "Dress To Kill" or "Definite Article". I miss that! He did a few old jokes, but mostly new material, but 40 minutes of jokes on animals was a bit tedious. Like Rade said, his first lines on the WTC-crash on 2001-09-11 was good stuff, but then he just went downhill slightly. His joke about Darth Vader on the Death Star was extremely well-done, but the show was NOT worth the 450SKR (appx. 60USD) we doshed out - a piece.

So we came home and were all very tired. Rade went on a one-hour trip to Eskilstuna, happy him. [Here's a little gallery](http://www.niklasblog.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=610) of pictures from the week-end, Rade-centered. Too bad most of the pictures are bad, but there you go.

This morning I felt like shit, but went to work anyway. After a few hours I started to feel very cold, froze and felt like I was going to puke a few times. Lovely! So I went home a couple of hours early. Nice one. Let's see if I'll stay home tomorrow.

Oh, and I've picked up a few links for you. [Here'](http://www.mediamonkey.com)s Media Monkey, a little media library program that's free and enables you to synch a variety of audio-players with it.

You know what a pain it is to reinstall your favourite software following a computer change/reinstallation? Finding the apps, downloading them, installing them - unchecking that damned Google Toolbar - and then doing it again for the next time? Might be time to check this out as Windows 7 is out and it's reinstall time for a lot of us.

I really like [Ninite](http://ninite.com) ((Formerly known as Volery, they re-launched yesterday with a new name and site.)) for this.

All you do, is visit their site, check the boxes for the apps you want, click the "Get installer" button and download the small exe-file. Run that file on an Internet-connected computer, and the apps are now downloaded, installed without crapware such as the Google Toolbar and the likes, and you're off.

Almost all of the apps - except for Microsoft Office, of course - are freeware, and as I've used this site during the beta phase I've seen more and more apps getting included.

Brilliant, and totally free.

By the way, if you're an admin, check [this page](http://ninite.com/info/advanced) for their info on the coming premium fixes, which are however at the time of writing this available for all.

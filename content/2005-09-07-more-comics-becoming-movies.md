[From Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/06/2230210), Hollywood is now bound for more unoriginal pap:

> Marvel has raised $525 million to independently finance 10 movies based on its comics over seven years. The titles named are Captain America, The Avengers, Nick Fury, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Cloak & Dagger, Dr. Strange, Hawkeye, Power Pack and Shang-Chi. The company's also changing its name from Marvel Enterprises to Marvel Entertainment.

It's interesting to see comics turning into films, _if_ it makes them more interesting. I'm guessing "V For Vendetta" will turn out a really crap film. I also believe - and I'm not bitter about this, just assuming the worst, which Hollywood always seems to top - that it will put people off the chance that they might read the comic. I've yelled about how much I love this comic [before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=200), so I won't do it again - but it's so good.

Another interesting thing about this film is the Wachowski brothers. They robbed Grant Morrison's "[The Invisibles](http://www.barbelith.com/bomb)" of its great story, a lot of the characters and the events taking place - and I've not even read the first entire volume of the collections of Invisibles-books I bought a while back! Now they're bank-rolling "V For Vendetta", writing parts of it, work as second-unit directors and generally hover over the project as if they were the Miramax Brothers. Yet again, I implore you to read why [Alan Moore dropped out of the project and pulled one of his series from DC Comics as a result](http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&article=2153).

Come on, Hollywood! Let the writers who produce original material shine! No wonder people download films instead of paying to see them, if they're plain and very unoriginal.

[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-07-09-pile.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-07-09)Yesterday we went to Bauhaus, where Frederic bought himself a new carpet for his balcony. While there, somebody asked him if he'd gotten hold of his new t-shirt for free from Beckers, a supplier of paint. As said shirt hails from Paul Smith and Frederic hence probably has bought it for a lot of cash, I guess he swore under his breath as he said "No" very carefully.

After that we went home and I made pasta putana, a form of poor-man's dish with a Jamie Oliver twist. It's basically penne rigate with a tuna-tomatoe sauce; the tuna is first marinated with a liquid consisting of bashed basil, lemon juice and zest, plus spices. Boil the pasta. You then fry the marinated stuff with chopped garlic, a bit of chili and throw in the pasta. Disco! It's done. Thanks to the lemon it's a very fresh dish.

Frederic had brought a vintage Moà«t & Chandon, which carried a bready taste. We had a red wine for dinner, but it wasn't just right for the food. Anyway - Frederic and I left for Slick, [where we couldn't get in last week](https://niklasblog.com/?p=687). We came in very early, and were greeted with -60 SKR for entrance and then faced with no wardrobe. Say whut? No wardrobe, but thanks to a very understanding bartender we could leave our jackets behind the bar, kudos!

The DJ's played tacky r 'n' b, but after I had words, they played Eric B. & Rakim's "Don't Sweat The Technique" - which I was required to dance to. I spoke with the guy who now runs Slick, and he was very different than I remembered from last time, when Frederic and I DJ'ed for him. I wouldn't say he was suave this time around, more like cynical. The time before he was very talkative, happy about us playing music and spoke constantly of Pixies (the band). This time he wasn't very interested in anything, but maybe that comes with running a very successful club?

I left after a while, during which I was dancing and had lost Frederic and Anka. Just as I got my jacket I met Frederic and Anka. Frederic was very dazed, appeared very drunk and was wobbling. Weird, that, considering I'd probably had more to drink than he had (even though my three last drinks were water). The day after, I learned that Frederic had been drugged by somebody at the party, probably a guy who hung around him and Anka. Fred had real luck that time, with Anka around him.

Today's been calm. The weather is staggering hot, and I can't wait to get in the water. We're off to the same little lake we went to a couple of days ago, Gömmaren.

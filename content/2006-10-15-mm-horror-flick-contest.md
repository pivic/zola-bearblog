[Here](http://www.mms.com/us/dark/index.jsp)'s a clever contest for the person who likes horror flicks. Almost every image has something to do with a horror film, so click and type the name of it.

Mikaela and I figured out 36 together (spending 45 minutes with it) before checking out [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/25187369@N00/249671583) cheat-sheet. How many did you figure out before packing it in, and which ones drove you the most nuts?

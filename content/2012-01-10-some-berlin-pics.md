The street outside the apartment.

Sehr Berlinesque!

The two above pics are from the atrocious place called "Monte Cristo". Well, I'm [a man awaiting revenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo)! They made a most atrocious so-called tiramisu which was nothing more than tinted ice with some remnants of chocolate and _something_ that I hope was baked...it could have been a cracker base. I **wish** it was. Their pizza was the most salty thing ever.

"Kater" is a word that means "male cat" or "hangover".

Aw! The photo-booth we used last time around was Defekt! this time.

I'm probably the only one in the world to think this was funny.

German graffito.

An evangelical school! I don't think I've seen such a place...ever. Perhaps except for Oklahoma.

This is the best vegetarian restaurant I've ever eaten at.

Hidden away close to the Cookies nightclub, there's [Cookies Cream](http://cookiescream.com), a very nice restaurant where the staff is courteous and English-speaking, where every single dish seems amazing. There's an open kitchen. There are apertifs and brilliant, sparkling riesling. Wonderful main dish...god. I die at the mere thought.

Next time...again.

Just outside the entrance of Cookies Cream. Now there's a duo you can't ignore: the warehouse storage space and a big chandelier.

The baggage drop at Arlanda airport, late in the evening. Awwww. Home.

Mikaela's taken more to liking yoga of recent. She has liked it since years back, but now she's more into it, Ashtanga Yoga, to be more precise, a quite physical version of yoga, about which you can read more [here](http://www.ashtanga.com).

She's taken a custom to playing Aphex Twin's ambient collections ("[Selected Ambient Works 85-92](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:t1arqjoyoj0a)", and "[Selected Ambient Works, vol. 2](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:au2gtq4zbu48)") while doing yoga, if she's not doing it to one of her DVD's or VHS tapes where an instructor goes through different excercises. I gave Mikaela [this tape](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000A2ZOK/ref=pd_wt_2/002-3038365-3379200?coliid=I1QADXVVGGU3D) as a present, and she likes it very much. Anyway, Mikaela's going to join a introductory yoga course in March!

I feel yoga is interesting, due to the fact that it's very soothing while quite physically demanding. It's probably, as Mikaela told me, a quite nice way for stressed people to calm down while doing something of worth, i.e. not watching reality shows on TV or something like that. One of the myths surrounding yoga might be that it's obligatory to feel or be spiritual to perform it; it's of course not. Try yoga, I say! It's much more work than I thought.

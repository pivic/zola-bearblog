Well, a couple of days ago Rade came over and we played NBA Live 2005 till our fingers bled. Or at least till we entered the playoffs and beat the Memphis Grizzlies in the third game, very nice. Rade ruled the world with Steve Nash, what can you say? And speaking of basketball, in real life Mr. Jermaine O'Neal made 55 points in one game, not bad at all for a little guy having been shut off from playing for a load of games, and suddenly, Indiana can't lose. Again. Go, Pacers!

Speaking of the NBA, they've put together [a little picture archive](http://www.nba.com/features/mask_photos_050103.html) of people who have wore face masks. Lebron James - could his recent basketball fortunes actually be because Rip Hamilton wore a face mask part of last season? Probably not, but it's an omen anyway. Har har.

Soon [Landet](http://www.landet.nu) will open. This is a new restaurant, club and live-stage that aims to cater traditional Swedish home cooking, besides French and south-European ones to boot. Sounds very nice, and I sincerely hope it will turn into something fresh and good, as we need that to happen here as well, out in the suburb. It's merely a few subway-stations away from our home.

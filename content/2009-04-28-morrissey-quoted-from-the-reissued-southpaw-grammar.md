Morrissey makes mistakes too:

> For the sleeve of Southpaw I repeated my World of Morrissey gaffe by gluing together very unappealing artwork - the use of other people's faces relieved me from staring back at my own. But it didn't work, and drabness reproached me from the HMV racks, with no one to blame but myself. Reprise had originally refused to use the photograph, and to my cost I had argued them down ... when sometimes ... you should just ... let go ... a _little_.

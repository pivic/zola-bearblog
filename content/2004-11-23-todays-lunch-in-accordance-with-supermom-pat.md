[Here's a picture](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-23-lunch.jpg) of today's porridge. That's right, I stayed at home today as well, as my stomach started acting strange again. Since [Supermom Pat told me](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=374#comment-214) I shouldn't add apples as they aren't good for the stomach, I added crushed sweet almonds some sliced nectarines. I feel a lot better now, so I'll be heading to work tomorrow.

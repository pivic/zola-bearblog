I've just come back from driving around the city, which was perilous! Absolutely ghastly at first, as I tried to careen a car that I haven't touched for more than six months out from a twirling garage...Bog. Mercy. I managed! I asked a colleague to tag along in order for me to be able to have the slightest chance to overcome my initial fear of trying to find the right route, answer phone-calls and obey the laws and kill no-one at the same time. Usually, I manage everything but the killing.

We skirted along the back-streets of southern Stockholm city as my faux-GPS ((The latest version of Google Maps on my mobile phone.)) told me to go north, which was absolutely wrong. Eventually, to the tune of Viktor playing System Of A Down as loudly as possible, we found a way and I parked spot on a zebra-crossing. Nice going, Red Baron me!

Further on south, we listened to Kaisers Orchestra, The Von Bondies and by the time we heard James' "Laid", Viktor freaked out and exclaimed the excellence of the lyrics as I tried to concentrate on the road, pedestrians - especially the legia of kids now enjoying their week off from school by bopping straight into the middle of the freaking road - and maniac disobedients who drove like wankers, in order to get us back to work in one piece. Worked beautifully. I must say, playing music that loud really helped.

I've also discovered a fancy for filming people as they think they're getting photographed. Call me merciless, but can you beat this?

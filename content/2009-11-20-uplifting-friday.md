As I'm completely drained because of sleep deprivation, I'm trying to get lift up by coffee and music. Come with me.

**E.L.O.** - "_[Livin' Thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livin%27_Thing "Livin' Thing")_"

Sure, [Jeff Lynne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Lynne "Jeff Lynne")'s hairy qualities and Ray-Bans immediately make you shy away from your screen but this song is magic so bear with it and repeatedly listen.

> Making believe this is what you've conceived From your worst day, I'm takin a dive Oh moving in line when you look back in time To the first day, I'm taken I'm taken
> 
> And you and your sweet desire, you took me ohh, higher and higher baby It's a living thing, It's a terrible thing to lose, It's a given thing What a terrible thing to lose
> 
> I'm takin a dive. Off the stage. Hey!

**Journey** - "_[Don't Stop Believin'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Stop_Believing "Don't Stop Believing")_" ((Home-made videos _rock_.))

Yep, I'm in [Americana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana "Americana") MOR mode this morning, but this is great stuff! People who love [The Sopranos](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141842/ "The Sopranos") keep telling me about how this song is in the final episode of the entire series but I don't care, this is just another kind of song that makes me want to punch the air and run up stairs like Rocky until I realise nobody's watching.

**[The Libertines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Libertines "The Libertines")** - "_Can't Stand Me Now_"

Shitty video that's just mashed together by their record company, but the song is absolutely brilliant and I could go on about the lyrics forever:

> An ending fitting for the start You twist and tore our love apart Your light fingers threw the dart Shattered the lamp into darkness it cast us...
> 
> No, you've got it the wrong way round Just shut me up and blamed it on the brown Cornered the boy kicked out at the world, The world kicked back a lot fuckin' harder...
> 
> If you wanna try, If you wanna try There's no worse you could do (oh oh oh) I know you lie, I know you lie I'm still in love with you (oh oh oh)
> 
> Can't take me anywhere (I'll take you anywhere) You can't take me anywhere (I can't take you anywhere) I'll take you anywhere you wanna go!
> 
> Oh, you can't stand me now (No, you can't stand me now) You can't stand me now (Oh, you can't stand me now) You can't stand me now (No, you can't stand me now) You can't stand me now, You can't stand me now!

**Elliott Smith** - "_Angeles/Coming Up Roses_"

I was tipped about this live medley [through Everybody Cares, Everybody Understands](http://eceu.tumblr.com/post/250496991/angeles-coming-up-roses-elliott-smith-live). Absolutely lovely and a great contrast to all the uptempo stuff here.

There you go, four vids to get your arse off the chair and into wakey-wakey mode; now please recommend me a song or three that make you put some pep in your step in the morning.

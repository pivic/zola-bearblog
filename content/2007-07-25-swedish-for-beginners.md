I just had the most singular start of a conversation with a user at work. This is what happened when I answered the support-tech phone:

> Niklas: Hello, IT Department, Niklas speaking. User: Hello! I'd like...I'd like...I'd like.
> 
> \[notable pause\]
> 
> N: Hello? U: Yes, I'd like...er...to have a program installed! N: Well, I'd-- U: A program installed, one that's...yes. N: I understand, you would like a program installed. With whom am I speaking, please? U: I...I'd like a program installed.

After this rite of passage, things went remarkably smooth; I just think the user hit an initial speed-bump before starting to think.

It reminded me of the following clip which is taken from "[Top Secret](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088286)", an 80's gem with a lot of good/bad humor. The scene shows [Peter Cushing](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001088) (!) playing "Sven JÃ¶rgensen", a Swede who runs a Swedish bookstore. Check it out.

I must admit I love this film. My mom and I once watched it and laughed so hard we almost peed in our pants. You've got to be in the right mood when watching this film, i.e. expecting bad jokes and it turns good; some examples of dialogue from the film are found [here](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088286/quotes).

**edit**: somebody has made a 10-minute-clip gathering a lot of funny scenes from the film, available [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92R20ImGNCU).

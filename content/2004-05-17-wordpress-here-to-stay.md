I've made up my mind.

I'm going with WordPress as my blogging system. In a few hours https://niklasblog.com will bounce to https://niklasblog.com, i.e. this blog. I've already converted my old posts from Blogger to WordPress, and that was easy.

The reasons for this switch are many, but here are the main "two":

- WordPress is fast and full of features. It allows a calendar, a search engine, categories, easy uploads, plugins, blogrolls, password-protected posts, et.c.
- Blogger is very dependent on the FTP system. It was also generally slow, didn't support any of the pro's mentioned above about WordPress, was quite hard to configure if you wanted to add something special (like the what-am-I-reading-now part of my blog, in the right column), especially after "Blogger reloaded".

I am a HTML newbie. In the world of web coding, I'm the equivalent of a tourist trying to find her way in Paris, using a translator computer, speaking in English. Hence, the easiness was an important part in my choosing the right blogging system.

WordPress suffers from a lack of support for newbies. Most of the people who hack their own blogs, do so masterfully (at least, compared with me, and this is no overstatement). They add their own scripts, database support, shoutboxes, format the blog very nicely, et.c. I have NO clue on how to do these things. Of course, one cannot expect to learn a language on the web right out of the box, but I am very computer literate, and mostly I see instructions that are a lot more specific, even on the web.

But I'm really not complaining. WordPress contains a LOT of good functions, and one does not have to be a magician to solve eventual problems. Everything in the package is very self-explanatory, and there are always the forums to consult.

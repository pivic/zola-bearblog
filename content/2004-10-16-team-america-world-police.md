Yesterday, Rade and I saw "[Team America: World Police](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372588)", the latest film from [Trey Parker](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005295) and [Matt Stone](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001778), the creators of [South Park](http://www.southparkx.net).

Approximately five minutes into the film I laughed so hard tears ran down my cheeks. Not those cheeks. Anyway, it's an extremely successful film. Check out the trailer [here](http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/team_america/large.html).

![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-26-peewater.jpg)Yesterday Mikaela arranged and served nice, Spanish foods, i.e. the ones we brought back. Well, some of it, anyway! Sausage, ham and cheeses were the order. I loved every bit of it, and it was blissful. The ham is dry and offers good chew-resistance. The sausage is also dry, and stored long enough to be carrying mold upon its surface; it is spicy and lends a slight taste of oil and garlic. The cheeses are great: one is a smooth manchego, and the other's a very ripe cheese. Mmm.

Things weren't as blissful with the water, though. As there are renovations afoot in our house, I noted that might have had something to do with our drinking-water turning into a brownish yellow. I telephoned one of the guys responsible, who confirmed our suspicions: one of the pipes had broken off and sprung a leak, hence forcing rust and other treats through the pipes into our glasses. Well, shit does happen! It only went on for a little while.

I tried out my new shoes today. Mikaela had given them a little impregnating treatment for suede shoes, so I'll be wearing them tomorrow, should it not rain or snow. Today the weather's been good, yet too cold to be sitting out-doors. A lot of restaurants in Stockholm are very keen on starting their out-doors-serving as soon as possible, and several already have. Today I spoke with a friend who works for the department that issues permits for the serving of alcohol, for Stockholm. He says they've got more than they can carry, and I don't doubt him for a minute. Sometimes he speaks of working 07:00-21:00, which is just too much. I fear he's burning out without realising it, which is why I take the subject up with him every chance I get. I feel I have to speak with him more seriously on the matter.

Now it's time to go to bed. Check out the pictures of most of the above events [here](http://www.niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-04-26). I created this new flashy picture gallery using [Adobe Photoshop CS2](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html), which is soon out. What do you think of it? Prefer the old galleries?

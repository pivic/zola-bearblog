Here's another themeless yet varied blend of soul for ya earhole! The mix is available [here](http://pivic.muxtape.com) as usual, and here's the breakdown:

1\. **Carter Burwell** - "Fargo, North Dakota"

The lead theme for "Fargo", the Coen brothers' masterpiece. This extraordinary leitmotif makes a brilliant companion and soundtrack for the snowy widths that carried murder. I've got to re-watch this film soon.

2\. **The Wiseguys** - "The Sound You Hear"

Theo Keating, the man behind [this band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiseguys), went out of his way to bring big beat to the masses when he first released "Executive Suite", but the album that really caught me was "The Antidote", which I've actually bought thrice, due to two thefts. By the way, Keating is now in the duo [The Black Ghosts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Ghosts), due to release their debut album on 2008-07-08. You'll find more commercial tracks by The Wiseguys right here.

3\. **Blur** - "To The End"

_Jusqu'à  la fin/En plein soleil_

I loved this track when in upper secondary school, and I love it now. Seeing Blur perform it live with the lights out, par a gigantic disco-ball, Là¦titia Sadier on backing vocals...lovely.

4\. **Covenant** - "Figurehead"

One of the most underestimated and unknown albums of the 90's, is Swedish electronic group Covenant's "[Sequencer](http://www.discogs.com/release/256707)". They were (as far as I know) the first to mix breakbeats with EBM in a really successful way, and their album is filled with brilliant tracks, notably "_[Stalker](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MsCyEW6Vyo)_".

5\. **Brian Eno** - "Needle In The Camel's Eye"

Once Eno left Roxy Music, his first solo album, "Here Come The Warm Jets", was released to great acclaim. The first time I heard it, was in the film "[Velvet Goldmine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120879)", where it was brilliantly placed. This is bombardment, something that probably affected Kevin Shields and hopefully gave Eno the money needed to go on and become what he is today.

6\. **Natacha Atlas** - "Oully"

Ranging from doing vocals for [Transglobal Underground](http://www.t-g-u.com) to making Egyptian tracks like this one, [Natacha Atlas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natacha_Atlas) sports her phenomenal voice with more emotion than technique - the latter being supreme. She's also sung a phenomenal cover of the James Bond classic "From Russia With Love", that I urge you to seek out.

7\. **Queen** - "Don't Stop Me Now"

A thorough feel-good track by Queen at their best, apart from a few tracks released during their later period. Freddie Mercury is still one of the best pop-singers ever.

8\. **Einstürzende Neubauten** - "12305(te Nacht)"

A sharp turn from the former track, the basis for this track is Blixa Bargeld's (founding member of Einstürzende Neubauten) feverish realisation of being 33,7 years old, standing in a hotel shower. I love the last paragraph of the lyrics, by the way found [here](http://www.lyrics007.com/Einstuerzende%20Neubauten%20Lyrics/12305%20(te%20Nacht)%20Lyrics.html), including English translation at the end.

9\. **Graham Coxon** - "People Of The Earth"

I bought this album second-hand yesterday for a pittance of what it's worth, almost feeling guilty in the process. The album's "[Happiness In Magazines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness_in_Magazines)", produced by Stephen Street, entirely written by Coxon and almost entirely played by himself. Very impressive, considering the high quality of the tracks. This one's about aliens looking down on the human race, stating we "don't even have a decent band"; this was released about right after Coxon left Blur.

10\. **Holly Golightly** - "Walk A Mile"

Cocky rock 'n' roll to sway to, this is a live version of a great track. I love it when English people manage to sound American in a great sense.

11\. **Immortal Technique** - "Mistakes"

This is one of the most swinging tracks off [Immortal Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Coronel)'s brand-new, often put off album called "The 3rd World". Political and great thinking - albeit anti-feministic and homophobic - get more of his Chomskyesque stuff [here](http://www.myspace.com/immortaltechnique).

12\. **Alec Empire** - "Suicide"

Almost more political than the above rapper, [Alec Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Empire) has been running anarchy from computers for a long time; he first hit me through his band [Atari Teenage Riot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Teenage_Riot). This is one of his solo efforts, off the album "[The Destroyer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Destroyer_(album))". I love these murderous breakbeats.

Songs and people, songs and people and love and friends and a drunken Zak shouting for NWA while celebrating his birthday! Erika turned up unexpectedly which was loadsafun, Maylin of course showed up and was pumped to hear some from the leaked Lady GaGa album, I hollered at a few of Zak's old friends whom I'd met before such as Petta and Andy and had a blast playing a lot of weird and lovely tracks. Alexander and Per turned up and I played one of [their](http://myspace.com/sailorandi) tracks. As it was a Monday people trickled away gradually until only X and I were left together with a few daring people who danced and actually graciously asked if we had any Broder Daniel. Of-hella-course! We played that and they went berzerk. It was great to meet our beloved friends and have a little talk.

At home a bit after two am, and while we were sleeping [X's mobile phone was carefully placed in a bowl of water](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2009/11/17/important-message-dont-call-or-txt-me) by one (or both) of our loving felines. So it's been drying off for a few days now and is feeling exceptionally better, even though I think it's still got a little water left in the display. Freaking electronics. Freaking cats! On the other hand, one cannot blame them but only try to hide stuff from them.

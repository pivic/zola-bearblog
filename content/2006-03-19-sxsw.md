If you have been living under a musical rock, you might not have noticed the top of it.

[SXSW](http://sxsw.com), founded 20 years ago, is a conference on music and media, really for people in these trades. A lot of them have of course used this moment to pig out and see a lot of artists play live, whilst now both music-lovers and geeks rise to the occation - to pig out and see a lot of artists perform live. If you think rock 'n' roll is utterly gay due to the nature of the scene, wait until you see a room full of 15-35-year-old male geeks hunched over their laptops, salivating over code presented at the front. I should know.

I'm a bit of both, actually, music and tech. Not code-prone, I do love tech that can help me (and some others) do something really useful with it. The days when I used to delve into code just to see if I could make something go bbzzzzkrnnk just for the geekery of it, are thankfully gone.

At the music conference-part of SXSW, artists such as Morrissey, Beastie Boys, Ray Davies, Dirty Pretty Things, Chamillionaire, Arctic Monkeys and [about 1300 more](http://2006.sxsw.com/music/showcases), play their music, films and give public interviews. Circa 700 of them have MP3's available through the site, so if you're pining for new music, check that out. There's also a streaming music-player available through [this page](http://2006.sxsw.com/music). Phwoarr, as if Pandora isn't enough.

Anyway, it's nice to see that one of my favourite magazines (both printed and online), [The Fader](http://www.thefader.com), has been covering SXSW a lot. I like the way they combine quite a lot of pictures with few words during the conference, as in [this example](http://www.thefader.com/blog/articles/2006/03/18/back-at-the-ranch).

The Swedish daily paper [Dagens Nyheter](http://dn.se) offer [this slide-show](http://www.dn.se/DNet/road/Classic/article/47/jsp/bildspel.jsp?a=530025&d=2198) from SXSW where Swedish artists are focused on.

Some day I'll be there.

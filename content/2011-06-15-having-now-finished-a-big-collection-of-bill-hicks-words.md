...and afterwards joking, strongly and harshly reminds me of what silly shit I did just after I bought my (so far _only_) electric guitar long ago. I played Jimi Hendrix' "_Live at Woodstock_" on video.

If I could have set my guitar on fire right after having seen that vid I would have. Not for the same reasons Jimi had, I'm quite sure.

I think what saved the guitar from getting sold was the fact that I came to realise how much my playing annoyed the hell out of my parents. Not to mention how my sister reacted. Not like you'd think, though.

I started playing with a band. The kind of band that made excuses for itself all of the time, took weeks to come up with a band name and played _one_ gig in its lifetime. Imagine the band Ash without originality, but with a female drummer who wrote all of the original tracks.

One day, I off-the-cuff-invited my sis to one of our rehearsals.

"I'm guessing you'll suck more than the other members."

I swear, if she could have turned her vitriol into TV-show scripts, she'd be a millionaire right now. She's still one of the sharpest people I've ever met. Enough yakking about her _nice_ qualities.

Two days passed. Rehearsal was coming up.

"I'm coming. Can I bring a friend?"

Two sentences passed between us without cursing, _and_ she wanted to hear me play the guitar? No way! I felt (and still do everytime I repeat this) like Keanu Reeves in a Bill and Ted film.

My sister sat with her friend in a corner of the rehearsal room that reeked of sweat (not _my_ band's) and no oxygen, and she smiled. A _sweet_ smile. And clapped in-between songs, shooting looks with her friend throughout, sniggering.

"You can really _play_, she said, on the way home."

Yeah, that's probably what saved me from selling my electric guitar in the end.

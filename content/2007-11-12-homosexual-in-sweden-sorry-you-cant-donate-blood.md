Yes, it's true. A homosexual person isn't allowed to donate blood if he/she lives in Sweden. The Swedish state doesn't allow it, seemingly because homosexuals carry on their lives differently than heterosexuals. **What?** How? Are we living in the dark ages? Is this some arcane rule that simply lives on and hasn't been squashed yet? It was actually made up in the 1980s, according to [this article](http://www.nt.se/ostergotland/artikel.aspx?articleid=2086048) (in Swedish), where homosexuals are labeled as a "risk group".

X has already posted about this [here](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2007/11/09/lets-discriminate) in a great way, so I'll let her do the talking as I would otherwise merely be regurgitating her words, yet not as eloquently.

**edit**: I've just e-mailed Maria Larsson, the Swedish Minister of...Health? ((In Swedish, she's à„ldre- och folkhälsominister.)) and I'll make sure to publish every reply here.

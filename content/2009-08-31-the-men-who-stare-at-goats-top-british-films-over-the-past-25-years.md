Finally, the trailer for the film "_[The Men Who Stare At Goats](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1234548/)_" is out:

It's based upon a book carrying the same name by [Jon Ronson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon%20Ronson), and the synopsis is explained by yours truly right [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1780).

Even though [George Clooney](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000123/ "George Clooney") is very much involved with the project, it seems that the trailer portrays the film as funny rather than horrid-by-humor, as the book undoubtedly made me feel. Still, a trailer may only be used to lure people into thinking that it's funny. Reminds me of this fan-made trailer that turns "[The Shining](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkVWuP_sO0)" into comedy. Anyway, it feels weird to see Jeff Bridges play what seems to be [The Dude](http://11.media.tumblr.com/QFlX6LQ2zl9pjm0nSSNy4lFgo1_400.jpg) again.

On the matter of film, The Observer Film Quarterly has recently compiled a list of what they believe are [**the best British films of the last 25 years**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/gallery/2009/aug/30/best-british-films-25-years). I think it's nice with a quite recent list instead of having old kitchen-sinks in there; no offense, but some times it's quite refreshing to shed the old skin, as it were. Here's the list:

25\. [The English Patient](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116209/ "The English Patient (film)") 24. [24 Hour Party People](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274309) 23. [My Summer Of Love](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382189) 22. [Man On Wire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155592/ "Man on Wire") 21. [Riff-Raff](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100491/ "Riff-Raff") 20. [Red Road](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0471030/ "Red Road (film)") 19. [Dead Man's Shoes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419677) 18. [Shaun Of The Dead](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748) 17. [This Is England](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480025) 16. [Hunger](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0986233) 15. [Under The Skin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124185) 14. [Naked](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107653) 13. [Control](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421082) 12. [Hope and Glory](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093209) 11. [Touching The Void](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379557/ "Touching the Void (film)") 10. [Four Weddings and a Funeral](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109831) 9. [Slumdog Millionaire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/ "Slumdog Millionaire") 8. [Ratcatcher](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171685) 7. [Sexy Beast](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203119) 6. [Nil By Mouth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119792) 5. [My Beautiful Laundrette](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091578/ "My Beautiful Laundrette") 4. [Distant Voices, Still Lives](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095037) 3. [Secrets & Lies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117589) 2. [Withnail & I](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094336) 1. [Trainspotting](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951)

Personally, I think "24 Hour Party People" and "Control" should have been way higher, but still, a nice list with a few bits in there that I should add to my list of must-sees!

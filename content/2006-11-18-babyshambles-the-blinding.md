Thanks to [Björg](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/128284232), here's the new video for Babyshambles' "The Blinding", the single off their coming EP with the same name. And if you don't purchase that EP, you're a right mess as it's _brilliant_. As dear [Frederic](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/295220575) has stated, Pete Doherty is responsible for some of the very best music this year, and hearing his music both in the shape of acoustic demos and live cuts to end up in the state they are on the EP is...brilliant. Anybody slagging the man for being out of touch hasn't got a fucking chance when it comes to music. Just listen to [the lyrics off "I Love You But You're Green"](http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/I-Love-You-But-You're-Green-lyrics-Babyshambles/EACE1D20D01D1582482570AC000B04C9) and see if you can find any pop track that matches "I Wish". Said EP is out on the 4th of December.

The video is directed by [Julien Temple](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0854697).

This morning I woke up with a terrible throat-ache, which subsided after leaving for work. I had a tea and then left. While at work, I started freezing, feeling dizzy, caught a severe head-ache and spewed twice, right after lunch. My throat, of course, burned even more due to this, so all in all I went home. My muscles started aching almost instantly on the way home. When home, I swept myself up in a blanket, made herbal tea which I mixed with honey and played [Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition](http://www.rockstargames.com/midnightclub3), which helped calm me, weirdly enough. It's a driving game where the player should 1) drive like hell and beat one's opponents and 2) buy a lot of stuff for your car to make it look as nice as possible. A Barbie game for boys! After playing for an hour I had to just lie down, game off. Ooh. The world twirled, and my throat was killing me.

Mikaela came home a few hours later, groceries in hand. She felt bad a couple of days ago, and we fear we've gotten it through Sebastian, one of Mikaela's brothers, while in Madrid. Contagious bloody disease!

Mikaela and I made dinner, or rather, I helped out in which-ever way I could, preparing the dish Mikaela had compiled: a bulgur and salmon salad. The bulgur was of course boiled, and then stir-fried a short while, together with olive oil, garlic, stock and mint. The salmon was fresh and smelled good. A salad was made, comprised of paprika, leek, onion, peeled carrots (you'll see, far tastier than chopped carrots, methinks) and lettuce.

Check [these pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-04-27) out of the dinner. Very nice indeed.

There's even a slide-show feature, available if you click the play-button in the south-east part of the screen.

Now for more tea, adià³s!

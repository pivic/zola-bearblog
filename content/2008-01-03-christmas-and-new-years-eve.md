This Christmas was celebrated in Flen, where X's family is from. It was massive. Presents, kids and half-drunk grown-ups, just like a regular Christmas Eve; as my parents are from (former) Yugoslavia and Finland, I don't have any other relatives in Sweden, other than my grandmother on my mom's side, so celebrating with a big family isn't exactly something I'm used to. It was definitely fun - and _loud_! Loads of food - even veggie - and lots of drink was consumed. Desserts. More desserts. People chatted merrily away. X and I escaped to the comfort of her old room when the volume rose above [Manowar-level](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudest_band_in_the_world) and returned as things had calmed down some. As Santa had visited, presents were unwrapped and the kids' sugar-levels were lowered in tact with the whisky-intake of the grown-ups going up, the volume was gradually lowered. We played _[Fame Game](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/16681)_, a board game that allowed me first to lose and then win, while some other non-mentioned fellow gamers bickered on the importance of stuff like, for instance, pronouncing the acronym "YSL" correctly...those of us who were sober had a clear advantage; need it be said?

Here's a little film of Tyra, who is X's little cousin from Gothenburg. It's filmed on Christmas Eve at X's grandparents' place. She's sugared-up and obviously loving the effect her socks have on the polished floor.

    

After spending Christmas in Flen, we went home to Bagarmossen where we crashed and had a lovely time; my parents came by and had coffee and buns with us which was nice, but otherwise it was all X and I. Mmm. Calm. Here's a dark little film showing what went down a couple of minutes into 2008. Happy New Year to you all!

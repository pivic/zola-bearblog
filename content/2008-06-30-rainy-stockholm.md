As I found myself rained-in at Tvålpalatset, there was fuck all to do but film what seemed to be the end of the world - at least if you ask me, a Western Civilisation-type of brat - and wish the rain would have the decency to subside before I really, _really_ had to go to work; lunch-time squandered, I ran to work as quick as I could and dearly wished I'd dragged my umbrella with me to work, just for once. Bah.

Funny bit: the orange Smart-car to the right smashed into the bumper of the car to the left. Twice. A stranger and I stood at the entrance of Tvålpalatset and laughed at the awful/intoxicated driver.

My vacation starts on Saturday, thank Bog.

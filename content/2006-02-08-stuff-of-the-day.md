What's a mash-up? It's a matter of combining two or more songs (preferably by different artists) to make a new one. [Best of Bootie 2005](http://www.bootiesf.com/bestofbootie_2005) offers a complete mash-up CD to all of us! There's even a cover in there. Glee!

Writing on music, [here](http://zdnet.com.com/1606-2_2-6036354.html)'s another revelation, for all us guitar-playing people: it's a video of a guy at DEMO 06 playing a guitar that's plugged into a computer with just a USB-cable. Using a program called Sibelius, his playing is translated into a score! Bejesus. I was tipped about [Tronical](http://www.tronical.com/info01.html) at the same time, which reminded me of an earlier gadget I've tipped you about [before](http://news.com.com/2300-11398_3-6001452-1.html).

[![Tussan in the house!](http://static.flickr.com/30/50916626_f6f34a3b79_m.jpg)](http://static.flickr.com/30/50916626_f6f34a3b79.jpg "Tussan!")Maybe you've heard about [lightbox](http://particletree.com/features/lightbox-gone-wild). No? Then just click the picture and you'll see the buzz. All possible thanks to my new [WordPress lightbox plugin](http://zeo.unic.net.my/2006/01/17/wp-lightbox-js-wordpress-plugin) that I'll no doubt use about two times more, during my life-time.

Writing a lot of e-mail? Check [this very valuable article](http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb06/egos.html) from APA. It should be compulsive reading for everybody.

Oh, [Belle and Sebastian](http://www.belleandsebastian.com)'s new album, "[The Life Pursuit](http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/belleandsebastian/lifepursuit)", drops today. I hope I'll receive my ltd. ed. version (CD+DVD) soon. Speaking of music, Spike Lee rants [against Fiddy and Irv Gotti](http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/8289) and also [against Snoop](http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/8274), all in good taste. Just check this out, courtesy of Spike:

> You name your company Murder Incorporated, your logo's got bullet holes in it, you changed your name to Gotti, and you wonder why your ass is in court?

Don't forget to check [this forum thread](http://forums.studentdoctor.net/showthread.php?t=257985) containing advice from medical personnel. One of my fave quotes:

> Never, ever leave flashlights, shampoo bottles, beer bottles or any long, circular object on the floor because someday you will fall on it and it will somehow, work its way up your rectum.

As some people believe more in unseen, omnipotent sensations and writings surrounding those ((Collectively known as _religion_ or _hocus-pocus_.)) than in scientific evidence, I am not very surprised that masses of people in Colombia have fallen victim to a pyramid investment scam that spanned more than 66 offices in nine cities across the nation.

How can this be? Perhaps those affected would have been more careful, had the scammers used blatant company names, such as "Fast, Easy and Effective Money". The problem is, one of the companies involved _was actually named just that_. [According to The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/14/colombia-investment-scam-riots), one of the agencies managed to grab more than Â£110 million.

Besides of taking all the money they possibly fleece, some of the agencies left scathing notes on their office doors for people coming to get their money back:

> "Dear investors, thanks for trusting us and depositing your money," said a note on the door of a company in the province of Cauca. "Now, for being stupid and believing in financial witchcraft, you will have to work for your money." ((From [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/14/colombia-investment-scam-riots) from The Guardian.))

How did the scammed react? [By rioting]( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/nov/13/colombia-riots-savings). I understand it; wouldn't you riot if what you had believed in, an unseen thing that you were promised would save you, brought you extreme grief instead of salvation? If you would - please think of religions. Thank you.

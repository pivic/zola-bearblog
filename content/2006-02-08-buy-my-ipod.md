Hey, here's a little quasi-spamf for all you Swedes dying to buy a used iPod!

I'm flogging my old one for merely 1000SKR (or 1500SKR if you want it now) so [here](http://www.tradera.com/auction/auction.aspx?aid=24366945)'s the auction. Go get! Think about your granny or great-grandfather that _really_ needs one. Here's your chance to get exclusive rights on that will.

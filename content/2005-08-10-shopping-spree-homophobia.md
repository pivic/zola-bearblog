I've been buying stuff. I got a wad of money back from the Swedish state - and it even proved not to be a mistake on their behalf! So, I ordered [the printer I've been yakking about](http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/printers/bubble_jet/pixma_ip8500/index.asp), plus different types of paper for it.

While at Badlands the other day, I got myself "[The Nomi Song](http://www.thenomisong.com)", which turned out...not very well-made. I'm surprised it didn't turn out great, given the subject. Read all on Klaus Nomi here. His live performances seem to have been better than his records, anyway. And even though his appearence on Saturday Night Live with David Bowie turned legendary, Bowie dropped poor Klaus like a pile of bricks slightly afterwards, despite promises of future collaborations. I believe that was during one of Bowie's cocaine-periods, anyway.

I also got hold of Depeche Mode's, or rather - [D.A. Pennebaker](http://phfilms.com)'s synthesised road-movie, "[101](http://101dvd.depechemode.com)". It's great, with a lot of good behind-the-scenes footage which shows why Pennebaker's such a great live-music-director. I love the scenes with the fans who won the chance to tour around and catch every Depeche Mode-gig in Northern America. And hey, the songs are great as well.

Oh, by no way, call me cynical but [I've always hated "Walking In Memphis"](http://www.nme.com/news/113292.htm).

Today DN has published [a tiny article](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=579&a=448585&previousRenderType=6) \[in Swedish\] on how come Uppsala Reggaefestival lets Capleton perform despite him being a homophobe. According to DN, the spokesperson for this festival, Yared Tekeste, says it's OK. Why? During February this year, a deal was struck with Capleton, where he signed a contract saying he wouldn't perform his "most homophobic songs". What bastards! "Our message is peace and understanding," Tekeste said to DN. I've just written them a little e-mail asking what they're on, and I'll post the reply here - should I receive one. I'll post the e-mail I sent to them as a comment to this article.

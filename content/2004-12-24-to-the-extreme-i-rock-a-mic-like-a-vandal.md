"Five gooold riiiings!" If you didn't get that one, get Eddie Izzard's "[Dress To Kill](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00003CWOU/102-3231582-9129714?v=glance)" immediately.

Yesterday, I got a package from \*K\*, who included some weird DVD's, a lovely assortment of teas, a very nice Hallmark card and a very peculiar fanzine, probably made by somebody I know. And her husband.

So check out some real yuletide pictures [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-12-24), taken during the morning. I must ask you to take extreme caution when watching the last picture as it may cause damage to your eye-sight permanently. And I'm dying because of the wound described graphically in it. So there. Thank you, I love you, good-bye. Soon we're off to my parents and then to Mikaela's. Rrah! It'll be lovely. I'm sure.

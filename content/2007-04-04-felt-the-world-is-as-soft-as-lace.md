![Lawrence](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-04-04-felt.jpg)The first time I heard [Felt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felt_(band)) was due to an accident. A nasty [My Bloody Valentine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_bloody_valentine)\-fan sent me a track saying it was MBV, but it really was Felt. He/She even tagged the MP3 so that for a couple of weeks I thought Felt were a bunch of naughty little thieves, culling poor Kevin Shields for everything he had. I had barely heard MBV at the time but their sound is easily recognised, so...

Having punished the nasty person ((Using _unkind words_!)), I later listened to the album "[The Splendour Of Fear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Splendour_of_Fear)" and was caught by the first two songs. The first was gloomy and had a great sound. Simple guitar with reverb, played nicely. The second track, "The World Is as Soft as Lace", was even more airy, lighter ((And might have spurred Robert Smith to pen "[Friday, I'm In Love](http://www.paradise-engineering.com/quotation/fridayiminlove.html)", come to think of it.)) adorned with great guitar-melodies and attractive singing; well, the singing _still_, after a bunch of listens later, doesn't sound in-place, which just makes it better.

I didn't know Felt was in effect a one-man-band until a couple of years later, when Cherry Red did everybody a favour by [reissuing all ten Felt-albums in 2003, remastered and dandy](http://www.cherryred.co.uk/cherryred/artists/felt.php). The main man's Lawrence Hayward, who led the band for appx. ten years before calling it quits.

There are a lot of artists that have been influenced by Felt, e.g. Belle & Sebastian, Vini Reilly ((Even though the man may just as well have influenced Hayward right back.)) and even Johnny Marr.

The last time I heard them was on the Belle & Sebastian DVD "[Fans Only](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403872)", where this very track was played during a black-and-white slo-mo film was played.

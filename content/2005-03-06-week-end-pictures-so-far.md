On Friday I snapped [a few pictures of my office](http://www.niklasblog.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=5). Kalle's visible, playing with his beard whenever bored. Beardy people, a special breed.

After that a few work-mates and I went to SÃ¶derhof, where we could have the pleasure of being served food where the french fries were glowing on the outside and completely raw on the inside (which _I_ didn't eat; half a year I vowed never to eat there again). Jesper, Peter and Anos met up, and while my work-mates ran home, we (sans Peter) went to Blond, the club where Jesper and I always head. There was a lesbian theme running, and quite few people were there. I managed to squabble with some goths over music, which was fun. Anos left early, Jesper and I too; I came home at appx. 00:00 having called dear \*K\* and accosted her with my drunkenness. [Here](http://www.niklasblog.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=7) are a few pictures from that incident.

The day after started quite drowsy, but as I'd actually drunk a lot of water before heading to bed, I wasn't as bad off as I expected to be. Frederic wanted to shop at town, so we went. We met Finn at [Kalori](http://www.kalori.se), the second place they've opened in Stockholm. Kalori is a franchise of food places directed at people who work out. Calorie notes are next to every meal on the menu, and the ones low on GI are high-lighted. Frederic and I went to Commes des Garcons, and they're special, alright. Some clothes were unique and very nice, while others were f-ing laughable. 2500SKR for a pair of MC Hammer pants with the tackiest patterns ever? That's enough. Frederic got himself a pair of Fred Perry shoes, quite happy about that. The CdG perfume smelled of musky incense, yet tangy enough to beat Old Spice on the old man's top three, Kouros firmly in third place. We then went to Pet Sounds, the best music shop in the whole south of Stockholm (probably in all of Stockholm, actually), where I found a reggae DVD for Marie's birthday (more on that soon), and then went to [Badlands](http://www.badlands.se), the new video/magazine/music place of the south part of town. It's small, but good. The walls are tiled with films, and even though you've got your Criterion discs, rare documentaries and even a gangsta rap colour book (!), I couldn't help but think that most of the films were 80-150SKR more expensive than those you can get through [Swedisc](http://www.swedisc.com). Pictures from the shopping at CdG are available [here](http://www.niklasblog.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=6).

In the evening, Marie held a birthday party in her own honor. Jesper had made a lot of food, including focaccia, very nice! Marie made punch, and as Stephan and I were the first there, we pressed ice-cubes out of plastic that made my hands go numb. We then proceeded to drink punch and laugh at Kali, the house cat; it's recently been castrated, so it has to wear the mandatory plastic funnel around its head. It reacted quite strangely at that, crawling around the floor like a shell-shocked war veteran. People started coming, and it's quite obvious that more and more people of my generation are having children. Two were at the party. One was clad in a plush leopard suit! Wonderful. I tested her grip reflex and the a-couple-of-months-old sure gripped hard. I smiled at her and she smiled back. Oooh. Pictures from the party are available [here](http://www.niklasblog.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=4).

People chatted along and drank. I left quite early and somehow my gloves were missing. Never mind, I came home in good time and woke early this morning. I've been into WordPress, the software that runs this blog, looking for new themes and nice plug-ins. I like the new theme, Quentin. The themes are, as always, available in the right-hand side of this blog.

Oh, I've got to mention this. DN has published [this article](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=597&a=387020&previousRenderType=2) (in Swedish, even though the pictures are in...the language of the eye) on "photo traps". I'm not sure of the term in English, yet it's the art of setting up a camera that is triggered by movement and heat due to infrared sensors. The meaning of this candid camera business is to snap pictures of animals that have very seldom, if ever, been caught on film. The Abbot Duiker has never been shot on film, which makes its appearence very special. The fact that it, on picture, nibbles a frog makes it extremely special! A carnivore! I think you know why I'm a sucker for The Discovery Channel. I love it. I could watch documentaries on ants dissecting camel dung for hours - _if_ the story's good: "Move that shit...move it! Move! Move the shit faster! More shit! Move it!"

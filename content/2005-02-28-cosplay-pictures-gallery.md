Generally, cosplay is a pest as I find 99,919831% of the people who love it to be morons with no idea that they look like shit, while dressed up as their favourite anime characters. That's what cosplay's about: dressing up as an anime character and role-playing as it. [Here](http://www.caofei.com/caofei/02%20VIDEOS/10%20Cosplayers/01.htm)'s a link to pictures of people who are well-dressed and the images are stunning. I'm not a farking fan, but when you come across rogue pictures of this kind of phenomena for the umpteenth time and they're _stunning_, you have to share them, despite the fact that people will now think I'm into this. Whateva!

Also, I'm trying out a gallery, which you can find [here](https://niklasblog.com/gallery). See what you make of it, do comment and tell me if it's twaddle or if you prefer it to [the old way](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-02-yum).

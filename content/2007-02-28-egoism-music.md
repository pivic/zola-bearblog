To stop myself from swamping the world with initiation rites, obligatory wedgies for not listening to my stuff 24/7, constantly pouring beer onto the ground to celebrate dead tracks, et.c., I've set up [this forum](https://niklasblog.com/forums/forum.php?id=1&page) for all announcements and discussion regarding my home-made music.

True, you could bypass that and just go to my last.fm-page, where I'll be posting [all my music](http://www.last.fm/music/Niklas+Pivic/Die+Kummin+Und+Die+Mandel), but you might not get the instant trivia that goes with this nerdy deal. And my forum has [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)), which last.fm still doesn't supply.

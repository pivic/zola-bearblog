![Lady GaGa](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-20-ladygaga.jpg)X and I went with The Pirate Cats to see Lady GaGa at Berns. Free as well! A couple of days ago I was ranting about how I wanted her to visit Stockholm and yesterday she did! Happy me! First X and I queued for 30 minutes to get into the venue, only to meet Tobit and Dagny five minutes after we'd entered; they'd queued for 30 seconds. Drat. X and I were extremely hungry and as no food (and no alcohol) was served at the venue before 20:00, we left and had a quick eat at Max, where some of us saw [Danny](http://danny.nu) who is a former Swedish Idol contestant; he was actually to warm up for Lady GaGa! Horrid thought. We quickly left Max because we didn't want the venue to fill up and us to be excluded, so we ended up standing around outside, freezing while eating our veggie stuffs.

The venue was packed with kids and the only beverages that were served was juice and pop. The four of us sat around and talked when a record label person started making rounds, giving away copies of the aforementioned Danny's new album. We all grabbed a copy each and laughed at him and his misspelling of the word schizophrenia in one of the tracks on the album.

The warm-ups started going, after a man came onstage, shouting the name of the sponsor and their products a bunch of times. The kids in the venue were quite cute and irritating as they screamed at the slightest thing, like twirling lights going on above their heads. Some dancers came on. Boring. A couple of Swedish rappers came on and made us so excited that we almost paid them attention; seriously, it was all tacky. Danny came on and made us laugh as he was dressed like a bad guy from a 90s b-movie: big, square black glasses, a jet black glittery hoodie and an impeccable dance, consisting of holding one arm next to the side of his body and the other outstretched, going up and down as if he was trying to be as cool as Kevin Federline. Gah!

After that, DJ Viet-Naam played "two more songs before Lady GaGa!" about four times, and then it went down. She came on wearing clothes designed by Christian Siriano and...you have to check her out videos out to get the look, for instance "[_Just Dance_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M65zI9LH-as)". She started off to "_Beautiful Dirty Rich_" wearing glasses with LCD-screens as eyes; she later donned a cane with a glowing cluster of white lights at the top. The choreography was fresh, I'd say especially during "_Paparazzi_"; the entire act made me think about how much style, clothes, dance and overall visuals play a part for some acts. She cared! Really cool. "_Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)_" was excellent, much as on record, especially as the vibe of the song is extremely summery and when GaGa said she was influenced by her "favourite pop group" which was Ace of Base! It's quite easy to spot the similarities between the crisp sound of "Eh Eh" as compared with AoB's seminal pop track "_[The Sign](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96jFtzVa80A)_". DJ Space Cowboy played her tunes and acted hype man, and the gig was over quite soon. A little showcase, really nice.

Here's an edited video that I shot, enjoy:

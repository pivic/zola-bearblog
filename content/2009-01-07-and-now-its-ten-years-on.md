![Yer phone](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2009-01-07-telephone.jpg)It's emergency phone time, and I'm answering calls from users.

User: Hello. _Application X_ doesn't work.

Now, **Application X** is a thing that allows a user to answer telephone calls through software; it's not IP telephony, but a system consisting of a hardware box that allows the user to connect two separate telephone lines to a computer by means of a software application. This system often malfunctions, and is extremely touchy as far as any type of change is concerned.

After a bit of troubleshooting, the user admits to having bought a brand new, never before used power adapter for the hardware box.

I: Prey tell, what is the voltage and current used by the power adapter? U: ...I can't see the point in telling you that. I: Well, if the voltage and/or current released by the power adapter differs from what the hardware box requires, it may be the reason to why the application malfunctions.

Insert five second pause here.

U: So, you mean to tell me that _Company X_, that we have been using to purchase electrical products for _the past 10 years_, are the source of the problem? I: Not really; I believe that if the voltage and/or current released by the new power adapter differs from what the hardware box requires, it may very well be the reason for why the application malfunctions. U: \[mutters\] It's the same voltage and current. I: Can you please try to use another electrical power adapter, one that you currently use and that you positively know works, in order to see if the new power adapter is the source of the problem? U: \[sighs, then:\] I'll call you back as I'm about to use the application again.

The user then hung up. Ten minutes later:

U: Hello. Now I've connected the new power adapter. ((When users call the emergency tech support phone and don't introduce themselves upon calling for the second or third time that very same day, they seem to either lack knowledge of the fact that I - assuming the role of tech support - have spoken with other persons during the time they and I hadn't, or...they are angry and passive aggressively want to vent. In this case, it was the latter, but I remembered this user's voice quite well so I didn't have to go through the roundabout of who?-me,wejustspoke-oh-youshouldknow.))

I cheerily exchanged salutations and remotely connected to the user's computer to see what was happening. I saw the software started and the user moving the mouse pointer over the button that, when pressed, dials a number.

U: Now, I've connected the old power adapter and will now click...this...button...to...make...you...see.

The user sounded eerily like [The Emperor from the Star Wars films](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpatine) during the last words which seemed infinitely prolonged! The pauses were probably very theatrical to the user, but I really had to force myself to suppress laughter. I almost expected a laser beam to pierce through the phone or/and screen to cut me in half as the user audibly clicked, when suddenly...everything...worked. A call was placed without any problem. A magnificent silence followed, during which I could hear the user swallow, perhaps pride mixed with saliva.

U: Now it works. I: Yes! Hence, I believe the problem lies in using the new power adapter. U: That...may be the problem. I'll call back if it reoccurs.

No call yet. Maybe it'll take ten years?

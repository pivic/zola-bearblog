Welly-well, [what once was](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7954447.stm)...

So, they're going on a world tour.

Yes, I will go to see them if they show up in Sweden. I've got my expectations set LOW. Usually, when your former heroes turn from

...I'm scared.

Of course, they're a jaded bunch and I'm certain they know it'd be a complete fiasco if they don't really shape up and face their former selves, reinvent and do greatness again.

And for their Swedish counterpart:

And to top things off, [whose reunion is more significant, The Stone Roses or Steps](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15333782)?

**Cred**: thanks to Muma for the two latter pics!

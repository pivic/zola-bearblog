If you've just downloaded [the Windows 8 Release Preview ISO](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/iso) using Google Chrome - don't.

Redo it, using IE.

I actually downloaded the image, didn't checksum the ISO (i.e. check it was a 100% copy of the one off the Microsoft site), hooked the ISO up to VirtualBox and got this:

> "No Device drivers were found. Make sure that the installation media contains the correct drivers, and then click OK."

I tried a multitude of solutions, but the only way was: download the ISO through IE.

**edit, 2012-08-16**:

Having used Chromium (i.e. Chrome in developer's edition) to download the Windows 8 RTM, there were no problems with the above.

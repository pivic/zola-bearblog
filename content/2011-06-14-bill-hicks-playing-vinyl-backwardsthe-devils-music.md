The below is verbatim from the book "_[Love All The People: Lyrics, Letters, Routines](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248090.Love_All_the_People)_", which I highly recommend; this is originally from one of his performances at the Vic Theatre, Chicago, USA, in November 1990, which was later released as an HBO video special in 1991, titelled "_[One Night Stand](http://www.documentarywire.com/bill-hicks-legendary-one-night-stand)_".

Remember this shit: if you play certain rock albums backwards there's satanic messages? Let me tell you something, if you're sitting 'round your house playing your albums backwards, you _are_ Satan. You needn't look any further. And don't go ruining my stereo to prove a fucking point either.

'Come here, come here, listen. (_makes snorting, growling noises_) Can you hear that? Listen.' 'Hey cut it out. That's brand new, man. What the fuck are you doing?" 'No, shut up. Listen, real close. (_growling_) Can you hear that? It's crystal clear. "Satan is lord, Satan is lord." It's like he is in the room.' (_makes growling noises again_) 'Oh my God, _you're_ Satan, Aargh!'

Satan! Ruiner of stereos, destroyer of needles! Because, listen, I've got an idea. It's time to make a bold admission, all right? Because for the last ten years we've seen the rise of conservatives and fundamentalists and other forms of (_takes deep gasp_) _fascism_, OK? Who try and tell us what to believe and what to think. I've got a bold admission if you're one of those people, are you ready for it? They say rock 'n' roll is the devil's music. Well, let's say that we know for a fact that rock 'n' roll _is_ the Devil's music. And we know that it is for sure, OK? At least he _fucking_ jams!

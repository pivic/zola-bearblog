Jon Stewart came to Bill O'Reilly's TV-show "O'Reilly Factor" again a couple of days ago, and it's funnier than funk.

Obviously, the two are very sharp objects, but Stewart doing a spider-impression in the middle of faux-political discourse is hilarious. And also:

> **Stewart**: You're a news organisation between nine and eleven, and then you're "opinions" between eleven and one, except on Jewish holidays...

I love the second part where O'Reilly defends the fact that FOX News (their label) nowadays separate "news" and "opinions" without labelling them once on the air.

> **O'Reilly**: you don't think people know the Factor is an opinion chair, you don't think they know that? **Stewart**: it's certainly not clearly labelled; I've looked at your promos - you're part of the "fair and balanced" part.

Also, [as quoted from The Hollywood Reporter](http://www.thrfeed.com/2010/02/jon-stewart-vs-bill-oreilly-video.html), but edited and corrected by me:

> In the second segment the duo debate whether Fox News is a "fair and balanced" news organization, with Stewart calling the network a "cyclonic perpetual emotion machine."
> 
> "You have become, in some ways, the voice of sanity here, which, as I said, is like being the thinnest kid at fat camp."

The part at 24:43 where O'Reilly feels like becoming a TV-preacher and Stewart laughs and goes "Oh God", might be the funniest thing. That, or the fact that streaming this pulp shows what FOX News is about; politics as entertainment. Too bad they're not trying to combine the funny with truth - do note the words at the top of this screenshot:

The end is just so simple and sweeps away the entire conversation, in a very metaphorical sense regarding FOX and, well, reality:

> **O'Reilly**: you're out of touch with the folks. **Stewart**: the folks?! You live in a _castle_!

No, this has not turned into a Babyshambles blog, but as I really like this single - see [this post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1313) for lyrics and more proof of that - you've got to get the cane as this is the spanking brand new video for the first single off their coming album, now appearing to be titelled "Shotter's Nation". ((Or "Shotters' Nation", depending which of the slightly dyslexic and utterly loveable Babyshamble you get word from.)) Enjoy!

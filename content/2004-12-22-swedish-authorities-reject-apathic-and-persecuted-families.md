DN posts [this article](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&a=358133&previousRenderType=2) about a family that tried to get political asylum in Sweden and stay here, but who were rejected. The family has been persecuted for long, treated like animals, with a daughter in who's clinically apathetic. Horrific, and this family is far from the only one being subjected to and treated this way. The Swedish authorities treated them like bastards. The foreign policies are so f-ed up.

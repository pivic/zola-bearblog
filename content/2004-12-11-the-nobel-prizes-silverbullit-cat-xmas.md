![Hoe!](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-12-11-victoria.gif)I really hate the Nobel prize ceremony. See? And you say I'm negative! Hah! When the royal family annually receives many million crowns, Sweden's supposedly a democracy and a monarchy. I say good riddance to bad trash, and utterly hope that they will die or perish quite soon. Everybody hates the royal family, right? Still, they're there. The picture displays Victoria, the crown princess, bigging up the ones who need the tax-payers' money to vacate in the alps, while our homeless die from starvation or the cold.

I've been listening to Silverbullit's "[Arclight](http://www.silverbullit.se/rec_arclight01.htm)" of recent. Rocky, reminiscent of The Soundtrack Of Our Lives, bringing a chunk of reverb and guitars, churning sound, and a singer who sounds a lot like the great, late [Ian Curtis](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:n8rv283c05na), the singer of Joy Division. It's quite good. The songs are quite different.

Don't forget to check out the "[A Cat's Christmas](http://www.fluffytails.ca/christmas.asp)", courtesy of Frederic.

[Here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4313869.stm) you can read a very interesting article on how come Mel Gibson didn't like being followed. Christ, Jesus did!

> A man accused of stalking actor Mel Gibson believed he was on a mission from God, a court has heard.

So why not? Remember the old quote: "If you talk to God, you are praying. If God talks to you, you are schizophrenic." -->Thomas Szasz

Today I received a confirmation letter from my parish, as I'm a registered Protestant Christian. Oops, sorry: I was. Said letter confirms that I have, from 2005-02-25, left the protestant church. I am no longer an official member of any religion. I feel good. I've been meaning to do this for so long. Before the Internet, one had to visit a local "church administrator" but I haven't gone, so when I spotted a "formal letter of resignation" on a colleague's desk a week ago, I quickly found out all one has to do to leave the Swedish church is to send a letter, stating the obvious, sporting one's squiggle to the head vicar at one's local parish and you're as right as rain! So now, no taxes.

I'm so out for the day, by the way. I have never spoken with this many users in one day. They completely bombarded the emergency phone with calls, and I understand them thoroughly. Both of the emergency phones ran out of batteries, and my throat's quite sore. I'm drinking coffee and I'm barely alive. I am, however, very glad for three things: one, Mikaela's at home. Two, I'm lying in our sofa, writing this. Lovely. Three, Crime Night is on tonight. Thank you, Discovery Channel. Please don't let the episodes be re-runs.

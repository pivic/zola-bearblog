I just suddenly felt like writing something.

It's been a while. [X](http://miapivic.tumblr.com) and [Marielle](http://llojura.blogspot.se) have sparked my will to write again, and yes, I've been off-kilter with reading blogs, Facebook and stuff like that. Work and free time has taken up everything for me. I haven't prioritised reading blogs. Or anything other than books, actually. I'm reading "_[Infinite Jest](https://niklasblog.com/?p=10722)_", finally. It reminds me of both X and Marielle's writing. Slightly stream-of-consciousness but very lucid.

But I'm back.

I _feel_ like I'm back.

And feeling and doing is good. Not keeping my eyes to a screen all the time, [like Jonathan Franzen spoke](http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/good-times-cover-stories/3907-jonathan-franzen.html) at Cowell college last year; that shit does you no favours. You won't remember checking Facebook any time, but you will remember a walk through a park, probably even some minute detail about it even if nothing seems to happen and you've gone down that road a thousand times before. That I prefer, rather to having people constantly parade me online.

I've met Bobby and Brian, Amanda and Malin in Stockholm; that was incredible (in the true sense of the word) and X and I have been to Brighton, England. I can't really put that into words yet. It's too big. I'm gonna take this slowly but still try to make this my return to writing stuff on my own little space.

Hello. Let's write and read soon.

Oh yeah by the way, the song above is from [The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion](http://thejonspencerbluesexplosion.com)'s new album, "**Meat + Bones**", which is _really_ good. I didn't know they had new stuff coming out. It's really fucking good. _The blues is still #1_.

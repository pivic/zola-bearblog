I just found a good, freeware piece of audio software, called [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net). Seems very nice!

[This is broken](http://thisisbroken.com), "A project to make businesses more aware of their customer experience, and how to fix it".

[Blogbinders](http://www.blogbinders.com) \[thanks, Staffan\], a site where you can have your blog turned into a book. It's not working very well as I'm testing it right now, though.

[You send it](http://yousendit.com): Instead of trying to e-mail large files to friends, use yousendit.com. Upload your file (up to one gigabyte), enter the recipient's e-mail address, and the site will send a message with a link to download it. Files expire after seven days so you never have to delete them.

[Tom Waits lists his 20 most cherished albums ever](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,13887,1439272,00.html), which is a fair collection indeed! [Bill Hicks](http://www.billhicks.com)! [Zappa](http://zappa.com)! I was inspired and am now listening to The Pogues' "[Rum, Sodomy & The Lash](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006957S0)".

Now it's time to pay the bills, whoa, Nelly.

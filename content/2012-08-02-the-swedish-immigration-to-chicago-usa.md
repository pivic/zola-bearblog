Kristin recently popped in and got the below sheet. Even though a lot of the document relates to items as part of an exhibition, to me, it's always fun and weird to read foreign references and statements about the country I live in and of Swedish things, including translations of street-names, e.g. "Herring Street" (Sillgatan). It's a bit like an out-of-body experience. _"Is that us?"_

And they have a [Raoul Wallenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Wallenberg) room. Party on.

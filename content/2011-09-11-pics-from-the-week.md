SL, the transit company in Stockholm that monopolises all subway traffic, has started putting up big screens in the subway. I first saw one in Slussen, and the above is from Rådmansgatan subway station. It's all weird to stand around watching advertisements even permeate you through moving pictures, as the subway stations in Stockholm are already filled with non-moving pictures.

I guess I'm reacting like this due to having recently seen Morgan Spurlock's "_[The Greatest Movie Ever Sold](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ng2P3zxfM)_", where one learns of a city in Brazil where all public advertisement has been banned: no ads on walls, cars, et.c. It seemed quite wonderful.

Friday actually started with this ghastly thing turning up fixed to one of the walls in my office. I knew whom to thank. It didn't smell more than polythene at the time.

Having returned from a meeting, I sensed a very ghastly smell, that of old men who cannot clean themselves, whose bodily odours transforms into smelling like runny, smelly goat-cheese and wee. I could immediately sense from where the smell originated.

I picked up this little tree and smelled it. Two hours later, the odour was still lodged in my nostrils and laid deeply ensconced in my mind. I nearly vomited twice, in case you wanted to know. I walked with the tree to the culprit and tossed it at him. He was actually laughing until the thing touched him, and it apparently is some sort of practical joke-thing, a flask filled with "liquid shit", which he claims to have sprayed onto my colleague's desk as well...

Speaking of the affected colleague, this is how he hit one of my office screens after I bit one of his.

Every Friday at work, we're dealt pastries. Yeay sugary morning!

This is a hex incense mix: the base is a charcoal bit and then you just sprinkle stuff with inventive names on top. Some of that's resin and sandalwood. I haven't used one for years, so when X came home from work the morning I'd used that she nearly suffocated and I just about made out her contours through the fog that the incense had produced...

From a supermarket near work. The sign says "Welcome! Free banana for all small children."

Mariatorget. As summer is slipping into autumn it's great to see people still outdoors, not focusing on getting from point A to point B as quickly as possible.

Found in Mariatorget.

Something I came across just outside work: a fire safety class was being held.

Stureplan, à–stermalm. The posh side of town, as I explained it to Patrick.

Kungsgatan, between Stureplan and à–stermalm.

Evacuating trains at Skärmarbrink one morning on the way to work. Somebody said the following through the speaker system for all to hear: "Replacement buses will replace the trains, but they don't stop at Skärmarbrink, so do what you want to do."

If I were to design a picture that would adorn a coffee-machine I don't think "serenity" is a word that would come to mind. "Yeah, let's put a picture up of a person who's looking really calm, because that's what coffee does to ya!"

A colleague threw a bouncing ball at me and managed to knock my cup of coffee into the wall.

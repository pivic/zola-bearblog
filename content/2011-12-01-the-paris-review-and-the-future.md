Not only is **[The Paris Review](http://www.theparisreview.org)**'s new issue beautiful, but it's probably also really worth checking out.

I wish Miranda July's "_The Future_" were as good as "_Me And You And Everyone We Know_". It wasn't! [I had such hopes](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5911). Sob.

Seeing that film was like watching a good friend reach devolution. Sad, that. I've reviewed the film [here](http://www.allconsuming.net/person/pivic/progress/8064425). I think I'd rather [try to collect Blixa's hair and make clothes out of it](http://quirkbooks.com/book/crafting-cat-hair).

Still, there's loads of other brilliant things to dream about. Can't wait to get home today!

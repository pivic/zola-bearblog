Wee!

By clicking [here](http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtv2/home/24092007/mtv_album_leak_babyshambles_exclusive), you can pre-listen to the coming album in its entirety. The album is released on Monday, and is produced by [Stephen Street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Street), who's really cleaned up [Mick Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jones_%28The_Clash%29)' sound as heard on the 'shambles' debut album.

Oh, click [here](http://www.parlophone.co.uk/babyshambles/timesdownload/download.php?FILENAME=babyshambles-lost_art_of_murder.mp3&DOWNLOAD=1) to download a track off the album; it's "The Lost Art Of Murder" featuring [Bert Jansch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Jansch). This track is uploaded by Parlophone (the band's label) so it's for free and is legally OK.

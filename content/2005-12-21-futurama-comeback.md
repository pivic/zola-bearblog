I really hope that Futurama's coming back, and according to Mr. Groening, [this might be happening](http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/off-the-planet/2005/12/10/1134086846734.html). I really, really hope so. The [rumours of a straight-to-DVD release](http://www.gotfuturama.com/Futurama/News/1121562320,52120,/) have been spreading since long, but I really hope that this series will make its return, as I love it.

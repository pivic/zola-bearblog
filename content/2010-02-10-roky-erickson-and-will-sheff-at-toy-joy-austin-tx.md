Come 2010-04-20, [Roky Erickson](http://www.rokyerickson.net) will release his new album, "[**True Love Cast Out All Evil**](http://www.amazon.com/True-Love-Cast-Out-Evil/dp/B0035YPYPO)", as accompanied by [Okkervil River](http://www.okkervilriver.com). Here's a flash of how beautiful it will be as Will and Roky visit a toy store in [Austin, Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin%2C_Texas "Austin, Texas").

[From The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/jan/13/roky-erickson-release-new-material):

> "This is not a cynical comeback record, a lukewarm update on an established legacy ““ these are the best songs Roky has ever written," claims Okkervil River's Will Sheff, who produced the album. "This record has been the most challenging and rewarding thing I've ever worked on, and we in Okkervil River were deeply honoured to show up decades later and help Roky carry these wonderful songs over the finish line."

And let's not forget a brilliant screen-shot of [Will Sheff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Sheff "Will Sheff") in this video:

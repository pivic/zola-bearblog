It's been a while! I'm not dead yet mother)#/)!=)(! as Richard Pryor would say. For a complete list of all my previous Spotify playlists, check [this site](http://spotify.pivic.com).

I discovered Trentemà¸ller a few years ago when he started releasing remixes, but really got into his music very recently; the album "[The Last Resort](http://open.spotify.com/album/5Hsw2iSwkn9LWgWGruK4Xx)" is a quite blinding piece, mixing ambient electronics with beats and melodies that waver and taper across the Nordic stuff reminiscent to Biosphere, Pansonic and Röyksopp, while being more accessible; to me, at least.

Which brought me to Massive Attack. I've been listening to them for ages, even though I pretty much gave up following "**[Protection](http://open.spotify.com/album/5CnZjFfPDmxOX7KnWLLqpC)**", which to me was celebratory. On the other hand, 3D churned out a really good, [Georges Delerue](http://www.mfiles.co.uk/composers/Georges-Delerue.htm)\-inspired soundtrack for "_[Danny The Dog](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0342258/)_", where I think 3D really excelled. A sole, concentrated listen to the track on this playlist should remind you of what Massive Attack can be able to do. I'm really looking forward to hearing their new album, whenever it drops; should be by the end of this year or at the start of the next. And I hope they're bringing in [Horace Andy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace%20Andy) to do more, like he did in their live cover of "_Light My Fire_".

There's been a lot of 80s revival stuff lately, ranging from clothes to music. As if you didn't know. Which is why I'm overwhelmed by some real stuff from the 80s that's really, really good, like Kano's "_Ikeya-Seki_", which I found on Chromeo's " **[DJ-KICKS](http://open.spotify.com/album/09gLvFPLselzHtoyYDHLdP)**". I also reminisce about [the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YzfmEQ400#t=5) for Soft Cell's "_Say Hello, Wave Goodbye_", where Marc Almond looks quite insane as ever, but the track is sweet in an awkward way. Speaking of awkward, I seldom like covers of tracks by Queen but Swedish band Fibes, Oh Fibes! have actually managed a great synth-solo in "Don't Stop Me Now", which has been toned down in comparison with the original track; I think that's a safe way to go, as I think mimicking Mercury's energy and voice would be insane. Covers that try to sound like the original always fail, anyway.

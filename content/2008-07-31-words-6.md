- **pet peeve**. a minor annoyance that can instill great frustration in an individual.
- **perspicuity**. clarity as a consequence of being perspicuous ((transparently clear; easily understandable))
- **mollify**. to soothe in temper or disposition.
- **brevity**. shortness of duration.
- **myopic**. a condition in which the visual images come to a focus in front of the retina of the eye resulting especially in defective vision of distant objects.
- **cusp**. a point of transition (as from one historical period to the next).
- **grits**. a Native American corn-based food common in the Southern United States, consisting of coarsely ground corn.
- **erudition**. extensive knowledge acquired chiefly from books.
- **widow's peak**. a point formed by the hairline in front. ((Picture examples are available [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widow%27s_peak))).

Ooh, my neck and head have been hurting like hell since the week-end, which must be due to kismet...I'm exploring new spaces at work and it's quite the turn-off considering how much I hurt. Oh, poor me, smarting and having to be smart. Shut up, at least I can pretend, can't I?

Come Saturday it's [indie night at Debaser Medis](http://debaser.nu/shopexd.asp?id=353#353), where a whopping 20 years of indie will be celebrated, mostly because a double compilation album has been released. So put on yer dancing shoes and get next to somebody while whylin' away to Orange Juice and Broder Daniel.

Speaking of music, imagine a way to make music using a computer to aid you, without being bothered to use a bleeding sequencer. [This](http://www.rageousmusic.com/?p=9) might be it.

While I like films that turn out quite similar to the books on which they're based, Frank Miller's [300](http://www.solaceincinema.com/2006/10/04/300-comic-to-screen-comparison) seems like an extreme event, becoming one bigger than [Sin City](http://www.filmrot.com/images/sincity-comparisons/sincity.html). I feel like one of the few who never liked Sin City, apart from the (most) psychopathic killer in the film.

I like [Mystery Jets](http://www.mysteryjets.com), the band, that is. And I like [Steven Colbert](http://www.newyorkmetro.com/news/politics/22322); who doesn't? Maybe Dubya. More Colbert, this time vs George Lucas, [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpzTPpfoi1k).

_Oh life, Little con, little pro Little dancing with fairies I'm glad this is our time_

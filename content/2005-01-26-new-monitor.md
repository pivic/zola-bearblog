Today, I bought a new monitor. It was time to get rid of the old one, a 17" CRT-screen which works, but is too big for our computer-table, so here are a few pictures of the new one. As I have a flat 17" TFT-screen at work I've grown to like it more and more: less radiation, you don't get tired as fast, your eyes don't feel "tired" after sitting in front of it for a few hours straight, and you generally are more productive. So at work we've bought and delivered over 200 flat-screens for the workers. Work more efficiently now, y'hear? Work! Work!

Anyway, I checked out a little info on the web about this and found a hardware test from Tom's Hardware Guide on 19" TFT-displays, called "[Can 19" LCD screens pass the frag test?](http://graphics.tomshardware.com/display/20050110/lcd-17.html)" where nerds asked themselves of games are fit for the flat-screens or not. As CRT-screens display images a lot more rapid than TFT-screens, this fact has posed a problem for gamers. Now, however, there are TFT's that perform very well in their response-times.

So I checked the web for a nice 17" flat-screen and found a lot, but then I came across a campaign at Webhallen, where they sold an LG1915S for under 4000SKR, which isn't all that much. I mean, it's a bunch of money, but it'd mean a bigger screen and so forth. Anyway, I bought it. The test didn't incorporate my screen, but they did mention it in the end of the article:

> We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Philips panels and the growing popularity of the LG1915s is more than justified. Its price/performance ratio makes it a very tempting choice.

So there. I bought the 19" monitor, and it now rests firmly where the old one sat, taking up much less space. [Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-01-26) are pictures of the new one, and do compare them with [these](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-12-19) pictures of the old monitor.

Oh, that bird from yesterday mentions that the Doves album just gets better and better. They're like U2, Spiritualized and Radiohead merged into one (with U2 starting to make good music again, stating that they're crap since "Achtung Baby"). I can get a little numb from that music at times, it's the same with Mercury Rev and other "dream-music-bands" that I detest after a while, but Doves have good melodies, a fair sound and a few shouts of brilliance.

Oh, another thing. Never, ever buy a G-Unit/50 Cent-related mixtape. Ever.

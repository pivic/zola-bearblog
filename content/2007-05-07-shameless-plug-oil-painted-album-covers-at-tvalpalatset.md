[Oskar](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/428610298) has just received a few shipped oil-paintings that will soon show up at [Tvålpalatset](http://www.tvalpalatset.se), my favourite café in the south side of Stockholm city.

They're for show as well as for sale, and you can even order an album-cover of your own, just as long as you bring the cover and 3000SKR, which is quite little money; this covers the entire creation of the painting in itself, postage and packing plus framing, all done in 6-8 weeks. Very attractive, wouldn't you say?

Here's an example, but check [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/488089399) Velvet Underground cover and [this one](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/488089457) by OutKast as well.

There's snow outside, and PJ Harvey's new album has leaked. I felt strong winds as I walked short distances outdoors in search for stuffs for tonight. Bj√∂rn's coming over and we're stocked. And stoked!

I'm reading "[You're a Horrible Person, But I Like You: The Believer Book of Advice](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307475239?tag=niklasblog-20)" a fictional Q&A book where comedians and other people answer simple questions, e.g. \[abridged\] "How do I eat peach in public while retaining my dignity?" and "How do I tell my girlfriend that her mustache turns me off?". So far, I've read 72% of it, and I've laughed out loud ((For real; come, now.)) a total of four times.

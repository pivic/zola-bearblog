[Click here](http://images2.shockwave.com/afassets/flash/goodtobeindc.swf) to see the new JibJab animation on Dubya and Kerry. I think the gay part must be due to this being so "I-won't-touch-it-with-a-ten-foot-pole", because of some people wanting the pole. Eh. Anyway, I think American media (among others, of course, like Swedish ones) are still full with masonic twats who feel homosexuality's frightening.

[![32/2011: trettiotvå poeter tjugohundraelva](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1322648873m/13130025.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13130025) [32/2011: trettiotvå poeter tjugohundraelva](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13130025) by [Johannes Anyuru](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/657736)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/241419162)  
  
A very good Swedish poetry anthology. All over, it collates Swedish contemporaries by pulling stuff from their published works and is very recent in its content.

My faves, in no specific order:

Tuija Nieminen Kristoferson, Johannes Anyuru, åsa Ericsdotter, Leif Holmstrand and åsa Maria Kraft.

[![The Unwritten Vol. 1: Tommy Taylor and the Bogus Identity](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1276171942m/6471550.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6471550-the-unwritten-vol-1)[The Unwritten Vol. 1: Tommy Taylor and the Bogus Identity](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6471550-the-unwritten-vol-1) by [Mike Carey](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9018.Mike_Carey)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/164551905)  
  
At the comics shop, I asked for something that would fill the mind of somebody who loves "The Filth", "Transmetropolitan" and "V For Vendetta", and got this.  
  
It's the story of Tom Taylor, whose father created the Tommy Taylor enterprise, a long series of books about a boy wizard with round glasses and...yes, it's a poke at Harry Potter.  
  
Tom Taylor's bored with going from comic-con to comicon, until he is suddenly pointed out as a fraud and some otherworldly characters make their move onto him, post-stalking. I won't reveal more of the plot and story, but suffice to say, Mike Carey has culled a lot from the world of fiction. While there is an abundance of social commentary, dark humor and little annotations on the plot in the shape of parallel universe goings-on, it all helps out to make what is a very non-complex story told in a straightforward, well-written way.  
  
This is a very promising start to a series that might end nowhere or become increasingly epic and distorted. I'm hoping for the latter.  
  
Inked and penned nicely (with the obvious use of computer effects, e.g. fading and toning) the story drives the graphics rather than the other way around, even though the stray use of unconventional framing is very welcome.  
  
All in all: a very nice start.

[![A New World Record](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0000025DT.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000F8O4DQ%26tag=niklasblog-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000F8O4DQ%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")While out clubbing on Friday night at [Guilty Pleasures](http://www.debaser.nu/shopexd.asp?id=331), a DJ dropped this old [ELO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Light_Orchestra) classic; well, I wasn't aware of it at the time it first was released (as part of ELO's album ["A New World Record"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B0000025DT%26tag=niklasblog-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B0000025DT%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "the album")) as I wasn't even born at the time; a great track's a great track, and this is the type of track that makes you love it even if you feel you should hate its MOR/AOR quality - it's a great track. It makes you wail, throw your hands in the air, move your hips, sing along and do moves you've never seen live before.

At the club, when the track started playing, with the camp orchestral-cum-Jewish-violin intro, people left the floor; the ones who didn't know the track, anyway. I think I last heard it off ["Back to Mine: Compiled By Liam Howlett"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000BVPYPO%26tag=niklasblog-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000BVPYPO%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon") where it closed the album, so the track was quite fresh in memory.

As the verses on the track are so hook-filled people started swarming the floor, but the first time the chorus hit, people _stormed_ to dance. Even [Anders](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/32926714) bum-rushed the floor and all went happy. It's a great thing, that, when _you_ know a track will drop and rule the world but others don't, and you just wait to see everybody mass-react with sheer glee.

As usual, track will only be available for a week.

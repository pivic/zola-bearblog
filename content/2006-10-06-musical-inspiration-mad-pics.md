I like [this list](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1888085,00.html) courtesy of The Guardian, where loads of musicians have listed "music's secret weapons". Johnny Marr's recital of a bit of Roy Harper's "Stormcock" is great:

> The critic rubs his tired arse / Scrapes his poor brains, strains and farts / And wields a pen that stops and starts / And thinks in terms of booze and tarts / And sits there playing with his parts / He says I'm much too crude and far too coarse / And he says this singer's just a farce / He's got no healing formulas / He's got no cure-all for our scars / He's got no bra strap for our bras / And our sagging tits no longer hold a full house of hearts / And you know what? I don't think this little song's gonna make the charts.

...as is actually a list that doesn't have anything with that one to do, i.e. [Iggy & The Stooges' rider](http://www.prefixmag.com/blog/prefix/2006/10/05/iggy-and-the-stooges-rider). As they evidently have gained humour since the good ole days, I think their little reunion might be a great one.

Speaking of lists, check [this one](http://www.vadriven.com/forums/showthread.php?t=157745), and don't say I warned you for laughing.

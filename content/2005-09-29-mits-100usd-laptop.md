Mr. Negroponte of MIT recently unveiled the "$100 laptop", i.e. a laptop machine running Linux that would cost 100USD to buy. They want to put it into mass production, aiming for the poor people of the world. Now that's what I'm into! Sweetness!

Check out pictures of the thing [here](http://beta.news.com.com/2300-1044_3-5884639-1.html). Evidently, a lot of thought has gone into it. I really, really hope this project reaches fruition.

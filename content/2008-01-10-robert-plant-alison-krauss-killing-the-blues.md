![Robert Plant & Alison Krauss](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-01-10-rpak.jpg)One of the albums of 2007 that I apparently missed, was "_Raising Sand_" by [Robert Plant and Alison Krauss](http://www.robertplantalisonkrauss.com). This sublime album is acoustic and country in essence, but has quite a few twists. For instance, "Sister Rosetta Goes Before Us" carries an Arabic tinge. Plant's voice hasn't sounded this good for a long time. Krauss sounds like what I imagine [Neko Case](http://nekocase.com) could in 20-30 years. [T-Bone Burnett](http://www.tboneburnett.com) has done good with the production of this album, creating a simple sound where the instruments and sheer song-material rules, not dreadful effects.

Here's the wonderful, almost bedtime-story-ish track "Killing The Blues", which will be gone after a week's stay at my blog.

Unexpected bonus: [this free track](http://www.nekocase.com/music/mp3/misc/Behind_The_House%5Bdemo%5D.mp3) from Neko Case that she's releasing due to her re-issuing her three albums.

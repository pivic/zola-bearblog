The man was bisexual, true or false? Even though Oliver Stone thinks so [in an interview with CHUD](http://chud.com/interviews/522), he probably won't portray it much. I hope he does, and sinks the myth of Alexander The Great as a wonderful heterosexual lover, whose manliness made him conquer most of Europe during his time. Mind you, he died a mere twentysomething. And about the fagginess? Oh yeah, Stone says the following about Alexander's attraction to Hephaestion, his "right hand man":

> It'll be a debate if Alexander cracked up when Hephaestion died. And we know by that, that was the love of his life. He cracked up. He built a six story high funeral pyre. He grieved for months. He was reportedly, tabloid has it, he had the doctor executed. There were times we wandered into the tabloid side, but we don't know exactly what happened. Something like that could have happened because he was very angry reportedly. Very angry and of course, he grieved hugely. The only man he trusted in the end, not even Ptolemy, was Hephaestion.

We'll see, in time, what Stone made up. When lying in the couch at home during Monday, I watched a documentary on Alexander The Great, which was quite good. The researchers tried to find out how he died. He became ill quite fast, died within 12 days from becoming ill, and nobody really knows why he died. In the documentary, scientists tried different theories to see if he was poisoned (as many believe Hephaestion was) to death or died because of medicines ill-dosed, contributing to his death. Interesting. It's a little like "Who was Jack The Ripper?"

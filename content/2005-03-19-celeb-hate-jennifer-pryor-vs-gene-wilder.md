[Here](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7230291/site/newsweek/page/2)'s a cut of an interview with Gene Wilder as he's busy pimping his memoirs, where he's enlightened to know that Jennifer, [Richard Pryor](http://www.richardpryor.com/history.cfm)'s wife, hates him. From the Wilder interview:

> **Interviewer**: Richard Pryor's wife Jennifer posted an angry response online to your portrayal of him. **Gene Wilder**: That's a surprise. If they'd read the book, they wouldn't, I don't think, say I was denigrating him or his talent. I didn't tell anything that wasn't true. The only thing I said was my definition of \[Pryor as\] sullen \[was\] because you never knew with him. He was so sweet, at times angelic, and he would become so morose, and you'd say, “Why, with all that talent?“ If Richard had read the book, or had someone read the book to him, I think he would be not at all upset by anything that I said about it. He could say, “I wish he hadn't told that story that I was late \[to the 'Stir Crazy' set\].“ But if you ask any of the people on the crew or the cast, ask Sidney Poitier, it wasn't a secret. But all the loving things“”when we first met, the respect we had for each other“”I hope we still do. He's the one who taught me to improvise in front of a camera.

> In Gene's new book, he trashes Richard! He claims Richard was making demands, "when he was high" during this period when Gilda Radnor, Gene's wife at the time, had cancer and was seriously ill. She passed away in May 1989. I was with Richard at this time; they were shooting "See no Evil, Hear no Evil" in New York---we were back together and I was also working with him...he was using sporadically. Here's what I find interesting...Gene claims Richard was making demands...I was on set much of the time and Richard was nothing but cooperative and fun. But here is the irony---of course, it was a difficult time for Gene because of his wife's illness but Richard was upset because of some of Gene's actions that certify him as a raging hypocrit! This really bothered Richard. Gene's role as a saint is less than perfect...his role is that of sanctimonious hypocrit...and believe me, Richard filled me in plenty!!! Yet he trashes Richard....go figure!They were never friends and this is why...one tells the truth and the other doesn't know what the fuck it is... Apparently Gene believes in trashing people when they are sick!!!

> All the comics believe he rode in on Richard's coat-tails...he has a lot of nerve to knock Richard......so he is our nominee and winner of the hypocrisy and medicority award!Loser YO GENE: When you're "Looking back with bitterness towards Richard Pryor", you should also be fucking grateful you had a good ride on those coattails! And take a good look at yourself, while your at it...motherfucker!

That's a long way for me to say: Jennifer seems to be like her husband. Wee! I love it when people speak frankly. I have no idea of who's telling the truth here and I really don't care. I think the interesting thing is the way with words, which actually says a lot to me.

From [onegoodmove](http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/001957.html):

> During his trip to Germany on Wednesday, the main highlight of George W. Bush's trip was meant to be a "town hall"-style meeting with average Germans. But with the German government unwilling to permit a scripted event with questions approved in advance, the White House has quietly put the event on ice. Was Bush afraid the event might focus on prickly questions about Iraq and Iran rather than the rosy future he's been touting in Europe this week?

Too bad it just shows Dubya's basically unable to think. Or rather, think in a democratically good way.

Go, Germany!

Today I was notified that Florida legislation has gone insane. Apparently, it's no longer enough with [God presiding over the USA in all judicial way](https://niklasblog.com/?p=563)s - now you're as good as dead if you're "appearing threatening" while in the state of Florida. Check this:

> Florida's "stand your ground" law, which took effect Saturday, means that people no longer must attempt to retreat or defuse a threatening situation before using violence in order to later claim they were acting in self-defence. People already had that right in their homes, but the law now allows them to meet "force with force" in any place they have a legal right to be.

Oh, don't forget a little bonus, here:

> The right does not apply if the person is confronted by a law-enforcement officer.

Congrats, you're in Florida. Congrats, you're in danger. Read the entire article [here](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20051004.wdeadly1004/BNStory/International).

I've caught the [Madlib](http://www.stonesthrow.com/madlib)\-produced album titelled "[Yesterday's New Quintet Presents: Sound Directions - The Funky Side Of Life](http://www.stonesthrow.com/sounddirections)". It's so funky, it's so good, and the drums, the bass, the organs, the...aaah! It's so good, and reminds me of the love I felt for "[Jazz Spectrum](http://www.bbemusic.com/data.pl?release=BBECD016)", the great album compiled by Keb Darge and Bob Jones off [BBE](http://www.bbemusic.com). There are sound-bites off "JS" on the page I linked to, so go there, get psyched and buy the album if you haven't heard it. Anyway, on the "Funky" album à¡ la Madlib:

> "The Funky Side of Life" represents Madlib's first full length collaboration with session musicians ““ players whose tenures include Macy Gray, The Dap Kings, Antibalas, Breakestra and Connie Price and The Keystones ““ on horns, guitar and backup keyboards. The horns were arranged by Todd Simon and Madlib himself helms the organ, bass and drums for most of album, except for a track or two where he includes the hammering funk breaks of UK drummer extraordinaire Malcolm Catto (MoWax, DJ Shadow).

And now...for tech nerdery. I recently found [Writeboard](http://writeboard.com), a system for collaborating and editing pieces of text, and even comparing versions of it. There are bits of the system that I like, and others I dislike. Shakedown time!

_Likes_: the service is free, allows people to edit text and also to compare it; one can even compare different versions, saved by different people, all logged in using the same password. Anybody using a browser can access it.

_Dislikes_: the system doesn't like "weird characters", for instance Swedish - while editing it's OK, but if you export the stuff to HTML it looks like crap. The biggest issue is when you've pasted pre-formatted content into Writeboard, had it edited and then attempt to make it look good in the original application, say, Microsoft Word, for instance. It's Notepad-to-Word, so don't paste any special, preformatted text into Writeboard.

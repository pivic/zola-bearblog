[![Marie Laveau](http://static.flickr.com/50/134263467_344517a033_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=134263467) ROCK! Come Saturday, Rade and I will experience [Boban Markovic at SÃ¶dra Teatern](http://www.sodrateatern.com/html/programArtist.asp?prodnr=12620)! [The man and his _orkestar_](http://www.piranha.de/records/english/artists/art_boban.htm) has performed music for Kusturica and will - I hope - knock the socks off [Svarta Safirer](https://niklasblog.com/?p=937).

Speaking of music, I ordered a [Line6 Spider II 30](http://www.line6.com/spiderii/30.html) today, to replace the old guitar-amp I loaned from Jesper for appx. 10 years.

Speaking of music, [get "Country Girl" today](http://somevelvetblog.blogspot.com/2006/04/primal-scream-ii.html). And Asian Dub Foundation has created an opera around Khadafi. Whassup! I love their "[Rafi's Revenge](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=niklasblog-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00000DLV4)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)".

Oh, by no way, [a fetish group demonstrated outside my work-place yesterday](http://qx.se/nyheter/artikel.php?artikelid=4329). Why? Because they thought the department that issues permits to people wishing to serve alcohol legally are...homophobic. And I think three of those working there are actually gay.

What did I tell you? An American kid eats [a bag of crisps every hour](http://feeds.feedburner.com/boingboing/iBag?m=962) that he/she watches TV. Aaah! Put [these](http://www.goatsesticker.com) on their foreheads. Or [frame somebody that owns a Macintosh](http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatsesticker/130647005/in/pool-laptopstickers) (even if that's yourself).

[![Tussan](http://static.flickr.com/54/134226812_1a79e57512_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=134226812) On the glad side of food, Frederic tipped me about [this DVD](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=niklasblog-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0061157074)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1) where Anthony Bourdain interviews the owner (and one of the chefs) of El Bulli, reportedly one of the best restaurants in the world

Robert Greenwald is on the move with [a documentary on the war in Iraq](http://iraqforsale.org), which can only be finished through donations.

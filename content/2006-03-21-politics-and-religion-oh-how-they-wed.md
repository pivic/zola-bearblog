Amazon have [tweaked their search-results](http://www.wired.com/news/wireservice/0,70453-0.html) so that searching for "abortion" gives you "Did you mean adoption?". An information-person from Amazon says that's merely a technicality, as the two words are close, but searching for "adoption" _does not_ render "Did you mean abortion?". How very political, Amazon.

Writing on politics, did you know that Pat Robertson, big TV-preacher in the USA, recently called moslems "[motivated by demonic powers](http://mediamatters.org/items/200603140008)" and added that "the goal of Islam...is world domination"? Don't worry, Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and host of the daily Christian radio show "The Albert Mohler Program", claimed that Buddhism, Hinduism, and Marxism are "[demonstration\[s\] of satanic power](http://mediamatters.org/items/200603200013)". How did Marxism get in there? And what about Christianity? Lo and behold, the intellectual reaper hasth cometh. Or sooneth, anywaythhth. Thank Bog that [some christians seem fair-minded](http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,1735730,00.html):

> The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, has stepped into the controversy between religious fundamentalists and scientists by saying that he does not believe that creationism - the Bible-based account of the origins of the world - should be taught in schools.

The autocratic president of Turkmenistan [says anybody who reads his book three times will go to heaven](http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,1735866,00.html).

However, [don't forget the poor scientologists](http://www.theonion.com/content/node/46512) just yet.

Thorsten van Elten runs a company that produces and sells special furniture and other objects you use to apparel your home. Mikaela first found the [Pigeon Light](http://www.thorstenvanelten.com/products/showProduct.php?prod=3) in the latest number of Living Etc. I e-mailed him and received very quick and helpful response.

After rummaging through the catalogue at their site, I quickly found other interesting articles, like the [Digital Stag](http://www.thorstenvanelten.com/products/showProduct.php?prod=76), [What's your poison?](http://www.thorstenvanelten.com/products/showProduct.php?prod=85) and [Light Reading](http://www.thorstenvanelten.com/products/showProduct.php?prod=4).

Taken outside work a few days ago. It's about as mushy as it looks, even without the effects.

Yes, I've gone bonkers with effects and filters.

From the back of a tee I bought while in Austin last time.

Near work. This effect reminds of "[**Begotten**](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5731)", which I still haven't seen.

More from work; both the collage and the one-shot are taken from the same spot.

The bottom of this label reads, as translated by me: "Devilbrew Brewery" - "A damn good beer!"

The back of it says: "Expiration date: Judgement Day".

Söderhallarna, a kind of mall but more food than shopping. Went there to pick up tickets for the new Sherlock Holmes flick and to buy some wonderful olives; some stuffed with pimento, others with parmesan cheese. Yum.

Upon returning the Sherlock Holmes tickets yesterday. We were just too ill to go, and actually had to cancel several arrangements during the weekend. Fuck.

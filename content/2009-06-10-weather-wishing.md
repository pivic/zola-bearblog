Why isn't the weather in Stockholm like the above? That was shot _five weeks ago_, laying on grass outdoors. Isn't the weather supposed to get warmer as we get closer to summer, or should I say the _supposed_ summer? I'm tired of this. I know I'm a nagging bitch but I need good weather. And X. And a blanket, some fruit, beverages and love. Please, please, please.

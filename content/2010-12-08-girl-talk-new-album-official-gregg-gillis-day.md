![Girl Talk - All Day](http://pigeonsandplanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/girl-talk-all-day-500x500.jpg)

There's a new album out by Gregg Gillis, a.k.a. Girl Talk! Of course it's [available for free from Illegal Art](http://illegal-art.net/allday), and it's really good. Of course. Just a few minutes in, and I hear Beastie Boys, Missy Elliott, Beck, Ludacris, Devo, Radiohead, Ramones, Blondie, Lady Gaga, Pet Shop Boys... it's so good. I've gotta say mashing Portishead's "_Sour Times_" with Mobb Deep's "_Ante Up_" is a stroke of genius. Or Radiohead's "_Creep_" with Ol' Dirty Bastard's "_Shimmy Shimmy Ya_". Or Beastie Boys' "_Hey Ladies_" with Iggy Pop's "_Lust For Life_".

And he now has _his own day_ in Pittsburgh, USA. This is even more awesome than Oklahoma stating that The Flaming Lips' "_Do You Realize??_" is [the official rock song of OK](http://www.oklahomarocksong.org). But what does "his own day" mean? Check this:

> "BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby declare December 7, 2010 'Gregg Gillis Day' in the City of Pittsburgh." ((As stated [here](http://twitpic.com/3dsj8m).))

Also, get a load of this official picture of Girl Talk getting all of that notarised:

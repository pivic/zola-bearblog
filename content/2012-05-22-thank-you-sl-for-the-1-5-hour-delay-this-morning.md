Bagarmossen. I love how it seems one person is **trying to hitch-hike**.

Skärmarbrink, where everyone had to leave the subway.

Eventually, I left the station and went back one, in order to catch a prior train...oh god.

At Hammarbyhöjden, where a train finally came. The signs said "Gullmarsplan" but the driver informed us that even the information on the train was erroneous on this day; it went further than that.

Yuck. I hate late trains.

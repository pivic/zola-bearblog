[![More about Buddy Does Jersey](http://image.anobii.com/anobi/image_book.php?type=4&item_id=01464246f72b7807e4&time=1209735308 "More about Buddy Does Jersey")](http://www.anobii.com/books/Buddy_Does_Jersey/9781560978374/01464246f72b7807e4/ "More about Buddy Does Jersey")This morning on the way to work, I was sitting down on the subway with my ubiquitous ear-covering head phones, listening to music while reading Peter Bagge's "_Buddy Does Jersey_", the second collection of comics from Bagge's own comic magazine, when in the corner of my eyes I saw a person sitting opposite me behaving like an owl, moving his head and upper body back and forth. His eyes locked with mine; he looked about 50 years old, a little frustrated and frowning, and I quickly removed my head phones.

**I**: Pardon? **He**: I've been speaking with you! **I**: Sorry...I was listening to music. **He**: Well...what you readin' there? What's the title? **I**: Um, it's "_Buddy Does Jersey_", by Peter Bagge. **He**: Yeah?

Insert a too long, quite bizarre pause here.

**He**: What type-a comic is it? **I**: Well, it's about a guy named Buddy and his life. It's about the relationships in his life, during the mid 90s. **He**: Well, well...son's turning 15 soon. I was thinkin' of gettin' somethin' for 'im.

_Something_? I hope said kid usually gets something for his birthday. Insert awkward pause here, where the guy just stared at me.

**He**: Is it violent? With people who hate each-other?

Wow! What a weird second question, I thought.

**I**: No, not particularly violent, and I wouldn't say it's filled with hate.

About here the train slowed down to stop at a station. The man got up.

**He**: Oh. Quick, what's it called?

This was in the early morning, the man was on his way and I felt stressed, and even though I'd already given him the title of the book, I could only think of the title of [the magazine](http://www.peterbagge.com/comics/hate.php) in which these comics first appeared.

**I**: "_Hate_".

The was already moving, looking perplexed as I tried to rectify the situation. Well, I just hope he heard me loudly call out "_Buddy Does New Jersey!_" and that there were a lot of Americans in the subway cart...

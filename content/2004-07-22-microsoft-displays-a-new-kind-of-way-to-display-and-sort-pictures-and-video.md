[Here](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=14275#14275)'s a video from MS displaying their maybe-coming software to display and sort pictures and video. I think it looks good, and shows MS trying to go towards [Apple](http://www.apple.com). Will this be built into Longhorn? We'll see.

Also, [here](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=14162)'s the MS VIBE (...) team showing new methods of using drag 'n' drop when working big surfaces.

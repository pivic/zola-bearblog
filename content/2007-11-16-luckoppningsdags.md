I'm cleaning my office to make it look more respectable, and this is one of the things I'm getting rid of. For all you non-Swedes, here's a laughable translation of an incomprehensible snippet from [Metro](http://www.metro.se):

> **Opening of Christmas calendar a disappointment**
> 
> **Södertälje** This Monday meant it was time for sisters Ida, Hanna and Clara Dahlgren to open the first day in their Christmas calendars.
> 
> The state of affairs was just as bad when mother checked the entire calendar. She couldn't swap for a new calendar, as they were sold-out in the shops.

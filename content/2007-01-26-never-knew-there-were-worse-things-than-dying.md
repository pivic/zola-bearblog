So sang Shane McGowan in The Pogues' "[The Band Played Waltzing Matilda](http://www.pogues.com/Releases/Lyrics/LPs/RumSodomy/Waltzing.html)". In fact, that emotion rings true when you're in a true rut. I cannot say I feel any different for right now.

Apart from personal issues and a grueling feeling I won't succeed at nailing my driver's license exam next Friday, everything's...fairly chaotic at work. I'm currently landing somewhat semi-paws-down. It's a bit like throwing fifty knifes into the air: some won't touch you, some will cut you, one may skewer your one hand badly and one or two might lop something off.

Still, all's well that ends well, eh?

[A peek in Jim Gilliam's blog](http://www.jimgilliam.com/2004/08/pirate_tv_erupts_in_italy.php) brought my attention to Silvio Berlusconi, about whom [I've written a little, previously](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=189). The following in this post is straight out of Jim's blog, all his words:

[Pirate TV erupts in Italy](http://www.jimgilliam.com/2004/08/pirate_tv_erupts_in_italy.php)

[Silvio Berlusconi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Berlusconi) is the wealthiest man in Italy, owns three national TV channels accounting for 45% of the audience, and according to the [Economist](http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=593654), has control over 90% of all television broadcasting in the country.

And he's also the prime minister.

So, naturally, an [underground movement](http://info.interactivist.net/article.pl?sid=04/03/19/200233&mode=nested&tid=15) of small neighborhood pirate TV stations has cropped up. 125 stations since last count. Here's a 30 minute documentary produced by a collective from Milan chronicling it all -- available in [streaming Realmedia](rtsp://realmedia.freespeech.org/new/media_democracy.rm/pirate_tv.rm) with English subtitles.

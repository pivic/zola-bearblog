Stephen Colbert speaks of how republicans want to cut all funding to Planned Parenthood, a non-profit organization providing reproductive health and maternal and child health services ((According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood).)); republican senator Jon Kyl claims 90% of what they do are abortions, which in reality is 3%.

When this was pointed out, his people press released info that "**his remark was not intended to be a factual statement**".

Colbert rips him apart. I love it. And how Fox News parades that you can get "pap smears and breast exams at Walgreens". Wonderful.

If you yawn at the usuals - i.e. dissing republicans - just watch the last minute to see Colbert being unable to keep his cool, disintegrating into laughter. Masterful ending.

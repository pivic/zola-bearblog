You know the feeling when you've hurt one of your fingers and it's affected over and over? You can't help but moving your hand and the smarting just jolts you every time?

I've bodily been feeling like that for a fair amount of time but didn't think that my lapse from doing yoga affected me so much, mentally; doing yoga really frees me mentally as well as physically, and this has nothing to do with the common misconception that yoga has anything to do with religion. Once and for all: "yoga" simply means "unity", and very little else. Check out the facts [here](http://www.ayri.org/method.html) and [here](http://www.ashtanga.com/html/background.html).

Having flowed through [surya namaskara](http://ashtangayoga.info/asana-vinyasa/surya-namaskara-a/index.html) I feel mentally and physically emancipated. My body's on fire and my mind is clearer. When your body's shit, your mind turns mushy, so...

I'm going to start doing Ashtanga yoga again, regularly.

I just woke up from having a weird dream.

I was somehow sharing a hotel-room with Pete Doherty, the main-man of [Babyshambles](http://www.babyshambles.net), and he was drunk. After trying to speak with him he started crying, accusing me of waving a knife at him. I thought he was just messing about, but then I got the picture, he actually meant what he was saying and I started crying as well, telling him no way would I point a knife at anybody and calm down and wondered whether it was actually his own words I was hearing or just drugs or/and alcohol speaking.

Soon after that he calmed down and I woke up from hearing a magpie caw. Again. Mikaela's found the source of that problem, which is a baby magpie. Aw. To add to that, though, a neighbourhood cat's in heat. This far, I have never been able to convince Mikaela to shut the window at night because of the sounds; normally, I've had a harder time falling asleep to the sounds of ye wilderbeast that wander yonder in Fruängen, but suddenly Mikaela's having a hard time too, which means she's prone to shut the window by herself. At morning we desperately open every window in the apartment due to near-asphyxiation.

[![Mikaela](http://static.flickr.com/69/168981136_d641b0b954_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=168981136) Yesterday [Mikaela](http://static.flickr.com/69/168981136_d641b0b954.jpg "Poser!") and I went with [Frederic, John](http://static.flickr.com/48/168980335_7b19a45411.jpg "Livers.") and [Fredrik](http://static.flickr.com/76/168980847_8ac7511e9d.jpg "Le photographeur.") to Gömmaren, a little lake not far from us (if one travels by car, that is). We sunbathed, ate lunch (well, Mikaela and I did, anyway) and talked which was really nice. Frederic is also getting a [MacBook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html) (yeah, I've decided for it) and we discussed whether the 2-3 day delivery-period [![](http://static.flickr.com/76/168980847_8ac7511e9d_m.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/44124300615@N01/168980847 "Fresj")for the gizmo (through Apple Store) means one gets the stuff 2-3 days after ordering, or they ship it 2-3 days after the order falls through, then adding 14 days for delivery until received. No-one seems to know. Oh, the agony. Oh, fucking materialistic horror. So anyway, we all ventured to a tiny café nearby and ordered a chocolate square, carrot cake and a vanilla doughnut. Fredrik, as pictured right, really wanted that vanilla doughnut. Ha! As you can tell, the guy's a photographer, perennially snapping good pictures. I wish he'd send more pictures my way every day. Thanks to [Flock](http://flock.com) I'm actually carrying a much better overview of my contacts' pictures as it contains a "photos topbar". It's brilliant. Also, it allows me to type in a tag for flickr, say, "[bonnaroo](http://flickr.com/search/?q=bonnaroo)" and I immediately get to see a lot of behind-the-scenes-pics taken at the big American music-festival going down at the moment.

Considering my bad experience with [Humac](http://humac.se) that I [mentioned previously](https://niklasblog.com/?p=965), I was prepared for the worst; with prejudice I started thinking maybe Apple-retailers were all bastards who felt the product would fly off their shelves no matter what their attitude was like. So, I was prepared for malarkey but was instead met with the happy voce of a quite good sales-person who really listened to what I was saying and _gave service_. Oh, I like it.

Anyway, after the coffee and cake we all went home; Mikaela and I watched "[Find Me Guilty](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419749)", a flick with [Vin Diesel](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004874) in it. He's getting better and better at acting - or maybe it's just that he's getting better roles nowadays. I really liked "[Pitch Black](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134847)" and "[The Chronicles Of Riddick](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0296572)", and I think he's more capable of acting than most big actors are.

Time to get to work for the last time before vacation kicks in, aah.

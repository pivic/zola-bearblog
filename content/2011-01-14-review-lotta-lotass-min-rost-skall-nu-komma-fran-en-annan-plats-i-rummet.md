[![Min röst skall nu komma från en annan plats i rummet](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1292705044m/9951679.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9951679-min-r-st-skall-nu-komma-fr-n-en-annan-plats-i-rummet)[Min röst skall nu komma från en annan plats i rummet](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9951679-min-r-st-skall-nu-komma-fr-n-en-annan-plats-i-rummet) by [Lotta Lotass](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1612626.Lotta_Lotass)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/139745296)  
  
This is a beautiful, poetic, straightforward, constructive (in the architect's sense of the word) and murderous (in the serial killer's sense of the word) tale of the building of a dam, the atomic bomb and a few serial killers.  
  
Lotass' language is flourid, tight and expanding, reminiscent of [Åsa Ericsdotter](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2992385._sa_Ericsdotter "åsa Ericsdotter")'s. The plot thickens and expands, and is as frightening as the prose avoids any type of languor, especially when she delves into explaining nature, it's physicalities and the building of a dam.  
  
The serial killers - but one - are based on real ones, and I found myself trying to peel back the pet names the author had given them; I'm still not entirely sure of exactly who's who, but that doesn't matter. What I feel does matter, however, is that Lotass takes the unusual path of describing and ascribing their cores without labelling them as monsters, which is to me always refreshing.  
  
This book definitely made me long for reading another book by the author, whom I haven't read before.

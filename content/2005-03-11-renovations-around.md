![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-11-sign.jpg)The persons who are to renovate the apartments surrounding ours, have just connected the shed [I previously wrote of](https://niklasblog.com/?p=510), to electricity. They've accomplished this by connecting electric wiring from the block of flats to the shed. This means the wire is crossing the asphalt road, where cars roll - but no worries, the wire is covered by a couple of boards of plywood. Anyway:

In spite of, or simply because of, their best efforts, I'm confounded. They've put a sign up to make people take heed of the wiring, and not chew it frantically or something likely. There is a bigger image of the sign available [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-11-sign1.jpg); I must say it's not quite simplifying things.

The sign is mis-spelled, which makes it funny (if you're bent that way) and reads: "WARNIG PIPE -->" That last word is as much a mystery to a Swedish reader, as to an English one. I hope. Otherwise I'm the nut.

Well, I don't care if the people who'll do the renovations are dyslexic, everybody knows what it's for when they read it, but there's one more thing. As you can almost tell from [this picture](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-11-sign2.jpg) of the sign from the other side, the sign is covered by bushes, rendering it quite unintelligible. You can't see it!

And a third issue: even if you should see the sign, what good is it? Aren't you supposed to run over the plywood boards? I think so. I walked on them, and they seem solid enough to have cars run over them.

I think the renovation people are smarter than we think. I'm expecting something like the [Monty Python "Confuse-A-Cat" skit](http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/confuse.htm), but we'll see. I'll keep all informed. If I live to tell the tale.

**edit**: I'm starting to think the last word is "PLOGA", which means "PLOUGH". They're afraid the people who plough snow will ruin their fine build! Oh! I do hope there's more beneath the snow, though, as "VARNIG Rà–R --> PLOGA" means "WARNIG PIPE --> PLOUGH" which probably makes sense in their world (whichever world that is) and absolute twaddle to everybody else. No matter, as any potential drivers won't be able to read it as the sign's rammed deep down in snow and covered by bushes.

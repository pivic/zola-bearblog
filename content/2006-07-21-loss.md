Yesterday I received a call from a dear friend, saying an old friend has committed suicide. I didn't know I'd feel this shitty about it.

I think dealing with what that person meant to you, what that person was like, thinking of his/her pros and cons...that _stays_, rather than trying to bury yourself in work or hide your feelings. Fuck that. I cry at work if I feel like it and I know it's OK. Things will get better, and all my sympathies and love go out to those affected by this, before all to my friend's family.

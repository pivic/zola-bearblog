Well, people seem to be quite saddened by the ever-coming advents of newer, publicly made-available builds of Microsoft Windows Vista, i.e. the new version of OSX Windows that's to be released in 2004 2005 2006 2007.

Until now, the betas have been quite uninteresting, apart from the fact that the OS looks better than the previous Windowses and devours enormous amounts of RAM. But suddenly, build 5536 is supposed to be better than the ones before, as in much better, at least [according to fanboy Paul Thurrott](http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/winvista_5536.asp). Well, what the hell. I mean, why slap Microsoft so much when they, unlike Apple, make operating systems that are (at least) semi-runnable as they don't lock you down to a certain hardware-platform? Apple, [your latest line of laptops is in shambles](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1029), which is why I'm pissed at them. Anyway, this boils down to two things: 1) I'm an old, grumpy man at 29 and 2) Apple are currently making me more interested in MS Windows than their own [OSX](http://www.apple.com/macosx).

Back to the new build of Vista: [UAC](https://niklasblog.com/?p=983) is apparently dramatically improved, but [Windows Live](http://www.live.com) has seemingly been integrated very hard into the OS, so much that people will want to compare it with forced marriage or rape. Both? And, erhm, judging from Thurrott's review, the whole dish is served with more colours. Charming.

I will run Vista off my Mac - that is, if I ever get it back plus up and running - and we'll see what happens. Oh, and Microsoft has changed one thing in the interface of [Office 2007](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/default.mspx), i.e. the coming version of MS Office: [they've made the ribbon minimise when not in use](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/Microsoft_winds_back_Office_ribbon/0,2000061733,39267508,00.htm). Good thing, I think. Less big toolbars equals more space.

Oh, and [the city of Kerala has skipped Windows entirely in all schools, in favour of Linux](http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=138464). Note that [Kerala made head-lines recently](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1026) when they told (not asked) the cola-companies to get out as their fizzy drinks are to be compared with pesticides.

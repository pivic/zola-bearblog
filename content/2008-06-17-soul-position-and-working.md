While commenting at [Seesmic](http://seesmic.com) some wonderful little videos are made. Victor, our new trainee, is seen in the background trying carry a lot of stuff at once, and I flaunt [Soul Position](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Position) in the speakers, all while Stockholm is drenched in rain.

Work really requires music at times.

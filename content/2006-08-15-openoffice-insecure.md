Is OpenOffice and its users secure? Researchers from The French Ministry of Defense say the following, courtesy of [this InfoWorld-article](http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/11/HNopenofficesecurity_1.html):

> "The general security of OpenOffice is insufficient," the researchers wrote in a paper entitled "In-depth analysis of the viral threats with OpenOffice.org documents."
> 
> "This suite is up to now still vulnerable to many potential malware attacks," they wrote.

This paper concludes that OpenOffice might even be more susceptible to exploits and attacks than Microsoft Office. However, the OpenOffice.org team welcomes the scrutinising of the code, and are at the moment working at solving the problems involved, as stated in [this open letter](http://www.openoffice.org/security/response_to_defence_ministry_leak.html). However, the breadth and depth of the security-problems have not surfaced yet.

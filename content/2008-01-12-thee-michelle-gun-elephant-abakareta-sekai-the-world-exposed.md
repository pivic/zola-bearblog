![TMGE](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-01-10-tmge.jpg)When TMGE broke up in 2003, they disbanded a Japanese garage legacy that lasted for 12 years and 9 albums, of which I love two (("Casanova Snake" and "Rodeo Tandem Beat Specter".)) especially.

I hadn't heard these guys until I saw the intro for the film "_[Blue Spring](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309291)_", which completely transfixed me. I had to get more of this band, and I did. I wasn't into garage unless you count [Jon Spencer Blues Explosion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Spencer_Blues_Explosion), and these guys had that and a bit more hip-shaking as well.

This track is brutal rock 'n' roll, cleanly produced and neatly packaged. Let's break my linguistics down to something more understandable, shall we? This track's fucking toil! It's a bomb! It will interfere with your vision! You will not be able to have children if you listen to this too loudly!

It'll be available for a week, and then it's gone like the band.

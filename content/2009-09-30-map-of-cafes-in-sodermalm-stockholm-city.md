From some of the "open data" available on the Intarnets I've created the following Google Map that shows where cafés in the southern part of Stockholm city are to be found. There's even an RSS-feed [here](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&msa=0&output=georss&msid=111332954436927961808.000474c579a139e12fd4b) for following changes made to the map. Some of the cafés are parts of chains (e.g. Wayne's Coffee and Coffeehouse by George) and most are not.

Any additions to this list would be appreciated in the comments section!

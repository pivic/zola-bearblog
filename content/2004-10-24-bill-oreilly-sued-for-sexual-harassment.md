Even though Fox networks will probably pump in as much money as is available in trying to free O'Reilly, the victim must have something up her sleeve as I guess she's going to have to beat him with more than just words.

Of course, as Bill O'Reilly never has any use for facts and/or truth in his life, the victim shouldn't. Right? He's a christian. An eye for an eye, I say! Aye!

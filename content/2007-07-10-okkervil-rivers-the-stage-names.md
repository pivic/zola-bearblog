![The Stage Names](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-07-10-thestagenames.png)Yes, this is a blatant plug, but it's for an important album. It's time to send your love to Will Sheff by ordering Okkervil River's forthcoming album "[The Stage Names](http://www.jagjaguwar.com/onesheet.php?cat=JAG110)". Order quickly to get hold of the deluxe limited edition of the album, for one measly dollar more than the regular edition.

If you need a reason, download "[Our Life is Not a Movie or Maybe](http://www.scjag.com/mp3/jag/ourlifeisnot.mp3)", one of the tracks on the album, to show you just why you should invest a few American dollars on something _real_. Yeah, that song's totally legal to download. Or go [download some other song by Okkervil River](http://www.jound.com/okkervil/mp3.html) totally legit, just to get the picture.

X knows a lot more about this band than I do so check out her blog [on the matter](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/tag/music/okkervil-river-will-sheff/). I must say I first fell in love with the band's album "[Black Sheep Boy](http://www.jagjaguwar.com/onesheet.php?cat=JAG120)" and quite recently "[Don't Fall In Love With Everyone You See](http://www.jagjaguwar.com/onesheet.php?cat=JAG039)"; both display more about life, love, what's real, what's not and essentially what moves me more than most other bands express during their life-span.

**edit**: please check out [this sophisticated post](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2007/07/17/what-gives-this-mess-the-grace) by X on "The Stage Names" and more regarding Okkervil River.

**edit 2**: I've written [this piece](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1299) on what I think of the album.

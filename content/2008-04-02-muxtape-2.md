OK, so I've been consistent and have compiled a second muxtape. It's [here](http://pivic.muxtape.com)! Here's the rundown:

1\. **Marlena Shaw** - "Let's Wade In The Water"

Funky little number with attitude in the song, this is a simple, badly produced track that shines due to the song and melody. And what attitude! _Let's waaaaade_!

2\. **Doves** - "Here It Comes"

This isn't one of my fave tracks by this brilliant band, but it's cathartic in a special way. Hard to define for me.

3\. **New York Dolls** - "Personality Crisis"

Did I write "attitude" before? You best _believe_! This is the pack leader, baby, the one who turns your etch-a-sketch upside-down and dances while you're [shakabuku](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119229/quotes)'d. Get it while it's _hot_.

4\. **Okkervil River** - "A Glow"

This is one of the songs by one of the best bands I have ever heard, that's on par with The Smiths and The Beatles. To me, "_A Glow_" sums love, renewal, rebirth and truth. The next time I see Will Sheff I'll kidnap him and put him in a cupboard at home à¡ la [Jeffrey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer).

5\. **Elliott Smith** - "Bottle Up And Explode!"

This song means so much to me it's silly. I miss Elliott Smith incessantly, yet tracks like this one makes the hurt bearable. With lines like "_The last time you cried, who'd you think was inside?_", who can blame me?

6\. **Cilla Black** - "Alfie"

Penned by the ineffable duo Burt Bacharach (music) and Hal David (lyrics), Cilla Black's strong, articulate voce comes across like a cross between a pop-singer and an operatic one. The astounding, implicating lyrics tell Alfie to let his heart lead his way as he walks, and I love every second of this perfect marriage between melody, arrangement, orchestration, sound, lyrics and song.

7\. **Arctic Monkeys** - "Chun Li's Spinning Bird Kick"

This is a b-side for the band's smash-through debut single, "I Bet That You Look Good On The Dancefloor". Even though their b-sides are criminally overlooked, this one's great. The laughter, the frisky drone, the riff, the short hip-hop break in the middle...a true breath of fresh air.

8\. **Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds** - "Loverman"

Here's a harassment of a song. Sex, salvation and synthetics. It's Nick Cave, what did you expect? Blixa Bargeld's screaming on this track's harrowing.

9\. **Party Ben** - "Somebody Rock Me (The Killers vs. The Clash)"

I love the concept of mash-ups, but I generally find them bad; this is of The Killers' "Somebody Told Me" and The Clash's "Rock The Casbah", and I think it's definitely worth listening and dancing to.

10\. **Dusty Springfield** - "I Don't Want to Hear it Anymore"

Sorrow, lies, heartbreak. The Muscle Shoals strings lead Dusty's voice into audible depths of despair as she tells us of her lover who's seen with another girl. This is off her legendary album "_Dusty In Memphis_", which I implore you to purchase straightaway, especially [this version](http://www.rhino.com/store/productdetail.lasso?number=75580) where you'll get 14 worthwhile bonus tracks!

11\. **The Velvelettes** - "Needle in a Haystack"

To connect with the previous track; the line "_Findin' a good man is like looking for a needle in a haystack_" says everything about this one. It's snatched from the recently purchased-by-yours-truly box-set "_[One Kiss Can Lead To Another: Girl Group Sounds Lost & Found](http://www.rhino.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=74645)_" and is the opener.

12\. **Primal Scream** - "Jailbird (The Dust Brothers Remix)"

This is one of the best remixes I've ever heard, especially in comparison with [the original](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvzI9AqeIog). If you're wondering who The Dust Brothers are, this moniker was actually loaned by The Chemical Brothers before having to change their name to avoid getting sued by [the real Dust Brothers](http://www.dustbrothers.com). By the way, [the video for the remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4lxV2IefOI) is very strong. Boogie down!

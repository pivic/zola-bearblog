Line 6 has released a new guitar, the [Variax 300](http://www.line6.com/variax/index.html). It's a really sick piece of playing, as it contains 25 guitar sounds.

Yes, you heard me. Just like Line 6 built the [Pod_xt_](https://niklasblog.com/?p=265) that I bought a few months ago, this is a guitar which contains the sounds of 25 other guitars. You just change guitar sound by turning a knob. It's quite incredible, as I'm sure the price also is. I want it!

I think I'll go for a [FBV Shortboard](http://www.line6.com/productDetail.html?model=42) instead, to complement my Pod_xt_. I'm dreaming of emulating [John Squire](http://www.johnsquire.com)'s lush wah-wah flood in [The Stone Roses](http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk)' "[Elephant Stone](http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk/discography/singles/elephantstone.asp)". God, I have to start writing songs.

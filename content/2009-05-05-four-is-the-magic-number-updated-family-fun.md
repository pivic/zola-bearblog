Blixa's got a friend - Lotta has returned back to our lives! This Saturday, Jesper and Tove packed X and myself into Jesper's car and went to [Finsta](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=59.7365402%2C18.4954001&hl=en&z=11&ie=UTF8) where our breeder lives with her multitude of dogs, children and two cats. As circumstance has it, she's getting rid of her cats and asked X and me if we wanted to have Lotta for free. Naturally we said yes, and picked her up. Did I ever tell you sphynx cats are great to have around clothes because they never harm fabric?

I lie [more than Henry Rollins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxsTYceKqV0)! Now, uniting two cats is no easy matter. Well, it can be. And then it can at times not be. Today, a mere three days after they first met, things are blissful, at least in comparison with what first happened when we introduced Lotta:

Blixa started stalking Lotta everywhere, following her every move which pissed Lotta off to no end. She wanted solitude, but instead she ended up with Blixa trying to jump her while she was at the ladies'. But, as you can see, Lotta packs a mean punch:

Experience has taught me that when sphynx cats fight each-other, skin schlepps against skin and hence creates nasty, smacking sounds. This has been especially audible when Blixa's been pestering Lotta like mad for ages. She then gets a mean smack-down from her older sister, which means calmness for a while and then...Blixa repeats. At least, that's what things were like for the first day in its entirety; X and I didn't get much sleep. On Sunday the cats were able to eat from the same bowl - even though they have separate bowls - which was very nice to see. Yesterday they started calming down, and X told me that Lotta had been licking Blixa's behind. Success! ((We think.)) The night was quiet and calm, and all was well.

X shot this excellent film yesterday, showing Lotta's marvellous snake-cat hissing feature and Blixa's supernatural slow-mo kitteh moves:

What to say? They're magnificent and I love them. I'm pretty confident they'll become great friends quite soon. ((And it's safe to say they'll be making us breakfast every single morning for the rest of our lives.))

As [Jeremy Brett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy%20Brett) is of course, without a single doubt, the most singular Sherlock Holmes to ever appear in video, I'm hereby happy to show that you will be able to watch an entire episode of his portrayal of Holmes in one of the most legendary adventures as written by Watson Arthur Conan Doyle, serialised and produced through Granada Television in the 1980s. The episode is cut into six parts, which are found below in chronological order.

All the while, I would like to recommend Leslie Klinger's wonderful anthology called "[The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes](http://www.annotatedsherlockholmes.com/sherlock)", a collection of all stories written of Holmes and Watson, sprightly and informatively annotated.

I present to you, "The Speckled Band". You can find the tale in its full glory online, by clicking [here](http://www.literaturecollection.com/a/doyle/sherlock-holmes/8/).

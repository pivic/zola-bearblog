[![Gary Glitter vs young persons](http://static.flickr.com/47/142631558_3b74f6d12c_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=142631558)When rummaging through [Bj√∂rg](http://static.flickr.com/47/128284232_b9087eb6dd.jpg "NME-stealer.")'s old NME's this Saturday, I found this little ad dating back to 1988. Considering [the insurmountable irony](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/517604.stm), I'm sorry, but that naughty look just turns twisted and fucking evil. What a rotter.

The evil side of me was tempted to Photoshop "HYDRA +" into "DP CREAM" but I'm too graceful to even suggest I'd have done that...

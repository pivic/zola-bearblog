[![Wholegrain spaghetti with fried shrimp](http://static.flickr.com/86/243301316_adc5c37177_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=243301316) My newly acquired first two deluxe edition-releases of some olde Pulp-albums, namely "[His 'n' Hers: Deluxe Edition](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000GQLR46%26tag=niklasblog-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000GQLR46%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")" and "[This Is Hardcore: Deluxe Edition](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000GQLR4G%26tag=niklasblog-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000GQLR4G%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")" arrived yesterday. Mmm, good. I've just listened through HnH and it's good. Good. I've never been into it, but what the hell, this is a chance to hear it with older ears; when I first got Pulp (through some weird blast of "Babies", which I didn't actually recognise when I saw them live at the Lollipop festival in Stockholm, which my mate [Andreas](http://flickr.com/photos/andreasflodin) said "whattaell!" about) I hadn't heard the likes of Serge Gainsbourg, Scott Walker or Jacques Dutronc so I didn't know where they were coming from, neither did I care anything about the kitchen sink-way of writing tracks (more than the occational album by Blur) so now I'm seeing Jarvis' lyrics with, hopefully, brighter eyes. Older eyes, anyway.

Yesterday I met Mikaela and Björg in the centre of Stockholm city. They had been pillaging for new clothes, so when I found them they were carrying bags and salivating over buttons. Yeah, buttons for clobber. We went past [PUB](http://www.pub.se) where new men's clothes are quite interesting; I saw a nice jacket by Ben Sherman and a few shirts from Fred Perry, but other than that I wasn't too minded as I had my minds on getting to a rest-room as soon as possible.

Björg went home with us and had tea, food and cava. We watched "[24 Hour Party People](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000ECXWEA%26tag=niklasblog-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000ECXWEA%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")" and had a nice time. Before that though, Björg and I browsed a bunch of videos through YouTube, all are her picks except where mentioned:

Marc Almond & Gene Pitney - "[Something's Gotten Hold Of My Heart](http://youtube.com/watch?v=-ANBiC8RoZk)" - actually my choice, and it's great, even though Björg was more into Marc Almond's slightly

Elton John - "[This Train Don't Stop There Anymore](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lHx8f1Uabw)" - somehow I've missed this _brilliant_ video where effing Justin Timberlake does a great job impersonating Elton! Brilliant track as well.

["Pulp - This Is Hardcore"](http://youtube.com/watch?v=p-ELN6tVfjE) - brilliant video, fantastic track, and more superlatives abound when you purchase [Pulp - Anthology \[2002\]](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B00006LSI4%26tag=niklasblog-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B00006LSI4%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon"), which is really worth its money

Men Without Hats - "[Safety Dance](http://youtube.com/watch?v=7gILyoqSM_8)" - say no _more_

China Crisis - "[Wishful Thinking](http://youtube.com/watch?v=ww9r2AsCbaA)"

It's Immaterial - "[Driving Away From Home](http://youtube.com/watch?v=DjjKf8bVRD4)"

Cabaret Voltaire - "[Sensoria](http://youtube.com/watch?v=pBEj7T7WYM8)" - this is my choice, though, really good video from a band that helped put EBM on the map.

The Art Of Noise - "[Close (To The Edit)](http://youtube.com/watch?v=on8AChpwk30)" - my pick as well, one of the best videos, ever.

Blow Monkeys - "[Digging Your Scene](http://youtube.com/watch?v=JpMUHm2qhDY)" - I couldn't understand the clobber but Björg said she thought these guys were hot at the time. I didn't dare ask her if she still clung on to that perception.

Oh, apropos nothing, don't forget to [download Foxit Reader 2.0](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/reader_2/down_reader.htm), a lot faster than Adobe Reader and better overall, if you ask me.

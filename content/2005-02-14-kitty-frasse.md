Mikaela picked me up after work - and what a god-awful fucking work-day it's been - in the little golden bug, and swivelled away to Gullmarsplan, where Ã¥sa lives with her two kids and a little kitty, who happens to be Frasse.

[Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-02-14) are a few pictures of the kitty, which seems very content with life. The picture where it's lounging over a book is wonderful. I also love the films of it. [Here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-02-14-frasse1.mp4)'s \[600KB, MP4\] one, and [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-02-14-frasse2.mp4)'s \[750KB, MP4\] another one. The little furry one is full of energy, flying about the place. It's also very social, running about the place and craving to be petted. Or rather, that's what I want it to think.

Now it's time to go to bed early. Tomorrow I'll handle the emergency phone as I've swapped my regular Thursday. I'm so tired of work right now, that just thinking of it makes my head dwindle. It's not that it's crap as in "oh-my-job's-crap", I like it - it's just that there's too much to do right now. Maybe we should have made the server transition database-by-database rather than to have moved all of them at once. Anyway, it's a bit late for thinking that now, so here's to next time. Good-night!

As I'm thinking about purchasing [MacBook](http://apple.com/macbook), the latest laptop from [Apple](http://apple.com), I came across [this post](http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/06/01/why-im-more-productive-on-a-mac) on how the author has reached a high degree of productivity using OSX, the operating system on Macs.

The little I've seen and tried of running [OSX](http://apple.com/macosx), makes me love [Expos√©](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose), [Spotlight](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight) and [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com). [Automator](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator) seems very loveable as well.

These features aren't even remotely available on Windows today.

Windows Vista tries to steal some, such as [gadgets](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/features/foreveryone/sidebar.mspx) on the Vista Sideboard (the OSX-equivalent of [widgets](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard) running in the OSX Dashboard (which Apple actually stole from Konfabulator, which today is [Yahoo! Widget Engine](http://widgets.yahoo.com)) and [Instant Search](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/features/foreveryone/searchorg.mspx#more) which is moving close to OSX's [Spotlight](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight). The nearest sensible alternative I have found to Spotlight is [Beagle](http://beaglewiki.org/Main_Page) for Linux.

If you want to see some screen-casts on how Windows Vista works, there are a bunch of them available [here](http://duggmirror.com/software/Windows_Vista_Screencasts).

Besides, MacBook runs [Bootcamp](http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp), a free program from Apple, that allows a user to dual-boot a Mac into Windows. [Even using Windows Vista](http://www.tuaw.com/2006/06/08/an-easier-method-to-get-windows-vista-to-run-with-boot-camp).

[This](http://blog.wired.com/cultofmac/index.blog?entry_id=1501430) is sad though; it looks as if some users experience problems using the white MacBook as the housing discolours to orange. Weird! Apple hasn't said anything yet; mind you, this has happened after a few weeks of use. Fugly.

By the way, I visited [Humac](http://www.humac.se) today. I asked the nearest clerk two questions, to which I received two interesting answers.

Q: Do you have any sleeves available for MacBook? A: There aren't any available. Q: Do you know when you will carry MacBook in stock again? A: Who knows?

Horrid service. To top that off, there [are](http://www.foofpod.com) actually sleeves available for the MacBook - even if most of them are just starting to ship. I loathe bad service.

**edit**: now that I've actually bought a MacBook, check [this post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1001) out.

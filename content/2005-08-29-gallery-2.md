I've just installed and upgraded [Gallery 2](http://gallery.menalto.com) (RC-2), so please try [my version](https://niklasblog.com/gallery2) out and tell me what you think of it. Any thoughts? What's good and what's bad?

Well, if you ask me, I like the new gallery the most of all I've tried. It lacks the simplicity of BananAlbum, but is a wholly different experience. As a user, you can search for pictures tagged with search-words. You can click through which pictures you want to download and get them all bundled as a ZIP-file. The gallery enables you to view albums as slide-shows, using a full-screen feature where you navigate through the pictures using the arrow-buttons on your keyboard. You can even see pictures in different sizes, just like [flickr](http://www.flickr.com) does.

As an administrator, there are a few very easy ways to upload pictures, sort them into galleries and tag them quickly. One can add themes, modules (i.e. plug-ins), and administrate available albums easy. There's even the possibility to let users register themselves.

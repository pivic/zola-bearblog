He died yesterday merely 41 years old, following the battles with two strokes. This means a g-funk icon is gone.

Don't forget him. While his backup singing ruled for - among others - Dr. Dre and Snoop, his own work also had quite some power, especially the album "[Music & Me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_Me_(Nate_Dogg_album))".

And yes, let's not forget a couple of key songs he backed up.

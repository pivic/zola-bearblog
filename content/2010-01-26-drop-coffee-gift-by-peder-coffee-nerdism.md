Peder has been to Tokyo, and hence I got this unexpected great dose of Japan when I got to [Drop Coffee](http://dropcoffee.blogspot.com):

How freaking thoughtful! That DJ'ing kitty will look great on the netbook cover. I've been looking for cool stickers for laptops, so if you have any tips let me have it.

Speaking of Drop Coffee, if you live in Stockholm and get the chance this week, don't hesitate to try Ã¥re Kafferosteri's "Rwanda", a very round, dark and soft coffee, perfect for cupping. Erik's the man for setting this up!

Speaking of which, this is just too much. But I've gotta post it. Coffee nerdism.

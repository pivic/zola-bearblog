As I was leaving the subway yesterday to say hi to [Drop Coffee](http://dropcoffee.se) and buy some of their product, I came across a karaoke busker who sang [Morrissey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey)'s "_[Everyday Is Like Sunday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyday%20Is%20Like%20Sunday)_" and even played a live saxophone solo to it.

So I had to shoot this. And tip him.

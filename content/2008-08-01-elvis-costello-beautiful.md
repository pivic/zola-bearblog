Yeah, it's a cover of Christina Aguilera's song, and who deemed to do it better than music-snob Elvis Costello? He slowed it down and made it more electronic than his usual stuff. I think this is Aguilera's best track ever. A nice way to kick off the weekend!

Here you go, and the track will be history after a week.

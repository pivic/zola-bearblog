Yesterday was very calm. X and I watched "[Cidade de Deus](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317248)", which was a lot better than I expected - and I had very high expectations; the direction, the acting, the cinematography, the sheer consistency and story-telling was very high. I'll give it 8/10. I strongly recommend it. Prejudiced, I thought it'd be about violence and the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, but that's just sheer lack of truth; it lucidly follows a boy and the people around him as they grow up, mature and/or disintegrate. The film conveyed the sense of urgency in the shape of crime that I have learned of through international media, by using humor much in the same way that [Bill Hicks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hicks) did to show how the American government was corrupt and filled with terrorists. I'm looking forward to seeing "[Tropa de Elite](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0861739)", which is supposed to be a follow-up of sorts. By the way, the Brazilian government has [recently claimed](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/15/brazil-drugs-trade) that it has cleared out all criminal elements from the City of God. I'm _sure_ that isn't just an unintended euphemism to say that the criminal elements have merely moved a few feet outside them city limits...

Late in the evening we saw "[Eyes Wide Shut](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120663)", the last film that Stanley Kubrick made. Seeing it for the second time in appx. seven years was highly interesting; I interpreted the relationship between the Harford couple (Nicole Kidman/Tom Cruise) with more depth than before, along with Kubrick's use of light, colours and signature photography. Thanks to "The Stanley Kubrick Archives" I've read a lot about the film. Kubrick was really a master director. His use of colours particularly grabs me, as if transcended from his other works, in my mind from when he started shooting in colour. I love how he tastefully uses works from his family in the film, as well as how extremely meticulous he was; instead of filming in New York, a replica of a couple of New York blocks were built in Pinewood Studios, England. Almost all indoor shots were very under-exposed and "lit up" using a process of force-developing the film during post-production, i.e. letting the film sog for a longer time in bath than it usually did. Kubrick wanted two people who were a couple in real life to play the main characters. He wrote open-ended contracts with Kidman/Cruise, meaning that they were to work on the project for as long as Kubrick wanted them to. The music was picked by Kubrick, as usual. Everything in the film has a dreamy quality, and I think Kidman shines while Cruise is woody, as usual. I like dreamy films. I long to see "[L'Avventura](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053619)" again.

This morning X and I talked about Salvador Dalà­. I thought of the dream sequence he made for Alfred Hitchcock's "[Spellbound](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038109)":

I then came to think of the video for Cypress Hill's "Illusions", which culls mentioned scene ((Not to mention the introduction scene from Francis Ford Coppola's "[Apocalypse Now](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788)".)):

During his inauguration speech, Barack Obama promised to "restore science to its rightful place". Today, he has indeed proved that he's about to back those words up. From [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/jan/23/stem-cell-trial-go-ahead):

> The world's first trial of embryonic stem cell technology on humans is billed to take place this year after the US government gave it the go-ahead today.

First announcing that [Guantà¡namo Bay will close](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-guantanmo_frijan23,0,3893533.story), then that all [the CIA ghost prisons around the globe will cease to exist](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jan/23/3) and now this. A promising start, surely!

Let's hope for more promising news. The following's a stroppy post that I did on Seesmic regarding this, and I'm hoping for a bunch of American comments on the matter, even though the entire planet will hopefully be affected and that [stem-cell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell) research will continue in a much larger scale.

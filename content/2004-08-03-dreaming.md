Last Night I Dreamt Of my being on a floating hostel, a boarding house, where I was with other passengers. The environment reminded me of Agatha Christie's "[Death On The Nile](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077413/combined)". When I awakened, all other passengers were on their way to the dining-room, where breakfast was served. The strange bit was us all standing around a very large brass serving-tray/cash register (yes, it served both purposes) with a man in the middle. He asked us all to write what we wanted "extra" apart from the rest of our morning meal. We could distinctly hear the bustle of people getting food from different trays et. c. in a room close-by, and I got hungry. As none of us standing in queue could see what was available to eat in the adjacent room, we could not make up our minds on what to have additionally. The service-person was adamant about the order, and asked us to write down what we wanted, on a piece of paper, stuck onto a flat, fat piece of cheese which served as surface.

The cheese immediately fattened the paper, and made writing near-impossible. I was one of the last to get the cheese protocol, and had to find new ways to write as the fat made the ink react, and just splurge all over the cheese. I remember the other people waiting to get to write their orders became very cross with me over this, but what the hell. I woke up.

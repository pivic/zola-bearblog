I've finally got myself a wireless router! I've been thinking about it, loaned [one](http://netgear.com/products/details/WGT624.php) from work, but thanks to Anos, I now know that there are some key issues with it; for instance, a lot of people have complained of being disconnected by it, forcing them to manually restart it by pulling the power-plug and re-inserting it. This has led some geekish, wonderful people to develop an open-source firmware for that router, which many claim has helped them to get rid of all their connection-troubles. When I found that out, I quickly jumped the boat on Netgear, got a Linksys router which [looks very freaky](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0006ZM4XK.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg "The robot from Lost in Space") but is very nice. After upgrading the firmware I got an extra security feature, and away I went. Love it so far. More info about it available through [the supplier's site](http://tinyurl.com/hy9bq). By the way, if you ever need help with setting up a router with port forwarding or triggers, check [PortForward](http://portforward.com), an excellent site.

In case you're wondering what [pangasius](http://www.answers.com/pangasius) is, it's a substitute for cod, much like [hoki](http://www.seafood.co.nz/business/fishaqua/species/hoki.asp), as cod is getting more scarce these days. Pangasius is a tasty fish, and together with a tomatoe-sauce containing chili (made mostly with strained tomatoes) and unpolished rice, it's great.

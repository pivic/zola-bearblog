I just woke up from a bizarre dream while in Flen.

I dreamt that I woke up and saw lights flickering in the hall-way of X's mom's house, where we're staying. I stood up and walked to the door-way.

I immediately saw Tomas, Ulrika's fianc√©, dressed as a ladybug, crawling up a wall. He was wearing skin-tight satin garb, painted as a ladybug. I then saw Blixa with hooves standing on her hind legs (just as she did in my previous dream) carrying a tiny pitchfork. She looked very scared.

And then Ulrika herself, entering the hall-way from the kitchen, carrying a big pitchfork, dressed like Satan, in skin-tight satin garb. She was very angry, but I've no idea why.

There you go. What to make of it?

[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-10-anosthumb.gif)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-10-anos.jpg)Kalle, a work-mate, usually asks me for chocolates whenever I've been to Pappa Ray Ray, where they give you little bits of it whenever you order an espresso. I don't eat it, so I give it away. The last time I was there, I went with Anos, who ate my chocolate. When I came back to work, Kalle asked me where the chocolate was \[...\] and I surly answered that Anos had eaten them.

K: What? Who's he to eat **my** chocolate? Me: You bastard! It's **mine**! K: Well, tell Anos I'll get him yet!

So today Anos and I went to Pappa Ray Ray and fixed that photo, MMS'ing it to Kalle after Anos had added a brutal "HA HA HAA" sound-clip. As Kalle's technically challenged, he still hadn't opened the MMS after I arrived back at work, so I watched him open it, full volume. "HA HA HAA" and [that face](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-10-anos.jpg). Kalle swore he'd think of a revenge. I'm sure Anos is shaking in his boots.

Speaking of faces, Robin (another colleague) [added one himself](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-10-robin.jpg) trying to out-do Anos.

Damn it! I'm not that good.

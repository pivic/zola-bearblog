I've been working! An electric whirlwind, finally letting go. Still, I'm happy. It's matter of not getting too stressed.

And now I'm on my way home and I'm listening to Patti's "_Horses_" and I'm really lovin' it and there's a brisk, lukewarm wind tugging at my hair. I just finished Chuck Palahniuk's "_Snuff_" and I'm happy for having read it; it was really funny and made me want to puke at the same time. Loads of little stories rolled into one, plus one-liners.

Tonight belongs to X and me.

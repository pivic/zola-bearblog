I've been tipped of a few interesting tracks by some very interesting artists of late.

![2007-03-15-grinderman2.jpg](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-03-15-grinderman2.jpg)[Grinderman](http://www.grinderman.com) is Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds minus four people, churning out angry, grinding tracks which are quite influenced (lyrically) by early blues, (musically) [The Jesus & Mary Chain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_and_Mary_Chain) and [Ramones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ramones). They've got knives to sharpen and primal urges to keep close to heart.

**Grinderman** - "Get It On":

[Shitdisco](http://www.shitdisco.co.uk) is a lot like [Klaxons](http://www.klaxons.net) even though they're more interesting, methinks. When I listen to them, I think of [Bruno](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/graphics/2004/08/11/bvborat199.jpg) saying _Give me energy, more energy!_ Simple, has been done before, but they churn out good tunes.

**Shitdisco** - "Lover Of Others":

![2007-03-15-mrk1.jpg](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-03-15-mrk1.jpg)I've been looking for tough, dirty grime ((Yes, I am aware those two words make out [tautology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_%28rhetoric%29).)) everywhere but haven't been able to find anything interesting enough. I find [Dizzee Rascal](http://www.dizzeerascal.co.uk) too ADD for me, [The Mitchell Brothers](http://www.themitchellbrothers.co.uk) nice but not interesting enough to hold for several plays, so guess what I thought when finding MRK1's "Copyright Laws", an album that combines grime with electronic slow-beats and ragga, making me recall [Leftfield](http://www.leftfield-online.co.uk) in the very best sense? I like the slow beats, the delay, echoes, most melodies plus the guest vocals. Very nice indeed. A copy of that album plopped through my mailslot today.

Buy MRK1's "Copyright Laws" [here](http://www.dotshop.se/ds/browse.php?aid=2089).

**MRK1** - "Ruler"

While MRK1 may sound like an electronic bodily jungle, Distance reeks of "[Blade Runner](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658)"; this is a clinically composed album along the veins of Johnny L's precise drum 'n' bass, is well produced and grows on you and reminds me of Portishead at times, until the polyrhythms kick in.

Buy Distance's "My Demons" [here](http://www.dotshop.se/ds/browse.php?aid=2089) - even though it's currently out of stock.

**Distance** - "Night Vision"

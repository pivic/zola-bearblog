[![Pistachio nuts](http://static.flickr.com/47/116024415_f3eb91afeb_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=116024415) Too cool! Tamara's boyfriend, Peter, has written a book that's just out. Dagens Nyheter has published [this review](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1352&a=530620&previousRenderType=6), where they applaud him. The book is titelled "Pol Pots leende. Om en svensk resa genom RÃ¶da khmerernas Kambodja" (which roughly translates as "Pol Pot's Smile: On a Swede's trip through Cambodia of the [Khmer Rouge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge)") and is available [here](http://www.exlibris.se/product.aspx?ISBN=9173892041).

I love it when people are open, like Roger Ebert where [he writes that he cannot understand how "Crash" won the Oscar for "best picture", over "Brokeback Mountain"](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060307/LETTERS/60307019). Read that column. Ebert says what he thinks - and I cannot praise him enough for doing that. Unlike [Apple, where people are fired for reading poetry](http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/19/apple-employee-gets-fired-for-hilarious-standup-poetry-routine/), when they're asked to do so.

[Here](http://searchopensource.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid39_gci1174145,00.html)'s a little interesting article on how [OpenOffice](http://openoffice.org) compares with [MS Office](http://microsoft.com/office).

> "I usually finish my homework at school," he explains to a visitor, "but if not, I pop a book open on my lap in my room, and while the computer is loading, I'll do a problem or write a sentence. Then, while mail is loading, I do more. I get it done a little bit at a time."

> "You just multitask," she explains. "My parents always tell me I can't do homework while listening to music, but they don't understand that it helps me concentrate."

This is a quote from [this article](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060320-6417.html), courtesy of Ars Technica, on [techno-stress](http://www.aia.org/ep2_template.cfm?pagename=yaf_n_technostress) and what perennial multi-tasking does to people. Interesting. I felt it.

I just ordered [this t-shirt](http://www.threadless.com/product/114/Flowers_in_the_Attic) as threadless had a sale.

If you feel you would like to know more on what "web 2.0" is, read [this terrific article](http://www.webmonkey.com/06/12/index4a.html) that deals with the subject effortlessly.

What better way to end a collection of links with [a freaky cat](http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2006/03/20/news/californian/31906192121.txt)?

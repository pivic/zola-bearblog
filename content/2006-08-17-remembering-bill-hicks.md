Yes, I have been a fan of Bill Hicks for quite some time, and I love his work. I love it when people [acknowledge The Dark Poet](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/edinburgh2006/story/0,,1851914,00.html).

If you have never experienced him, read up, and go purchase "[Rant in E-Minor](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000009QI/niklasblog-20)" and "[Revelations](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/INSERT_ASIN_HERE/niklasblog-20)" now.

For those of you who have been around the block, I strongly recommend a great biography on Bill called "[American Scream](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380803771/niklasblog-20)" and a new book (which I have admittedly not read) called "[What Would Bill Hicks Say?](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1933368012/niklasblog-20)" where his close compadres and the likes of Thom Yorke talk about Bill.

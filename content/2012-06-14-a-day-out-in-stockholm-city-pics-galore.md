The day took off with continually swapping a colleague's background image on his computer. Of course, that's what you get when you won't lock the screen. This background is [Helena Bergström](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5466), who is the most overrated actor in Sweden - bonus: she's married to the most overrated director in Sweden.

Hötorget, where street-peddlers hawked gear. Not Trainspotting-type gear.

The view from Hötorget towards Sergels Torg. Note the little man in the bottom left side of the screen. He's being a human billboard, which is something that popped up about 15 years ago and hasn't left Sweden since.

Statues at Hötorget.

Inside the cinema at SF Sergel, where "Prometheus" was about to start.

Met Zak and his dad Graham afterwards.

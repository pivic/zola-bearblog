Sony still has problems with answering why they've included a [rootkit](http://www.answers.com/rootkit), that's implanted in a bunch of their new CD's (and is installed when you load one of these into a computer running MS Windows, where [autorun](http://www.answers.com/autorun) is enabled). Obviously Sony doesn't want anybody to copy their CD's, but this way of preventing people from doing that is just stupid. By the way, it seems you can copy these CD's anyway, using [EAC](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de), a freeware audio-copying tool and holding a Shift-key pressed while loading the CD (which is how you temporarily disable the autorun feature on a Windows operating-system).

EFF is fighting a just cause about this problem, so check their very easy-to-understand information about this right [here](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004144.php). My fave bit: if you want to uninstall this rootkit, your computer may hate you by [blue-screening](http://www.answers.com/blue+screen+of+death). Check more about that [here](http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/11/more-on-sony-dangerous-decloaking.html).

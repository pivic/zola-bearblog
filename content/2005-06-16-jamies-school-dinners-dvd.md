Now's your chance to get Oliver's "[Jamie's School Dinners](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00099BISK)" on DVD. It's just been released, and is one of very few TV-series I've enjoyed of late, apart from the second series of "[Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares](http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/R/realdeal/ramsay)", which is blissful in a different way. While Oliver comes across as a somewhat haphazard gentleman with great love for food, Ramsay gives a face to the psychopathic head-chef with a veneer of bliss; and a great love for food, in an extremely perfectionistic sense. Watching those two series has cemented what's good about food TV, mostly; they're people who carry an urgent passion for great foods consisting of great produce, made in great ways.

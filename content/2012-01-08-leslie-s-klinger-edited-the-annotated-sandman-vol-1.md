[![The Annotated Sandman, vol. 1](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2012-01-08-sandman.jpg "The Annotated Sandman, vol. 1")](https://niklasblog.com/?attachment_id=9616)

I feel like I'm sinking into literary oblivion, but thanks to [a blog post by Neil Gaiman](http://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/1916002-on-new-year-s-eve-where-i-am), I've just discovered that his [**The Sandman** epic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_%28Vertigo%29) is being published in annotated format, which is done by none other than [Leslie S. Klinger](http://lesliesklinger.com).

He's the guy who annotated [Arthur Conan Doyle](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2448.Arthur_Conan_Doyle)'s canon of Sherlock Holmes-stories, both [volumes 1 and 2](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3582.The_New_Annotated_Sherlock_Holmes), and [volume 3](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3583.The_New_Annotated_Sherlock_Holmes_Volume_III).

Why buy when I've already got the graphic novels?

Simply put: to delve further into the Sandman world, which is so fleshed-out by the geeky fable-dweller that Gaiman is. I think I'll discover angles and actually get to know more than what I bargained for when ordering this thing.

Click [here](http://www.tor.com/stories/2011/12/the-annotated-sandman-vol-1-excerpt) to see previews of what the first volume looks like; with all that goes along with 560 pages and 2.5 kilograms it's bound to make a whopping sound when it hits the floor at home.

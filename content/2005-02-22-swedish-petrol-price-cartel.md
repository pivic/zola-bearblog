The five biggest, domineering, petrol companies in Sweden have now been found guilty of having formed an illegal cartel to keep petrol prices up. They're collectively paying 112 million crowns (16 million USD), and won't have to pay for the cost of the trial.

112 million crowns! That's a drop in the ocean for these companies! Slack-jawed bitches. They should be publicly flogged for this. More on this from DN, [here](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=145&a=382217) \[in Swedish\].

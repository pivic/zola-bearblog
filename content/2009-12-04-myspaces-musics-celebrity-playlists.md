As MySpace are relaunching their music site, they're doing this by letting some celebs give up their playlists. You'll find them all [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/dec/03/myspace-music-celebrity-playlists). A lot picked out Jay-Z'a ““ "_Empire State Of Mind_" which felt...calculated. Now, who cares about what "The Vatican" picks? 2Pac? Three cheers for calculations. And R. Kelly selecting Fall Out Boy? Woo. Kings of Leon also feels like a blighted pick.

Now, Lady Gaga picking Faith No More and Elton John though is just sweet, but Britney picking both Elton's "_Tiny Dancer_" and Journey's "_Don't Stop Believin'_" is just cool beyond comparison. Florence and The Machine picked my 2nd fave Madonna track (the first one - of course - being "_Cherish_", beyond all) not to mention "Crazy In Love" and that ole Dusty track that features in "_[Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120735)_".

Here are my faves:

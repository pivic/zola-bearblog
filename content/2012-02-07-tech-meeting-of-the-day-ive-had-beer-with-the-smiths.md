A person talks to me at work, requiring assistance.

**User**: Oh, hi!

He points at [a poster of The Smiths](http://www.chrisasquith.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/The-Smiths-Salford-Club-Poster-C10026936.jpg) that I've got up on an office wall.

**U**: Your poster? **Niklas**: Oh, yes! **U**: Great band! I've had beers with The Smiths. Morrissey, I've had beer with him.

What. The. Hell?

**U**: I'm from Manchester, actually. Salford.

Imagine that! What a nice encounter. And he was really nice, too.

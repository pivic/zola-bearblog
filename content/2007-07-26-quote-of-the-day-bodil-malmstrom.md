[From her blog](http://www.finistere.se/blogg/entry.asp?ENTRY_ID=823):

> Om det är något som är tråkigare än personer som berättar sina drömmar så är det personer som berättar om sina dataproblem.

Translates to:

> If there is something more boring than people talking abour their dreams, it's people talking about their computer problems.

And I'm one of those people who get paid to listen to just that, people talking about their computer problems. And I almost feel lovingly slighted by it, if it weren't for the fact that the pay-check for this month just dropped. Thank heavens for small mercies.

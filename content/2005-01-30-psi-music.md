[Here](http://www.blacktable.com/mayle050126.htm)'s an interesting article from The Black Table on music that has predicted the future in unintended ways. So very CSI. PSI. ESP. Nintendo DS. Whateva! Excerpts:

> **Explosions in the Sky** released its album on September 10, 2001 and the next day, on September 11th, the skyline above Manhattan exploded in fire as Islamic terrorists crashed airplanes into the World Trade Center. Not only did the band's name prefigure the attacks, but so did the album's elegiac art work of angels tracing empyrean paths to a fiery orange heaven. And the creepiest detail of all is that the record had a track that was titled, unbelievably, "This Plane Will Crash Tomorrow," which was subsequently removed from the album.

> 50-Foot Wave wasn't alone in its suddenly inappropriate band name. **Tsunami Bomb** \[...\]

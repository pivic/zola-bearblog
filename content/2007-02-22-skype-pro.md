I've recently subscribed to [Skype Pro](http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2007/02/skype_pro_launches_today.html). It cost me 115SKR (~16USD) including VAT, which gives me a membership valid for five months; after that, it's â‚¬2/month. So, what does this grant me?

**1**. I can call landlines in a bunch of countries for [0.45SKR/call](http://www.skype.com/products/skypeout/rates/connection_fee.html) (~0.06USD). **2**. I get free [Skype Voicemail](http://www.skype.com/products/skypevoicemail). **3**. â‚¬5 worth of SkypeOut credit

Apparently, I should be able to get a few credits as a Skype Pro user, but no way - I just tried to install an exclusive ring-tone but I just got an error-message. Drab.

Anyway, calling nearly for free is cool.

**edit**: speaking of the devil, [Skype 3.1 (beta)](http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2007/02/skype_31_beta_for_windows_skyp.html) has just been released, and contains a number of nifty stuff. Too bad using it to search for "restaurant" in the whole of Stockholm town brings no hits. I've added two cafés now...making them the first in Stockholm. Well, still, it can be a good community-thing. Check it out!

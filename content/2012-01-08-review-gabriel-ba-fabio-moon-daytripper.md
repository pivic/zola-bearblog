[![Daytripper](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1308957619m/8477057.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8477057)[Daytripper](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8477057) by [Gabriel Bà¡](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/313357) and Fabio Moon  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/246886402)  
  
This is a fine example of a one-volume, quite independently driven piece of graphic novel, written and inked by two Brazilian brothers who reiterate the stories of lives going on and re-on, and I shan't say too much about the gist of this as you'll just have to read it yourself to have the magic unfurl, as it were.

It focuses on a character from the start of his life, and goes on. It stops, and goes on. And so on. Oh, the Humanity.

It's much more than that, and while I'd like to go in-depth on it, it would spoil the entire thing even though I think it wouldn't be spoiled if you heard it.

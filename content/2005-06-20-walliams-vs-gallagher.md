[David Walliams](http://www.davidwalliams.com/LittleBritain.htm) \[sic\] off [Little Britain](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/tv/littlebritain/index.shtml) interviews [Noel Gallagher](http://www.oasisinet.com/site.php) for the latest monthly issue of [The Observer](http://observer.guardian.co.uk) . Too bad the interview in its entirety isn't available on the internet, but snippets are. It's fun to see that [Noel mocks Bob Geldof's beloved G8](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1509787,00.html) concerts that are to take place in the name of poverty, and likewise to see old photographer [David Bailey mock Oasis](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,13887,1506396,00.html) plus there's [info on how to write an Oasis song](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/observer/archives/2005/06/17/how_to_write_an_oasis_song.html#more) (even though they're shite these days).

My absolute fave electronic artist of the past year or so is releasing his debut album, "**Total**", on May 30th on [Ed Banger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed%20Banger%20Records) records.

His music makes me explode much like that of Lightning Bolt, Okkervil River, The Smiths and Einstürzende Neubauten. Ed Banger indicates that his album won't be as full-on as his remixes and singles so far, though, but darker and slower.

The album cover is shot by [Jean-Baptiste Mondino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste%20Mondino):

Yes, that's SebastiAn himself. Twice.

I can't say how much I've waited for this album. His soundtrack for "[Notre Jour Viendra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre%20Jour%20Viendra%20OST)" is brilliant as are his singles, the "_[Motor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBDlP6djmuw)_" EP.

The album features appearances by M.I.A., Justice's Gaspard Augé, and Mayer Hawthorne.

The first single, "_Embody_", is out on 2011-04-04 and will be remixed by DJ Premier and Kavinsky.

> Did you know Daft Punk said he delivered the best remix they ever had for "_Human after all_"?

Here's that remix:

  

I must say I'm not too glad about "_Embody_", the first single off the album:

...but the x-rated (don't watch the video, just listen) soundbite of what I'm guessing is the track "_Total_" is brilliant!

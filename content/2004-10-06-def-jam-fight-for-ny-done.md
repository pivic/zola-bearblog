I got myself [Def Jam: Fight for NY](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/920171.asp) recently, where one uses brutal force to kick the life out of rappers, dancers and a few b-actors from fight films. Among them I met [Fat Joe](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-10-06-fatjoe.jpg), who is shaped like a walrus, [Sean Paul](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-10-06-seanpaul.jpg), who I really liked to beat the living daylights out of, [I battled with Ice-T against fools](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-10-06-icetmore.jpg), easily kicked [Slick Rick](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-10-06-slickrick.jpg) and was tormented by [Flavor Flav](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-10-06-flava.jpg), whom it took a while to get rid of.

All in all this game isn't worth buying if you're not into senseless violence at a very low level. Sure, it's fun, which is why I played it through (although the maniac in me made me play it entirely) but then again the story is extremely thin, it's full of product placement and by this I really mean it, worse than in the film "[I, Robot](http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=i_robot)".

So now I'll concentrate fully on [Katamari Damacy](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/918766.asp) and [NBA Live 2005](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/920477.asp)!

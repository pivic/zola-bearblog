A couple of days ago, Dagens Nyheter (hereby referred to as "DN"), the biggest Swedish morning-paper, reported of a "racket" in Ronna, a little town in Södertälje. According to an article by Anders Hellberg, journalist at DN, the people who started the racket were "invandrarungdomar", which is Swedish meaning "immigrant youths". I will post a link to said article later, and you will see why I'm not posting it right here.

I immediately wrote an e-mail to Mr. Hellberg, asking exactly how he knew that the persons who were responsible for said racket were immigrants. I also wondered _why_ DN had stated said youths were immigrants; what's important enough about that to write it? The plot thickens. Appx. 17 hours later, Mr. Hellberg had written an e-mail, saying he with it addresses every person who had written him about said article.

He starts his e-mail by stating that "appx. half the people" who had written him regarding said article had stated that they thought DN shouldn't write that the youths involved were "immigrant youths"; he continues by writing that "the other half" had written him and asked which nationalities were involved in the rackets. I wasn't part of either halves, mind you! He continues: "One can hardly question the fact that immigrant youths were behind the rackets. I was on-site at Ronna and the situation was obvious to every person. Of course one can try to keep the fact that immigrant youths were involved a secret, but in this case it borders on the ridiculous. Far too much in the text \[i.e. the article -Niklas\] would still clearly point in that direction: everybody knows that Ronna is a city where many immigrants live, the start of the racket where boys had yelled 'whore' at a young girl, the boys who yelled 'fascists' at the police. Of course, we can even hide this, but if we did, DN would be on a dangerous path. Attempts to retouch Stalin \[out of pictures, during his reign, I guess -Niklas\] are usually revealed and the punishment is grim."

This is a very interesting answer. Mr. Hellberg ends his e-mail by writing the following: "This discussion has now ended, on my behalf."

Ended, eh? Don't you think it's interesting that Mr. Hellberg writes that "immigrant youths" were "behind the rackets", while stating that "attempts to retouch Stalin are usually revealed and the punishment is grim", and also not answering my question?

I immediately e-mailed Mr. Hellberg, and sent copies of the e-mail to Jan Wifstrand and the ombudsman at DN. In my e-mail I publicly asked Mr. Hellberg exactly how he found out that all the persons involved in the rackets were immigrants, and also asked how he possibly could know this, unless he had seen their passports and/or asked all persons involved what their nationality (assuming they've then told him the truth) was at the time. I added that DN most certainly was on a dangerous path, if what Mr. Hellberg wrote was to be accepted as facts, should he be unable to back them up.

One day later, I have not received a single response from anybody at DN. A very interesting fact: the URL to said article on the site of DN has changed wholly; it no longer points to said article by Anders Hellberg, but to another one by somebody called Ulrika By. I have never before seen an URL at DN get diverted. The contents of the new article notes police-abuse, which is very different from the contents of Mr. Hellberg's article. The term "invandrarungdomar" is not found in this article. I have tried to find another article by Anders Hellberg about the rackets in Ronna, but haven't been able to. [Here](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=145&a=460934)'s the URL to the article I first read.

I have posted the entire e-mail-conversation as a comment to this post. It's entirely in Swedish. The reason to why Mr. Hellberg's reply looks distorted, is because he e-mailed his repartee using a most obscure character encoding.

Should I receive any replies from DN regarding this, I will post them in the comments. I really hope they do reply, for their own sake.

You may ask yourself why I'm commenting an article that has now been removed. The reasons are simple:

**1**. DN allows an article, using a hostile language (which might even be illegal, should DN not be able to provide solid evidence that they've acquired this knowledge as fact, but as prejudice) which is directed at a group of people, to be published. Articles like these should not be printed in any paper. **2**. The author of said article, Mr. Hellberg, cites Stalin and ends a discussion (on his behalf) by stating that "One can hardly question the fact that immigrant youths were behind the rackets." when he seems unable to provide evidence to back his "facts" with. **3**. Neither whom I have addressed about this problem, i.e. the author of the article, Mr. Wifstrand, and the Ombudsman at DN, have (so far) replied to my e-mail. The original article has now been removed, with the URL pointing at an entirely different one.

Credibility, anybody?

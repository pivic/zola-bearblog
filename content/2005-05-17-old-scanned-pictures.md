[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-05-14-morfarsmorthumb.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-05-14-morfarsmor.jpg)A few years ago, I rummaged through a lot of old photos while at my parents' house. Among them I found a buckload of pictures of mom! Also, I found a lot of her mom, my grandfather, and the woman on that picture is none other than Hanna, my grandfather's mother. That photo is nearly a hundred years old.

I've got to lend more pictures off my mom and scan them all. One day they're going to deteriorate and that'll be the end of them, but I'll make sure they're scanned before that!

By the way, Hanna looks cool as hell. I have to ask my grandmother about her.

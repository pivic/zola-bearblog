[I had my hair cut](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-09-14-hair.jpg) by miss Nicola Dunne today again, like the last time, but she kept the body of hair fairly long in order to do something more with it. The fringe is still very short, and I really like this hair-cut. The back is almost S-shaped, so the whole thing is like [Joe Strummer](http://www.classic-rock.be/IMG/jpg/strummer10.jpg) at his most punkish, mixed with a [moomin troll](http://www.kagin.co.jp/mobile/i-mode/img/moomin_1.gif).

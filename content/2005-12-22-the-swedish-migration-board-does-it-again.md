A couple of days ago I wrote [this post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=836) on how Dagens Nyheter revealed that a lot of employees of a department at [The Swedish Migration Board](http://www.migrationsverket.se) (actually 19 out of 21 employees working that day) drank champagne to celebrate the fact that they ejected a family from Sweden; a family that was seeking to live permanently in Sweden.

Yesterday, Dagens Nyheter revealed another very important fact. They published [this article](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=147&a=506254&previousRenderType=6) \[in Swedish\], the contents of which I will examine below.

At 2004-03-04 [Liz Sandgren](liz.sandgren@migrationsverket.se), Department Manager at The Swedish Migration Board, the Kristianstad chapter, sent an e-mail to (at least) 16 of her colleagues, where she asked them to partake in celebrating the fact that a "troublesome" woman had been denied a permanent stay in Sweden and had been sent to her "homeland". Here's a translation of the letter, which is available [here](http://www.dn.se/content/1/c6/50/62/54/migmejl463.jpg); yet again, observe that most lingual errors are due to the original author:

> subject: AP 2005 and cake! body: Hello ! Yesterday persons X Y and Z carried out our troublesome woman in à–stra Göinge. We celebrate with cake and at the same time wish her and her children all the best in their homeland!
> 
> NB Tomorrow I want that you have printed and brought each of your copies of regional Activity Plan 2004.
> 
> Sincerely, Liz

According to Dagens Nyheter, approximately 15 employees partook in celebrating that The Swedish Migration Board, i.e. themselves, had ejected a woman and her three children from stay in Sweden.

When Dagens Nyheter called Liz Sandgren, asking for comments on this celebration, she flat-out denied it ever occurring. After a journalist from said paper told her they had a copy of the e-mail (I translated), she said "Ohohohoh, this is very serious if that information is correct." She then asked to return to the paper with a comment, for which she claims she will need half an hour. After that time, she makes herself indisposed to the journalist. When the journalist finally gets hold of Liz Sandberg, several hours later, she refuses to comment the e-mail.

Janna Valik, General-Director at The Swedish Migration Board, says that Liz Sandgren "will not be working as Manager right now". That answer, by the way, means nothing more than that Liz Sandgren can actually be working as Manager again, as I'm writing this.

Of course I've e-mailed The Swedish Migration Board again, as I've now got new questions for them - and also because I still have not received an answer to my first e-mail to them. You will find my new e-mail to them, in its original form and translated to English, in the comment-part of this post.

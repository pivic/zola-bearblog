Yesterday I met up with my parents, my grandmother, my sister, her boyfriend and their two wonderful kids. Sweet. It was really nice. Dad had made an early dinner with a very nice cake and everybody was kind. My sister's kids aren't scared of me any more, at least not like they used to be (which is good). You'll find all pictures from this date [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/archives/date-posted/2007/05/27).

While travelling to my parents' place I finished reading Bodil Malmsten's "[Hör bara hur ditt hjärta bultar i mig](http://allconsuming.net/item/view/2786406)", which is a printed and abridged version of [her blog](http://www.finistere.se). It's in Swedish. I'm pretty sure Malmsten has [Asperger syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome) while/yet maintaining a highly emotive sense of writing. She seems too obsessive and off-the-beaten-path not to have asperger; the bits in her book where she writes about getting hold of a new passport and her unwillingness to give up her old car, respectively, speaks a lot of this. Her integrity rings true, only to be matched by her exact sense of commenting on bad/mediocre/good/great art. She calls herself a sociopath, which is not true and merely serves as a vehicle for her to drive a stake through her own heart before anybody else; that's my amateur psychological reasoning on the matter, anyway. How convenient, blah. I don't know if I'm mad with her because she's so good at writing or because her (lack of) reasoning at times reminds me of my own, and hence easily brings my own short-comings to mind. Still, she writes a fuck lot better than I. Sherlock Holmes once "said" that identifying one's short-comings should be on par with identifying one's strengths. Anyway, her written tidbits of the moles in her garden, of how she says yes to every author-gig imaginable (incessantly hating herself for it), of her love for [The Shield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shield), and of how older women shouldn't be ashamed of desiring young men are just a few of the pieces that make this book very recommendable. Get it!

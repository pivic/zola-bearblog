This afternoon Staffan and Patrik picked us up in their brand-new four-wheel-drive Toyota, a green beast with enough hydraulics to make one shiver in one's boots. We went to a city auction, where old stuff was being doshed off. Mikaela registered us so that we are now eligible to bid for stuff on the Internet, so there you go. We might. Anyway, after that lovely stint we went for a coffee and focaccia at [Non Solo Bar](http://www.nonsolobar.com), before heading to Staffan and Patrik's place to pick up a furry carpet that we're now trying out. It's very discreet in colours and has a fluffy, nice surface. Pictures will follow. Anyway, we contacted Frederic and asked him if he wanted to join in a little dinner later on, which he said yes to, so we all went home to our place where Mikaela made dinner, Frederic turned up and now we've washed away the debris and are calming down with some non-caffeined tea and I've produced [these pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-01-16-dinner) of the evening's doings. There you go.

I just found [FoxyTunes](http://www.iosart.com/foxytunes/firefox), a little Firefox extension that enables the user "to control your favorite media player without leaving the browser. The controls are positioned on the status bar, so no extra space is waisted \[sic\]." I don't know whether it's a good thing or just a lazy thing, but I'm trying it for a little while any way, while playing old [Radiohead](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:2vktk6hx9krw) tracks and [a little Lamb Of God](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:it7uakoksm3z).

I've also changed my mind about Jim Derogatis' "Milk It!", a collection of his writings on the "alternative" music scene during the 90's till recent times. At first it seemed drab, a little boring. Now, it's quite interesting. I think he doesn't have a musician's approach to music, which is good and bad, methinks; Swedish music journos often concentrate on facts that have nothing to do with music. Sure, "how can one judge art?" by all means, but a friendly advice is a good thing. Anyway, Derogatis writes a lot on the people making the music, and not very much about the music itself apart from his short reviews in one of the papers he has written for (_Chicago Sun-Times_). I've only plowed through 70 pages. Will keep you posted.

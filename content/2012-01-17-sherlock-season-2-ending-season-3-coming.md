Apart from Irene Adler sporting [a Twitter account](https://twitter.com/#!/TheWhipHand) and [Watson's blog](http://www.johnwatsonblog.co.uk), is the updated Canon really revived?

Well, yes. I'm amazed to say it, but despite being a little miffed about a few things - the constant Twitter and blog references - it's largely taking in new techniques and revamping the century-old stories to make them contemporary. It's amazing, I think.

Still, I have to tip you off about the old series. [Here's an old post of mine](https://niklasblog.com/?p=2368) of "The Speckled Band" which is still up in its entirety on YouTube.

On comparing the older with the newer series and what I think is the biggest mistake in the latter: what [Jeremy Brett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Brett) has and [Benedict Cumberbatch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Cumberbatch) lacks as Holmes, is subtlety. And acting skills, to be very severe and prompt; what Brett could communicate through looks and very small movements, Cumberbatch has to spend loads of sentences to do. Of course, this can be blamed on the script.

But on the whole, the new series is good. Very good.

And yes, there will be a third series! If it's the last - who knows? Probably. Hopefully. Here's to the canon, et.c.

For sure the above's one of the old titles: moahaha.

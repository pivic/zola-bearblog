Mikaela bought [a whole char](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/72914596) today, so we [filled and rubbed it with thyme and salt](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/72914710), grilled it in the oven at a high temperature and then set off the smoke-alarm. After that died out, we made a fresh salad and aioli to boot.

[The aioli got split](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/72914497), but Mikaela saved it by whipping up an egg-yolk, and just gently poured the split aioli into that, while stirring. An old trick that worked out perfectly!

In the end, [the char looked beautiful](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/72915154), and when you squeezed the near-caramelised lemons over it, everything just turned blissful. Cooking the char at a high temperature did wonders, and making the aioli ourselves was very nice, not to mention that the salad worked very well with the char. [Sweet](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/72915251). All kudos to the char, and of course, to the chef: [Mikaela's a master chef](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/72914823). Hooray!

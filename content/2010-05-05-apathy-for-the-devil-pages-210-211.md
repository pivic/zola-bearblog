From [Nick Kent's new second book on the 1970s](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/057123285X?tag=niklasblog-20):

> In her autobiography _Backstage Passes_ his then-wife Angie recalls receiving a barely coherent phone call from her husband that must have taken place shortly after the Iggy session: 'He was in a house somewhere in LA and three people - a Warlock and two witches - were holding him for some horrible Satan-related reason. He wanted to get away...but the witches wouldn't let him leave.' Flying over from London to help calm her spouse's paranoid fantasies, she ended up consulting a white witch her self about the best way to exorcise demonic spirits from their temporary LA homestead. The real problem, she strongly implied in her text, was that these spirits were nothing more than hallucinations visited upon Bowie due to his grave overdependence on cocaine and a general lack of food and sleep.

During a very quick lunch today I repeatedly listened to [Iggy & The Stooges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Stooges)' "_Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell_". Hallelujah, redemption.

This is what you get by combining a light beer with a "Bloodshot" from [Bröderna Olsson](http://www.garlicandshots.com) in Stockholm. Strong chilis plus an insane amount of garlic. Wonderful! Also known as _red beer_ according to our Texan agents who've found this to be true.

Criz was a bit scared to have her shot at Bröderna Olsson. Later, she surfaced that she thought the drink looked like vomit. Didn't taste like it - according to her.

While waiting for food at Bröderna Olsson, lovely X.

Speaking of the food, the size of this burger was _humongous_! It nearly killed me, but a good thing was my ability to fight it with shots and red beer, I think that killed it. Yes it did.

I'm to tired to check out what the plural of "flamingo" is. Flamingos? Flamingii?

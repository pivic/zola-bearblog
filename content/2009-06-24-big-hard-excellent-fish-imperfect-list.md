This is a try on transcribing Big Hard Excellent Fish's "_Imperfect List_", a.k.a. the song that Morrissey often prefers to play before he hits the stage.

From Wikipedia, on [Pete Wylie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Wylie):

> In 1990 a single called “Imperfect List“ was released under the project name of “Big Hard Excellent Fish“. The spoken-word track is a list of 64 least favourite people and things read by Wylie's then girlfriend and collaborator Josie Jones. The list was written by Wylie and the track was recorded by Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins, although Wylie is not credited on the record. The list ranges from 'Adolf Hitler' to 'lost keys'. In 2004, “Imperfect List“ was used by Morrissey at shows prior to his appearance on stage. The track appears on Morrissey's video of live performance “Who put the M in Manchester?“.

Some words are missing/inaudible to me, but please do comment and I'll fix things asap! The song is available [through Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/7F8mtfS0gKVsNZHNg1czYl). Here I go:

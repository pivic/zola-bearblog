I was recently fooled by the [QT Diary](http://qtdiary.blogspot.com), a blog that was supposedly written by Quentin Tarantino. After reading too many this-is-too-a-real-blog entries on the blog in question, I began poking in the matter and [read this](http://news.com.com/Reservoir+blogs:+Fan+fakes+Tarantino+diary/2100-1026_3-5325241.html), that Tarantino's own publicist has said it's fake, yet really well done.

In the process, I found [Billy Corgan's blog](http://www.billycorgan.com/), which is semi-interesting. He pours his ideas and thoughts out, and I'm delighted to see he's collaborating with [Bon Harris](http://www.mvn-ae.com/images/bon01.jpg) (former [Nitzer Ebb](http://www.intuitivemusic.com/tguidenitzerebb.html) member), has written a poetry book and is releasing his first solo album quite soon. He also seems very happy with life in general. Good for Billy!

Today has (so far) been quite calm. Mikaela and I visited Sebastian's girlfriend's new kitty, a 12-week-old young un. It was a little scared, but I petted it to sleep. Aw! [Here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-29-kitty1.jpg), [are](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-29-kitty2.jpg), [some](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-29-kitty3.jpg), [pictures](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-29-kitty4.jpg). Also, [here's a film](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-28-kitty.3gp) of one of Frederic's space kittens, shot yesterday.

[The new fridge/freezer](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-07-29-fridgefreezer) arrived today. It wasn't tricky to put in place, but it seems it isn't giving full gas. It's at appx. 10 degrees Celsius at max, and it should be appx. 2-3. Mikaela called in to the retailer, who will contact us about it tomorrow.

I picked up "[Blue Spring](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-29-bluespring.gif)", a film I have great hopes for. It seems to be a Japanese answer to "[Rane](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165546/combined)", one of the best films I've ever seen.

I also spotted a couple of cars with customised plates. Wonderful, [this one](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-29-plate1.jpg) and also [this one](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-29-plate2.jpg).

I have been using [30 Boxes](http://30boxes.com) for a while now, and have been trying out [Google Calendar](http://calendar.google.com) for approximately a day, as it was released just there and then.

I think that Google Calendar will grow in due time, when people start pointing out what they want. Hence, I'll draw [my sticks](http://30boxes.com/blog/index.php/2006/04/13/30-boxes-vs-google-calendar/#comment-871) to the table, especially since [30 Boxes now claims that everything Google Calendar will do, they will do better](http://30boxes.com/blog/index.php/2006/04/13/30-boxes-vs-google-calendar). I'm already happy that 30 Boxes supports my mobile phone-carrier by sending me SMS's as reminders of what's up in my life; this is not a hard thing to do though, as all e-mail sent to a certain address are directed to me as SMS's, thanks to said carrier.

[Microsoft will also release an AJAX-laden, iCal-compatible calendar](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1949388,00.asp) in the near future, both as part of the coming OS and as part of Live.com, the web-portal that will be the default homepage for every IE7-user.

Good! Competition in this field is healthy, especially since people need good, quality services to 1) enable them to see their calendar via the Internet and standalone applications, 2) share their calendars with people on different permission-levels and 3) book times with other people using standardised free/busy-tracking.

I just hope that will arrive soon, in a standard that _all_ will follow.

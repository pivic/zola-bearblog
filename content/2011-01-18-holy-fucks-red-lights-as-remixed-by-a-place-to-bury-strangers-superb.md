Now, this is how to remix a track! Big kudos to [A Place To Bury Strangers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%20Place%20to%20Bury%20Strangers). Both the video and the track revamped, and I think the remix sounds a lot like [Front 242](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front%20242)'s "_[Im Rhythmus Bleiben](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L_zMIgwbR4)_". The original video's below the first one, which is the remixed.

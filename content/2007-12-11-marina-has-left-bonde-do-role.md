![BDR](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-12-11-bdr.jpg)[The band](http://www.myspace.com/bondedorole) has just released the following statement at MySpace:

> due to several internal problems between us, we had to cancel a lot of our shows from the European tour and we also had to cancel the scheduled australian tour (everyone knew how excited we were about it!), for that we're really really sorry. and we also anounce that marina is no longer with us, due to these internal problems. we wish her all the best in whatever she decides to do with her future and that she can always count on us as friends. we are working these issues right now as we speak and we hope we can make it up to everyone who we let down this year, in the most awesome way we can!

I hope they'll sort their differences out even though that looks appx. as plausible as me growing a second head. Here's to a phenomenal band entering their next phase, and hopefully this will lead to two exciting ventures instead of a total breakdown!

I recently saw [this video of Girl Talk DJ'ing live](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUVAA1cGREo) using two computers and nothing else, and I also saw that Björn has recently been given his granddad's guitar and is getting excited about playing; I really want to get going at making music with X again. [GarageBand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GarageBand), song and a guitar can get you far. I'm shit at advanced sequencers, I just don't have the patience to learn them, so GarageBand will do nicely.

Anyway, we've started a cover project and as soon as we finish that - which I hope will be the case and soonish - I think it's time we try to create a song of our own. A fault of mine is to artistically aspire to create the best song ever which is why I fail at the start, seeing that my self confidence can't keep up with that desire. Watching Lightning Bolt live last night was a little epiphany of sorts, as they created wonderful, experimental and great music basing their playing on a general love for music plus a great deal of humor.

Speaking of Lightning Bolt, I've uploaded a shitty film [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ygrc-oiABA), but the music...they're such an inspiration to me. Funny as hell and at the same time melodic, shuffling harmonies using drums and one single instrument to make the melodic sounds: an electric bass with banjo-strings attached.

Thom Yorke once sang that anyone can play guitar, and that's right. Anybody. It doesn't matter if you don't write The Best Song Ever and so what if it isn't? As long as what you play is from your heart and you mean it, it's right. "Be true to yourself and you will never fall." Music is neither about how many chords you can play, how many octaves you can sing or how expensive your drumsticks are. Fuck the rules and do what you want to do. There's nobody to stop you.

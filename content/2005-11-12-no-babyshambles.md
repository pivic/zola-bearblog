The night before last night, Bj√∂rg came by. She's Mikaela's best friend, and got riled-up from my saying that there was still a chance to get hold of tickets for Babyshambles' gig in Stockholm on the 18th of November. She even called Johnnie, her boyfriend who was at the time sleeping, and he got tickets at 400SKR (50USD) a piece. All happy!

Until yesterday, when I found out they've cancelled their gig in Stockholm due to "personal reasons". I know I should have seen this [Axl Rose](http://pub.tv2.no/multimedia/TV2/archive/00073/37Axl_Rose_73442a.jpg)\-ish behaviour knocking at the door but I was still stunned when I yesterday wanted to show Frederic that they were playing Stockholm, only to be met by a "CANCELLED"-sign online. Bastards! [No news on their petty site](http://www.babyshambles.net/news/default.asp) either. I hope they're coming back soon though. They're bastards at the moment, but their debut album, "[Down In Albion](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=niklasblog-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=ASIN/B0009X1UKW)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)", is brilliant.

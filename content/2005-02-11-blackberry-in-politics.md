Hell no, says the House of Commons. Read about it all [here](http://news.com.com/2100-1041_3-5572458.html). From the article:

> House of Commons Speaker Michael Martin has declared that anyone using BlackBerrys or other "electronic devices" in the chamber can be thrown out.
> 
> The decision comes shortly after Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell used his BlackBerry to send a profanity-laden tirade to BBC flagship program "Newsnight," believing he had sent it to a Labour PR agency.
> 
> A Norwegian parliamentarian was censured after he was found playing war games on his PDA during a discussion on military action in Afghanistan.

Today's Emergency Phone Day. In comparison with last Thursday, today is a breeze. But a few minutes ago a user called and made my heart sink. It's one of those oh-you-didn't--why-can't-I-get-you-back?-calls, where the user is in a state where he or she unkind. During the call, lasting approximately 15 minutes, she constantly moaned and groaned about how we (i.e. the IT department) aren't doing enough, how we do things the wrong way, and how every user of ours must suffer immensely from what we do.

OK. I hate that kind of garbage as I know it isn't true, but I held my critique.

As I couldn't remote control her computer despite a restart (which normally helps), I tried my best to help her by double- and triple-checking everything she did. Nothing worked.

I didn't get it. Why? I'd covered everything, and I got a sneaky suspicion the error wasn't on our side.

As I went through the login procedures the third time, she asked me if I thought she was stupid. "Of course not, madam, I'm just trying to be precise, so that I can trouble-shoot this problem exactly".

The fourth time I checked her login she suddenly sounded surprised:

I: "...and the number '19' is written before the rest of the digits, and--" She: "What? The number '19' should be written before the rest of my digits?" I: "Yes, exactly. Have you written them before?" She: "No!" I: "That's why you haven't been able to log in. Nothing is wrong, technically speaking, but you didn't type the numbers correctly." She: "OK, thanks."

Then she hung up.

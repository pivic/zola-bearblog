We're getting a kitten, and her name is Blixa. She looks like this:

I cannot tell you how excited I am. I've been flustered and so frustrated by my allergy to all things furry ((Yes, _except_ myself...) animals, that I can't contain myself. I have to post pictures of her, and talk about [her and her adorable siblings](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3256865425) incessantly.

Last night, my parents ushered X and myself to the breeder, who showed us the above 7-week-old wonders. We petted them. We let them climb everywhere on us. They're so lovely that we let them do anything. They jumped about one second, to fall asleep the next. We left, having signed the legal papers that say we'll own - however silly that word sounds; of course Blixa will own us, if any owning is to be claimed - Blixa and have her home with us in the middle of March, if she doesn't lose health and weight, which seems unlikely.

I'm happy. More than happy. Exhilerated. And Lotta's coming back to us tomorrow. Bliss! More pictures of Blixa and her friends are found [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic).

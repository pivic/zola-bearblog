During the week-end Mikaela and I visited Björg and her wonderful family as it was Björg's birthday. I snapped [this film](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-10-09-johnnyossip.3gp) \[3GP\] of Johnny (her man) and Osip (one of their two sons, the other one is Rufus, a lively little squirrel). It was very nice! The kids ran around and were kids, while I adjusted myself. I often think about Mikaela and my having children and it's a very pleasant thought, even though I'm often afraid of the potentiality of me f-ing our offspring's mind up by being an utter twat father. As I've written before, I'm not _really_ afraid of it, it's just me obsessing.

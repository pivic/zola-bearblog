[![Me](http://static.flickr.com/29/98683077_7d7814e033_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=98683077)It's the week-end, isn't it? Laziness prevails in my world. On Friday Mikaela and I went out to see "[De battre mon coeur s'est arràªté](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411270)", a film that I actually won tickets to see. It's about a man-child who's meddling in the very illegal side of the real-estate business, while finding out his love for piano is returning, dealing with that conflict while he cares for his blameful father and trying to come to terms with himself. It's a cataclysmic film, but should you get tired during it, have a [caffeine nap](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/sleep/take-a-caffeine-nap-154237.php). Might be hard, though.

After the film I met up with Zak, who was entertaining his father and cousin from Blighty. Yet again, we met at Bishop's Arms, which was a very nice place. Said cousin and dad left the pub quite early, and so Zak and I drank until we knew it was good time to go home, so we did; both he and I went out the day after - Zak's dad had a party to celebrate he's turned 60 years of age, and I went to \[avatar:https://niklasblog.com/bilder/avatars/fdp.gif\]Frederic\[/avatar\]'s place, where John (Frederic's new flirt) and Fredrik were. We had a nice dinner, nice drinks and talked a lot; very calm and nice, all in all. I wore the tie in the picture, which I really like. Got it at Judith Herr.

Hang on. Frank Zappa is still dead, but [here](http://stores.musictoday.com/store/product.asp?band_id=1039&dept_id=8494&pf_id=ZPCD66&sfid=2)'s his newest release, a live album recorded in excellent quality. Buy now. Speaking of buying, I just ordered [The Boo Radleys](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:3x1tk6rx9kr3)' excellent double-CD anthology "[Find The Way Out](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:pq8m96oo0ep5)" that's available at low price virtually everywhere. If you like [Super Furry Animals](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:uvg9kectjq7v) and have somehow missed this band, pick said CD up and realise there's much more to this band than "Wake Up Boo!". And if you like purchasing funny t-shirts, read [this](http://www.jakenickell.com/entry/1114). If you don't, you will attract "[clown phobia](http://www.changethatsrightnow.com/problem_detail.asp?SDID=809:1477)".

Today I just finished watching "[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373469)", a noir-ish detective story where the main character is quite honest, the plots are thick (albeit quite superficial) and despite some cracks in the metaphorical floor, this is a very good, entertaining film. The dynamics between Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. are sparkling, and they're both very good actors in this film. The colours, lighting and music is grand. I strongly recommend it, so go get.

I wonder how [this film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414982) is, though. Moahaha.

By the way, do you know [grieving baboons handle grief much like humans do](http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060206/baboon_ani.html)? Evolution, not by much.

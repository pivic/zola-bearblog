**update, 2011-03-21**: Microsoft are rectifying this issue, which is killing a lot of upgrades out there. Check [this post](http://blogs.technet.com/b/joscon/archive/2011/03/16/new-information-on-error-code-0xc0000034.aspx) by Microsoft employee joscon on the matter.

First of all, let me start by saying you really don't need to download and install [Windows 7 SP1](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff817622(WS.10).aspx) unless you're running Windows Server 2008 R2. There are no new features for Windows 7, and only [RemoteFX](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff817578(WS.10).aspx) for Windows Server 2008 R2.

So, what happened when I tried to apply Windows 7 SP1 that is now available for download t[hrough Softpedia](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Others/Signatures-Updates/Windows-7-Service-Pack-1.shtml)?

The error message gently translates from Swedish to the English as "An error C0000034 occurred", or "Fatal error C0000034 applying update". Yuck.

One system restore later and I was back on track. That's nice, anyway. Guess I'll have to wait and see what a later update/more looking into that error message gives me.

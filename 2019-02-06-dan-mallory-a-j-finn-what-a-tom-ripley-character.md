[Ian Parker](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/ian-parker), writing for The New Yorker, has produced [this article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions) about **Dan Mallory—**a.k.a. A. J. Finn—a superstar novelist who is about to become even more famous as his first novel, "_The Woman in the Window_", is about to become film.

This is jaw-drooping material. I've not seen anything like it since reading Patricia Highsmith's "_[The Talented Mr. Ripley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talented_Mr._Ripley)_". The main thing about it may be how the subject seems to be well, but acts in ways that seemingly makes others unwell.

Kudos to Ian Parker.

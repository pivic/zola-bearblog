Recently, Erika Ascot killed herself. She is one of the most well-known modern Swedish bloggers, followed by many, hyped by a lot and is solely the product of imaginative minds who made money off her existence.

She was made-up.

Boo-hoo. Who cares whether Erika exists or not? I just saw a show on Swedish public service TV that showed how old people are basically shelved like books, rather than living. And no bloggers are shouting to the roof-tops about that, are they? And is being sedated through medication, lying on a bed collecting sores living? In that case, let me rather believe the Ascots of the world as they _live_.

The content of "Erika's" blog was written by an advertising company and loads of lessers suddenly wanted to slay her:

"Don't you know that blog isn't _for real_?"

So fucking what? Bitch, get a grip on yourself! The contents are good, so shut the hellaup and jump off the idiot bandwagon. What's "real", by the way? Something that's sheer non-fiction? I read only biographies for a long while as I was sick and tired of the fiction genre. Of course, there was no way I could ever find out whether the contents of those biographies were in the least real, other than through vapid investigations of my own. I'm reminded of [the Oprah/James Frey debacle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Million_Little_Pieces).

Yesterday, X and I attended the spreading of the ashes after Erika Ascot. We walked from Storgatan/Sibyllegatan in à–stermalm, everybody picking up white lillies - even though we had already brought our own - and walking past the Hedvig Eleonora church to the end station, where ashes were cast to the wind and champagne was offered. Erika's last words were read:

All in all, a very lovely, sunny Friday afternoon.

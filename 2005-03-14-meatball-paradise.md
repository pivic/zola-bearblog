[![](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-13-food.jpg)](http://www.niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-03-13/images/PICT0038.jpg)[These pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-03-13) show the meatball-, sandwich-, hummus and salad-fest that went down yesterday. Mikaela's focaccia and salad complemented the meatballs by dinner, and I ate everything; I even ate a lot of it today. Fresh food made from excellent produce is the best.

On the way from work today, I tried to leave a lamp at an electrician's store, only to find they had closed for the day. Damn! I comforted myself by picking up an edition of [Public Service](http://www.publicservice.nu), a very nice new Swedish magazine where a lot of good journos write. For instance, there's a competition running in the mag, where readers are tempted with 5000 Swedish crowns, should anybody prove able to submit a photo of a naked Otto Sjöberg. He's the editor-in-chief for Expressen, one of the two biggest rag-mags in Sweden. Among other gems, he's said "To become outraged over a naked picture of somebody is _moral panic_." \[my italics\] So. Public Service has announced a little contest. Anybody who is able to produce a picture of Mr. Sjöberg in the nude, gets 5K. Right atcha, bitch!

I also picked up the first Buddy Bradley omnibus, titelled "[Buddy Does Seattle (The Complete Buddy Bradley Stories from "Hate" Comics, Vol. I, 1990-94)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560976233)". It seems splendid, and just look at the price! 10USD for 340 pages or so? Jaysis. Go git!

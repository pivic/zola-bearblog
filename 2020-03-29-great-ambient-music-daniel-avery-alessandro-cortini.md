Album cover.

I've enjoyed [Alessandro Cortini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Cortini)'s music for a long time. His albums _AVANTI_ and _VOLUME MASSIMO_ were among the best music released in 2017 and 2019, respectively.

He has—together with [Daniel Avery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Avery_(musician))—just released _Illusion of Time_, an instrumental, force-flowing album filled with ambient soundscapes. I strongly recommend that you stream this to cover your concentration and meditation needs.

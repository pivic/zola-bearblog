Maybe this is because I'm now working for a software development company, but...

I almost wished I'd not updated to version [4.1.2](http://getpocket.com/blog/2012/06/available-now-pocket-4-1-2-for-android-with-enhanced-settings-true-black-background-and-improved-device-support). These were quickly fixed so the below bugs are no longer there. They were in all probability fixed server-side, as [Pocket](http://getpocket.com), my fave read-later-app (actually better than Instafetch, I think - and it's free), didn't require another upgrade on my phone, a Samsung Galaxy SII. This is what happened to me following the update, and all of these problems are now gone. Do note that I had no network issues with my phone at the time.

Titles were swapped for links; the ones that look good are the ones that were imported from before upgrading to 4.1.2; the new ones were imported by use of the add-in for Android.

This one popped up when trying to refresh the page.

Post mortem: all's well. I just opened the app ten minutes later, and the bugs were seemingly gone. Don't forget to be a good user and report every bug you come across through the menu in the app! This allows app info to be e-mailed to the developers for a lot less troublesome troubleshooting.

**Edit**:

20 minutes after I e-mailed Pocket support, I received this e-mail back. That's fast.

> We are currently experiencing connection issues across our applications due to Amazon cloud issues. I believe this is the reason why the titles aren't resolving properly, and for the sync issues. We're investigating and hope to bring it back soon.

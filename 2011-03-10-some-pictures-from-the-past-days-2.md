[Drop Coffee](http://facebook.com/dropcoffee) celebrated [Shrove Tuesday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrove%20Tuesday) by proffering the above lovely semla, a teeny tiny one from [Albert & Jacks](http://www.albertjacks.se).

The Pirate Cats helped X and myself to celebrate the day before Shrove Tuesday by loving some more semla, this one styled all home-made, courtesy of [Caf√© Macchiato](http://www.cafemacchiato.se).

At 78 years old. In his sleep. Who would have thunk it? [Here](http://henryrollins.com/news/detail/alan_vega1/)'s [his](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Vega) family's statement about the death.

If you haven't heard Suicide - the duo which Vega formed - do so now; [their first album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_(1977_album)) is still fantastic and not dated: it's futuristic, despite being released in 1977, the year I was born.

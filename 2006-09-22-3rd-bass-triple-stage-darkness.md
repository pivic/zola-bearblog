[![3rd Bass](http://static.flickr.com/51/169757640_b05963ca3d_m.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/77556110@N00/169757640)Back in the day, when the Beastie Boys weren't the only visible mainly white (yeah, I know there are no non-white people in that group) hip-hop-outfit in town, these guys rocked with tracks such as "[The Gas Face](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4IQlsm7Ds)" and "Pop Goes The Weasel" and I do like the first one, so right now, without further ado: Triple Stage Darkness from "[The Cactus Album](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B0000024K6%26tag=niklasblog-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B0000024K6%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "The Cactus Album")" which you should get. I mean, yeah, the track sounds dated but it's still nice. You've got to get into a bunch of them to be able to appreciate them fully.

P.s. Bonus points if you recognise the start of the track.

_inLife gets the gas face!_ No, truly, I've let it slide, they're shite.

As usual, this track will go offline after a week has passed.

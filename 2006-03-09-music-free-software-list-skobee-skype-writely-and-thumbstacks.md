Just like watching [these old promo-shots of rappers](http://www.thefader.com/blog/articles/2006/03/08/rap-a-lot-has-a-new-scanner-or-something) (the one of Bushwick Bill is beautiful), I've been getting into [The Arcade Fire](http://www.allconsuming.net/item/view/37228), [Harold Budd](http://www.allconsuming.net/item/view/310218) and [an old Pharcyde-single](http://www.allconsuming.net/item/view/487570). Music makes you lose control.


"Ripping music" means you convert what's on an audio media, e.g. a CD, to digital media, for instance MP3 and FLAC. For this, true audio-nerds use [EAC](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de), which is free. Usually, I just use [CDex](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdexos), which is quite simple to use for ripping. When I convert audio to FLAC, I do that through [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org) which is dead simple. When it comes to EAC, the super-nerdy part comes here: [here](http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=28124) are suggestions for LAME-settings, and [here](http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=16146&hl=command+line+options+eac) are is a little tutorial on how to convert an album to an image with FLAC.

I just installed [Skype](http://www.skype.com), paid a little money and called my little Filipino friend who's living in the USA. I love abusing The Queen's English, and this way I did it very cheaply, even though I called her mobile phone over the Internet. Hey, isn't Skype meant to mean free calls over the Internet? Sure, it still is, but I called her physical mobile phone, which means somebody (i.e. me) has to pay for it. Calling from computer to computer using Skype is still free.

Writing of social software, I'm trying to get people ot use [Skobee](http://skobee.com), which is a site for people who plan meetings online. To do this, one simply sets time and date (and you can even pick a "fuzzy" date, like "sometime next week") and details who gets invited to this meeting. The site looks nice, and doesn't seem to be designed to snag members, but of course (...) I signed up and arranged a little meeting on Saturday. We'll see how many mates of mine care to show up, especially as there's little time left. Some, like [Jesper](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/39567676), who's having his first child with [Marie](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/8206921) within a week or so, are excused...

I'm going to try out [Thumbstacks](http://www.thumbstacks.com), a free way to create and share online presentations. Mm, MS PowerPoint-killer. Interesting; now that [Google has bought Writely](http://writely.blogspot.com/2006/03/google-yep-google.html), the Office-suite-world is rocking. I just hope they all ([Microsoft definitely included](http://news.com.com/Microsoft+to+update+Office+2007+beta/2110-1012_3-6047755.html)) are going to leave their beta-shells soon.

Today I saw and cheered the Stockholm Pride Parade together with X, her mother and her mother's fiancée. We had a lot of fun during the two hours that we spent watching the extravaganza. This time was lovely. We saw everything from [Kungsträdgården](https://plus.google.com/113906521162871136718/about?gl=se&hl=en), where we saw different equipages of different people; political parties ((Any ideas as to why Sverigedemokraterna and Kristdemokraterna were missing?)), the police, firepersons, proud parents, people who were angry at Putin/Russia ((Last year, a law was passed in Russia that made it illegal to hold LGBT pride parades for 100 years. Also, gay people are discriminated all the time in Russia, e.g. [where sports are involved](http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/russian-lawmaker-we-will-arrest-gay-athletes-tourists-olympic-games300713).)), the religious people, Anonymous and all kinds of people. It was lovely. And at the same time a reminder of how we all need to think up against the [heteronormative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronormativity) society that a lot of us live in.

Here's some video action as shot by yours truly:

There was a lot of joy in the air. Celebrating differences in people, and the tone was one of acceptance and inspiration, exhibition and love. I even felt like the people who were playing the most obvious music, stuff like The Village People's "_YMCA_", reclaimed it at that time, even though it's some of the most simplistic, prejudiced stamp of what "gay music" is like. On the other hand, the more unexpected stuff is what I liked the most:

HoF, Homo-, bi- och transpersoner i försvaret, played a Beastie Boys track live! They reclaimed "_Fight For Your Right_", a frat party song so stupid that the Beasties refused to play it after their first album came out, but HoF made it into something else - while I was wearing my Beastie "Check Your Head" tee. Woo, woo! A little live music goes a long way.

All in all, I really liked the fest. It was really great to stand there for a long time and see it all, take it in. Hugged Kawa as he came by as part of the Kurdish equipage, and saw Hans and a guy from work!

Attached are a bunch of pics that I shot. There are some explanatory captions. Enjoy!

I've spent a little portion of today, trying to find the last piece of the [Morrissey puzzle](https://niklasblog.com/images/2004-05-18-moz.jpg) this time around.

Finding Morrissey's new album (in its limited edition) was not hard. By the way, it contains a DVD, which is a mere 200MB fat: it contains a photo gallery that's weirdly constructed: for instance, you see a picture. The next picture is a zoomed variation of that picture. The third is a zoomed variation of the already zoomed-in one. Wankers. There are lyrics provided, that are...lyrics, and then there's the video. It's not worth it, really, even though the video is _nice_.

Looking for the single, "Irish Blood, English Heart", was harder. I found CD2 at the place where I found the ltd. ed. album. Finding CD1, which contains "It's Hard To Walk Tall When You're Small", which in my opinion is the best b-side on this single, all in all, followed by "The Never Played Symphonies", was not easy. It took a lot of ground-work. At first, I was going to give up, to call it quits as I already have the song on MP3, but my obsessive side took over completely. I had to find the first CD. And I did, at the biggest retailer.

There's a small record shop near where I work, called Space Records. There are all kinds of interesting myths regarding the owner and his what-have-you-nots. The place is a mystery in itself. Almost every record is tagged with a hard-to-remove sticker that sometimes actually tells you the correct month the album was released. Every other record is tagged with the same type of sticker, though wearing a layer of tape. The sticker announces "DELUXE" even though one cannot rely on this in the least. The persons working in the shop are another thing altogether.

When asking them when an unreleased album is due, they immediately tell you they don't know, but that it can be found out by noting my name and phone number; as soon as they get the album, they'll let me know! OK, that's kind, but when I state I would only like to know the release date of the album, they say they can get it the same week it's released, and after I ask them for the release date for the third time, and they reply that they can look that up - but wouldn't I rather like to pre-order the album? - I tell them I already have it, but I'd like to know when it's released; trust me, it's the ONLY way to get them to stop. And then, they mostly lie about not knowing when. I sometimes tell them to get on their computer and tell me, as it tells them all kinds of release dates. I do that in a nice way. Remember my earlier post on there being no good service available in Sweden, unless you pay dearly for it? That's very applicable to record stores here, as well.

It's not as if they're all pretending to be autistic - it's as if they all are.

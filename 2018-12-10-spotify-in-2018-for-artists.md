I just found out that an artist who is on Spotify and this year has had:

- 564k plays of their music
- 176k "fans"
- 39k hours of their music streamed

...gets a total of $13 USD for it.

Spotify isn't lying when it—after counting out those facts— writes "Thanks for an amazing year" to that artist.

I'd truly be amazed if Spotify would start to pay artists a fair dividend.

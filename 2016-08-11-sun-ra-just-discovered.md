I'm just listening to **[Sun Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ra)** live in Stockholm, recorded in 1971. Here's an example:

That's some seriously twisted shit. I mean, Frank Zappa and Sun Ra are quite similar, even though Sun Ra doesn't even touch the levels of commercialism and doo-wop that Zappa played. This shit is intense. Brian Eno posted [this link](http://bigozine2.com/roio/?p=1578) on Twitter, which made me find the album.

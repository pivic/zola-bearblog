From [Into The Woods](http://intothewoods.tv):

> Okkervil River stopped by the Crystal Ballroom back in June. We caught up with them during the day just long enough to shoot a performance of “_I Guess We Lost_“, a b-side from their latest LP I Am Very Far, out on Jagjaguwar.

This is a good b-side - although I must tip you of "_[Gold Faces](http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16134-gold-faces)_", another b-side that I like better which is from "**Rider**" - and this performance is good. I like the video and the colours. And Pat's playing the acoustic guitar, all beardy!

And I've never seen a percussion-and-trumpet-setup like this ever before:

> Sheff made it sound like they do a session like this in every city: “We've done every song on the album stripped-down and acoustic five fucking million times, and we wanna do something different.“
> 
> A quick search reveals that perhaps they haven't done one of these in every city. Regardless of where all those stripped-down acoustic versions have gone, we're lucky that they saved the b-side for us. Through “_I Guess We Lost_,“ a song the band hadn't performed live since they last played at the Crystal in 2010, Sheff grants us entry to his heartbreaking soul““ a place that I hadn't visited in years.

Can't wait to see the peeps soon again. [Way Out West](http://wayoutwest.se) will be blissful, and Gothenburg won't know what hit it in less than a day.

[![Tacheles, 2011](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5149/5617950220_7a16b7a1a4.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/5617950220) _Tacheles in April 2011._

X and I have twice visited beautiful, occupied, self-sustained [**Tacheles**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunsthaus_Tacheles), a place in Berlin where art has meant more to life than money. Tacheles closed its doors to artists yesterday, and the owner of the building ousted those staying there. The place will be rented for oodles of money. The artists left peacefully [despite protests throughout](http://kritikdesign.blogspot.de/2012/06/show-your-support-send-your-email.html).

Sadly, capitalism often leads to philistinism, as is the case here.

To paraphrase [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/sep/05/closure-tacheles-berlin-sad-alternative-art) from The Guardian:

> I don't suppose Tacheles will even be mentioned in histories of art because it did not produce any "major artists" or "iconic works". It was not trying to. It was an experiment in the power of imagination. May it be restless in memory.

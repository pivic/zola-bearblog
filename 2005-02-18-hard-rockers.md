Yesterday I met up with Rade after work. I had bought tickets to see (former drummer of Guns 'n' Roses) Steven Adler's new band, Adler's Appetite, and (former singer of Iron Maiden) Paul DiAnno at Mondo. I'm not even into hard rock, metal or anything like it, but I do love GnR's "Appetite For Destruction" as it's one of those albums that will never give up on you or vice versa. Almost every detail of that album works. That was (of course) way before Axl Rose went mad and split the band up.

I got to Rade's place, we had sushi and watched a speech by Arnold the Incredible Bulk. The face-lifted bulk, mind you! Anyway, we did watch parts of it, and he's amazing. He has utter charisma yet bats for the totally wrong team. To constantly use his rhetoric even puts [Dennis Miller](http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/26/tv.dennismiller.ap) to shame. I mean, film-references to win people over (wins cheers from the republicans who actually were there to hear the speech) are one thing, using that all the time is another one (more cheers from the same bunch) but constantly referring to your opponents as "girlie-men", that you'll "kick their asses" or that you're an "ass-kicker" (extreme amounts of cheers) just shows that a lot of republicans justify the old Bill Hicks-saying: just remove the safety labels off everything and the problem will take care of itself.

Anyway, we listened to old Iron Maiden and GnR songs, got more in the mood by downing a few gin 'n' tonics, when Rade's sister, Tamara of Mozambique, showed up. She reminds me so much of my own sister! Maybe that's why it's so goddamn fun to beat her, too? Must be a brother-sister thing. I haven't seen my sister in a long while. It's time to catch up again so I can kick her ass again. She's actually built just like Tamara: small, thin as hell yet unbelievably strong! The trick: don't try to win by hitting them - here's how you beat them - quicky pick them up, throw them away, shout obscenities and run fast as hell! It's probably the only way.

Oh so we went to meet Micke and Sebastian, two thirds of Mikaela's brotherhood, with their famed TV friend, Anders, who was a little more than slightly scared from knowing he has a homosexual fan-club writing about him on the net. Har har! He must be flattered though. If he'd be ashamed or embarrassed from that, he probably wouldn't mention that.

We went to Mondo after a couple of beers, and drank a few more beers, waited for the first band, which consisted of some quite boring Swedes with a frontman who had the personality of a thawed popsicle; he stood and manically stared at everything and everybody as he boringly pranced around on stage, his comrades gawking around, seemingly also quite bored. Crap. Then DiAnno came on. He looks like [Fred Durst](http://www.ihatefreddurst.com) after five years on drugs, practicing American football once every three weeks, and a steady Burger King diet. Too bad he sounded like it, too. I'm sure that if I had any preconception (or affection) for Iron Maiden I may have liked him a lot. Rade screamed to the intro of, and sang along to "The Prowler" anyway, so I guess something good came out of it!

Adler's Appetite followed. They sucked, too, but it was fun hearing the old rock anthems although there seemed to be a few problems: except for the drummer, the rest of the band were, of course, just karaoke musicians. A cover band, whose members were bored. The singer looked like any idiot off the American Idol bandwagon, who tried to look "hard" but probably is the type of person who'd say "[Bob Gandalf](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/11/18/bmaid18.xml)" when asked "What's Band Aid, really?". The only good musician in that band was the lead guitarist, even though he carried a massive Slash-chip on his shoulder.

[Here](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=655&a=380665&previousRenderType=6) you'll find a somewhat twisted review of the gig, courtesy of DN. Rade and I lamented the fact that we missed out on the Megadeth gig a couple of days ago, but [this review](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1323&a=380233), also from DN, says ailing readers shouldn't really worry.

I just upgraded my installation of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org). "What's that?" Well, at the end of this blog there "Powered by WordPress" in little letters. It's the software that runs this blog, and it's the best blog system I've ever tried. If I was to start an intranet, an info page, a little online gazette or something like that in a work-environment, I'd opt for this. It's so good I might start crying should I write more so hence I won't.

I've just installed [Pimpzilla](http://people.zeelandnet.nl/marco/pimpzilla). "What's that?" No, you Filipino, it's not Bootsy Collins' next album. See a screenshot [here](http://people.zeelandnet.nl/marco/pimpzilla/images/pimpzilla.jpg) and realise it's a Firefox theme, blinged out to the max! So go get it.

I've been hung-over the entire day so now I'll go back to zombie-mode, thanks.

Missing in pic: lead guitarist.

On Friday, Joel and I went to Slaktkyrkan to see Bad Cash Quartet live.

One of the few Whoa Dad-managed bands that I like, this band made an outstanding album—_Outcast_—which is available to stream. This lot always wanted to make it big, and they did, in Sweden, among the indie rock peeps.

The gig was nice with some good rowdiness. Check my video below:

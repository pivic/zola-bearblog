There have been no sites devoted to wine, but now there suddenly are two.

[Cork'd](http://www.corkd.com) appeared a week ago, and [WineLog](http://www.winelog.net) just launched.

Even though I'm no big drinker or even taster of wines, I do love good wine. And sites such as these are very welcome, especially with people like me, who can't remember more than a few really exceptional wines.

I haven't tried the sites out, but [TechCrunch has reviewed WineLog](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/05/24/wine-lovers-now-have-a-web-20-site), which I think looks very web 1.0 and not as Ruby on Rails as Cork'd. Having browsed the two, it seems they need a lot more reviews before they both get rolling, but for people who want to keep track of their inventory or search for reviews, it will rock.

I hope they're including a mobile search-function; I can't think of the number of times I've telephoned friends or searched the net through my PDA while in a _Systembolaget_, i.e. the only "franchise" (that's owned by the state) that's allowed to sell alcohol in Sweden.

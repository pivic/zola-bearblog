As I seldom find patience for making tracks of my own, they turn out half-a-minute-long. Add my non-existing skills when composition is involved, and you've got short tracks that have very little to do with traditional ways of writing tracks. Lock Burt Bacharach and myself in a room, tell us we'll be released as soon as we collaborate on a track and he'll most likely go crazy in an hour or so.

Despite this, I've manufactured "[February](http://www.last.fm/music/Niklas+Pivic/_/February)", a new track. I've added more tracks to my triple-imaginary-platinum-selling album "[Die Kummin Und Die Mandel](http://www.last.fm/music/Niklas+Pivic/Die+Kummin+Und+Die+Mandel)", so click that link if you want even more.

I've just read [this article](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=148&a=370784&previousRenderType=6) about 10 people getting killed and over 200 people getting injured due to a attempted suicide mission gone wrong in Los Angeles, USA. Apparently, a person wanted to die, so he parked his car on the rail-road tracks but skipped out of the car, leaving it to get devastated by the train. Unfortunately, the train derailed and people died, leaving others injured.

Today's also the [bloodiest day yet](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=148&a=370825&previousRenderType=1) of the USA vs Iraq land-rape. 36 Americans have died in Iraq.

This makes an excellent parallel to the place in the film "Bowling For Columbine", where Michael Moore says the day the Columbine murders occurred, the USA performed their most atrocious bombings of Serbia, killing many innocents and bombing a hospital, a school and a factory that made medicine.

That was, as I've stated previously in this blog, all nicely covered up by these murders, which were all over the news.

So today, when the biggest number of Americans are killed in 24 hours yet, the current Bush II-administration probably wants the world to mourn the ten people who were killed in a suicide tragedy, to the collective mind off the unpleasant stuff that happens elsewhere in the world. "And if you don't mourn, you're not with us, which means you're terrorists!" Dubya said that. No, he didn't. But he could very well have, and you know it.

What mind-numbing shit, really. It takes a failed suicide-attempt to switch the agenda from "How come the USA has become a paragon for total fascism, land-raping and nationalistic garbage" to "The terrorized nation mourns and Bush II is right up there, watching the nation, while he, too, mourns". Think of the background to things the next time you see Dubya smile. I just can't let go of this. I can't. No matter how hard I try to focus to find bigger issues in the world, I can't see any more destructive power in the past 50 years, than the US governments. I've had relatives see their loved ones die because of those governments. I have lived through their killing democracy in other countries to install US-friendly dictatorships, and not many nations mind. Sweden's "neutral", so we don't _not_ mind, it's just that we don't even listen to that issue. We only do when it suits us. That's neutral for you.

So one has to mind, and read, and nurture thought. Even as I live in Sweden, a very "neutral" country that hasn't been officially involved in a war for long, and I have friends in the USA who aren't really touched by the war in the least, I feel it's an intellectual duty to just grab a hold of oneself and ask "Do I want to send my loved ones to their deaths to please our mad government?" or how about "Can I accept living in a totalitarian society that destroys people so that an elite can make an abundance of money?" Just vote the idiots the fuck out, and if that doesn't work - there's always civil disobedience. How many US congress-persons have kids who are in Iraq? One. And I don't think his son was one of those 36 killed.

Oh, and whether you're mourning something/someone/somewhere or not right now, don't forget:

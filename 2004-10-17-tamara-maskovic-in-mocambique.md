Rade's sister, Tamara, works with enlightening people in Moà§ambique about HIV and AIDS. She teaches about health issues. Virii are abound, and as AIDS threatens to wipe out a huge part of the population, she sees to it that people learn to protect themselves.

Sydsvenskan, a Swedish magazine, has written an article of her work [which is available here](http://sydsvenskan.se/varlden/article81472/Hon-kampar-mot-hiv-i-Moccedilambique.html), where Tamara speaks of her work, the people, the environment around her and the history of the place. For you non-Swedish-understanders (!) out there, check it out anyway. The photos are very nice and technicolourish.

Go, Tamara! The world needs more people like her.

From Julia Ebner's _[Going Dark: The Secret Social Lives of Extremists](https://goingdark.shortstack.com/xMrHhh):_

> _Fight Club_ and _The Matrix_ are also standard alt-right movies. Indeed, Hannibal Bateman, the managing editor of the white supremacist magazine Radix Journal, explained in an article entitled ‘Generation Alt-Right’ that ‘for many alienated young White men our credo could be summed up in that most angsty of films, _Fight Club_’, citing the following dialogue from the movie  
>   
> We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War’s a spiritual war … our Great Depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.  
>   
> It is Bateman’s belief that whites have been brainwashed into forgetting that they are ‘the descendants of conquerors and settlers who brought a civilization to entire continents’. The migration crisis and Donald Trump, he thinks, may have led to ‘the nagging search for what’s been wrong since as long as we can remember’, a sudden awakening that he equates with that featured in _Fight Club_.

[Here](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/20/chuck-palahniuk-interview-adjustment-day-black-ethno-state-gay-parenting-incel-movement)'s the kicker from Chuck Palahniuk, the author of _Fight Club_, interviewed in The Guardian in 2018:

> “It’s fascinating that the group that can’t get laid is now adopting the same language. It shows how few options men have in terms of metaphors: a skimpy inventory of images. They have [_The Matrix_](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/13/the-red-pill-screening-divides-campus-libertarians-from-pro-women-groups) – there’s a lot of red pill, blue pill stuff – and they have _Fight Club_. The only other thing is [_Dead Poets Society_](https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/21/favourite-film-dead-poets-society), where men go into a cavern and say poems to each other, and they’re not going to adopt that.” Women, he says, have more literature about female social structures, the likes of [_The Joy Luck Club_](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/22/amy-tan-writing-exhilarating-wish-hadnt-been-published-memoir-joy-luck-club) or [_How to Make an American Quilt_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/125414/how-to-make-an-american-quilt-by-whitney-otto/9780345388964/). “Those have a script and roles and determined ways of being, that women can adopt in order to be together long enough to share their lives.” Don’t men have sports or the pub, instead? “Those social groups don’t produce the memes and one-liners and metaphors.” Palahniuk doesn’t see _Fight Club_ as particularly gendered anyway. “It was more about the terror that you were going to live or die without understanding anything important about yourself.”

I know nothing of **[Gordon Lightfoot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Lightfoot)**. Or, really, about this song, named "_[If You Could Read My Mind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You_Could_Read_My_Mind_(song))_". But I heard [Neil Young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young)'s cover of this song on his new album, "[A Letter Home](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Letter_Home)", and decided to check out the original.

I was instantly floored. It's beautiful.

I immediately caught on to the chorus, which to me resounded of "_The Greatest Love Of All_" ((Perhaps best issued in [this version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9yf-Qa_1M), made by [Kevin Rowland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rowland).)) but that matters little.

> If I could read your mind, love What a tale your thoughts could tell Just like a paperback novel The kind the drugstores sell When you reach the part where the heartaches come The hero would be me But heroes often fail And you won't read that book again Because the ending's just too hard to take

I hope you like it, too.

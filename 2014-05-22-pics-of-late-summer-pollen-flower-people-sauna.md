This is pollen that roars down from the trees. It's everywhere.

Having lunch in the park. It literally felt incredible. As though the next gust of wind would bring snow and cold winds.

Johan, chilling.

The sign says "FÖRETAGEN AB - MEN'S SAUNA". Actually, "företagen" is the plural form of "company", so "THE COMPANIES - MEN'S SAUNA" is what it says. It's a communal sauna and shower at work, maintained by the company that owns the house where loads of companies are housed, among them, the one I work for.

Disclaimer: I've not used the shower. Nor the sauna.

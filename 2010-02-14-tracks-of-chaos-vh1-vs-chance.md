While watching VH1 for once, X and I made up a game: come up with a category and let the TV tell you what you like. First we come up with a suitable category and the first song that's played is X's "pick", the second one's mine, then we come up with a new category and it rolls on. Even though I'm bad at explaining, I think you'll understand it by getting into the groove:

**The song that you listen to during sex**

X: Phats and Small - "_[Turn Around](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSY-2fjW7Wo)_" me: [Toni Basil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Toni_Basil_Mickey.jpg) - "_[Mickey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4CyNvEfWoE)_"

"Got to turn around/Listen to what I say"? My god! And "Hey [Mickey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_%28song%29 "Mickey (song)"), you're so fine"? The video for "_Mickey_" is...beyond bizarre.

**The song that you listen to when you feel the worst ever and you desperately want to feel better**

X: Earth, Wind and Fire - "_[Boogie Wonderland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLGa4X5H2c)_" me: Wham - "_[Club Tropicana](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5tZcnpTpeQ)_"

Well, while Earth, Wind and Fire could perk you up, listening to Wham makes me want to reach for my revolver. [George Michael](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Michael "George Michael") itself is a clownboat of unlikely proportions.

**The song that you dance naked to when the other's not at home**

X: [Daft Punk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk "Daft Punk") - "_[Around the World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R8DeBVBCzM)_" me: Amii Stewart - "_[Light My Fire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5vYnZIvU3o)_"

I can't very well imagine myself doing the bogle to an old disco cover-track, but strangely enough, I _can_ imagine X doing a robotic mummy twirl...

**The song that completely embodies what my mother most wanted to advise me**

X: House of Pain - "_[Jump Around](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwQbPgouUYo#t=8)_" me: [John Paul Young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Young "John Paul Young") - "_[Love Is In The Air](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klaS33CCrfQ)_"

Ha! X's mom would tell her to jump around, but in an ordained fashion. I've no idea how to interpret the John Paul Young-track, though.

**The song that I thought of upon meeting you for the first time**

X: Cher - "_[Believe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbXiECmCZ94)_" me: [John Travolta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Travolta "John Travolta") - "_[Greased Lightnin'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHN9w0cVWTg)_"

"_Believe_" is a sweet one in comparison with Mr. Scientology getting groovy with his friends in the auto-shop. _Greased lightnin'/greased, greased lightnin'_. Erhm.

**The one song you want to be played at our wedding**

X: B-52s - "_[Love Shack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leohcvmf8kM)_"

Here the programming at VH1 stopped and turned over to play contemporary hits, so my "wedding track" was to be [Emiliana Torrini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil%C3%ADana_Torrini "Emilà­ana Torrini")'s "_Jungle Drum_", but really, no way! But The B-52s, any day!

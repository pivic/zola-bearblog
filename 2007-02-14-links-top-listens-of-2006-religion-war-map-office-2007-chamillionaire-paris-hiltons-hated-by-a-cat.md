Hey! Check out [what artists have been topping my list of listens for 2006](http://www.last.fm/user/pivic/charts/?charttype=12month&subtype=artist). Just found that out. That's for last.fm, though. I know somebody has probably hacked together some nifty way to sync what's been listened to on my iPod with last.fm, but I haven't found it yet. I did, however, find out that [foobar2000](http://foobar2000.org), my audio-player of choice on Windows, hasn't been sending my stats to last.fm properly. Why? I had to update the audioscrobbler-plugin. Do it [here](http://www.last.fm/user/Ganymed/journal).

Looking for a miraculous display of religion since 3000 years before christ? From the site:

> How has the geography of religion evolved over the centuries, and where has it sparked wars? Our map gives us a brief history of the world's most well-known religions: Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism. Selected periods of inter-religious bloodshed are also highlighted. Want to see 5,000 years of religion in 90 seconds? Ready, Set, Go!

Find that map [here](http://www.mapsofwar.com/ind/history-of-religion.html)!

[Here](http://news.com.com/2300-1012_3-6152560-1.html)'s a nice screen-shot comparison between Office 97 and Office 2007.

Talking of Office 2007, Microsoft has decided to cast off the nick-name "the ribbon", and name it [the Fluent](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/developer/how_fluent_are_you_with_office_2007.html). Wait, what about the [Floaty](http://www.winsupersite.com/images/showcase/office12_b1_02_03.jpg)? MS hasn't said anything about that, yet.

More Office 2007: I'm looking forward to [Scout](http://www.istartedsomething.com/20070124/scout-office-2007), which seems to be for Office 2007 what [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com) is for OSX.

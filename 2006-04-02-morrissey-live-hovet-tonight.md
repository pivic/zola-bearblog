[![Morrissey tee](http://static.flickr.com/34/122129303_da99611dd5_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=122129303) I just came home from seeing Morrissey live at Hovet.

It was a good show, and I liked "Still Ill" and "Life Is A Pigsty" best. His comments were really good, and the band was tight; I don't really know for how long [Jesse Tobias](http://www.tonyvisconti.com/news/nov05/jesse.jpg "Jesse Tobias, relatively new guitarist for Morrissey."), the new guitarist who has replaced [Alain Whyte](http://www.tonyvisconti.com/news/nov05/boz_alain.jpg "Boz Boorer to the left, Alain Whyte to the right."), has been part of the troupe, but he's fresh and good.

I managed to snap [this film](http://www.vimeo.com/clip=59432) \[appx. 19MB, QuickTime\] tonight, using my super-duper mobile phone. Hence, the quality is crap, but you can actually hear bits of the music, and clearly (mostly) hear what Morrissey is saying.

Here's a list of **some notable alterations** that were made to lyrics, music plus some in-between song comments by Morrissey:

"I decree today that life/is simply taking and not giving/England is _swine_" on "[Still Ill](http://www.compsoc.man.ac.uk/~moz/lyrics/thesmith/stillill.htm)"

"The answer is, yes, I am still ill."

"Well, according to the mid-week sales in Sweden, our new CD-album, 'Ringleader Of The Tormentors', is almost in Sweden, number one."

"My name is Gustav." - said while introducing the band.

"Do you actually like ice-hockey? I do. And it's a great game."

"Tomorrow, we go to Helsinki. \[is met by cheers and boo's\] Helsinki is nice."

"I still see you have Marabou here...but my favourite is...Plopp."

Mikey Farrell plays "[Helan GÃ¥r](http://www.heskonsult.se/Swede-L/swedlsnaps.html)", a very folky Swedish song that's always played when people are about to down schnapps, and the track segues into "Trouble Loves Me".

**edit**: Morrissey might have been using [the same shirt as at SXSW](http://www.flickr.com/photos/avt/119143925). Ooh, conspiracy theories abound! Or just theories such as "Ooh-er! He actually uses the same clobber more than once? Oh no, he's _human_!"

The first review of the show [courtesy of Stockholm City](http://www.city.se/ArticlePages/200604/02/20060402222620_City145/20060402222620_City145.dbp.asp); they complain about the awful sound, the boring audience (at one point Morrissey actually asked "Are you bored?") and rounds off by saying Morrissey is a great entertainer, but that this show wasn't one of his stronger; I agree.

**edit 2**: [this](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1745619,00.html) is a wonderful article off The Guardian, where Mark Taylor, founder of the foremost fanzine on The Smiths, "Smiths Indeed", tells his story. It's a labour of love, followed by reader comments.

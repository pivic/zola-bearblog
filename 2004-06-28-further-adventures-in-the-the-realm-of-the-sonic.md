Once again, he has out-done himself. Our famous upstairs neighbour last made his presence known on 2004-06-07, and this time a full five minutes earlier. At 05:45 his clock-radio (and if it is so, let me slay the radio broadcasters) went on, to be turned off at 06:10.

This time, it sounded like a very short bit from Wham's “[I'm Your Man](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/w/wham!/146072.html)“, as if remixed by [Cornelius](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDSUB040312261145551591&sql=Byj9ks38ua3ng). Add the sound of a broken washing-machine and I would say you are on par with what I mean.

I wrote him a polite letter but Mikaela went berzerk at the idea of letting him have it. Instead, I am to try and speak with him tonight, i.e. if Mikaela doesn't want to, as they've apparently struck some gold mine of a friendship; Mikaela also loves to make noise. ;) Maybe they can form the next [Mille Plateaux](http://www.jahsonic.com/MillePlateaux.html)?

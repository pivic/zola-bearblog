Some shrooms just growin' outside work.

Sweet-potato soup with feta cheese and pumpkin seeds...marvellous. X and I are yet again getting back to more home-styled cooking. Some soups to cheer on the coming of Fall taste even better than what it sounds and looks like!

Neighbourhood kitty gone by.

Now, don't worry. I hate most pictures that are churned out by Instagram and apps like it so I won't be remaking mine en masse. Apart from the pic below of a seemingly pissed-off Blixa.

Alvik is a bizarre little town, if you can call it that; imagine an intersection between railway and subway with some shops strewn about and that's it. I shudder when I'm there, as it just feels devoid of feeling, in lack of a better term. Might have something to do with [the time when X, myself and The Pirates were stuck there for (what seemed like) hours in the middle of freeeezing winter as the entire transportation system had broken down](https://niklasblog.com/?p=4870).

And another **fuck you, SL!** shout-out on the basis of that! You can take _that_, you can take _that_...

More Alvik madness. This is found outside a hotel.

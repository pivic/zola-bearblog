'Social distancing and common sense has characterised this year's audition'.  
Even the idiots behind the jury table sit far too close to each other to adhere to any rules about the matter.

Bar the fact that this programme is made by buffoons who just want to churn out more young people to make one album that they've had no say in to then fade away, this show has taken on a new turn in Sweden.

As you know, Sweden and COVID-19 have gone really well together; we're currently in what people over here jokingly refer to as 'the second wave'.

Auditions for Swedish 'Idol' started when COVID-19 really came to play in our country:

Pär Lärnström, the shouty and never-listening host of 'Idol', touched elbows with the kids to show that 'Idol' was taking its responsibility.

Sadly, they took their responsibilities as well as they used the term 'physical distancing': never.

As we're entering a new wave of COVID-19 as part of our current state of pandemic contagion, it's not weird to note that, well, perhaps TV4—the TV channel that broadcasts 'Idol'—didn't do their job. They still don't.

Lärnström started touching the kids by using his hands, during the audition phase. As the auditions passed and the kids started performing live, they hugged both each other, their families, and whatnot.

Currently, four or five performing kids have fallen ill with COVID-19.

We get what we deserve. Or, do we?

Kids will always be idiots. We know this. Sweden hasn't imposed any kind of lockdown. The adults who run the show that is 'Idol' should have followed the common sense that they've lied about having done; why did TV4 not stop it?

Simple: greed and money.

'Idol' is, without any doubt, one of the biggest cash cows out there for TV4, which is one of the bigger TV channels in Sweden. As people gear up to see the show live, they can't avoid getting slammed with ads, which means tasty money for TV4.

Last Friday, performing kids were forced to stay in their hotel rooms and broadcast their performance from there.

Some of the contestants looked completely under the weather, especially those who were diagnosed with COVID-19. One or two of them said that they'd never felt worse in their entire lives, but still made heart gestures with their hands, looking absolutely awful.

What signal is TV4 sending to their viewers by allowing this to go on?

Remember: [over 600,000 people are suffering from post-COVID-19-related illnesses](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/13/i-was-infected-with-coronavirus-in-march-six-months-on-im-still-unwell). Young people suffer a _lot_.

As Indra Elg was forced out of the competition, she cried alone in her room and seemed both distraught and sick. Lärnström, a paragon of empty and vapid phrases, did nothing, nor did the production.

_Go home, Indra. Home you go._

Tip of the day for TV4: make sure the kids have access to psychologists after they leave the show because just leaving massive 'fame' can tear them up. You should know this, but judging from how much you care about their physical well-being, their mental well-being is probably just as catered for.

It's probably a dream scenario for the producers: you're not our problem anymore; toss off, please. Next! Not that it's ever been different in 'Idol'. It all reminds me of the film _Se7en_, especially the scene with [the man who was tied to a bed for a year with his tongue cut out](https://youtu.be/h8m69o_1PoQ). 'Paid his rent a year in advance. Never made noise. The perfect tenant', said Brad Pitt. Well, to TV4, these must be the perfect TV contestants: No complaints, because they don't have energy to, that is, if they're still alive to try and complain.

Let's see how many young contestants there are left to perform today, and subsequently. This is the closest to [snuff film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuff_film) as Swedish TV has come in quite some time.

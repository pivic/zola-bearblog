"\[...\] this paralytic creature \[...\]" ((This is a quote of McLaren, from the brilliant documentary about the Sex Pistols, titelled "[The Filth and The Fury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Filth_and_the_Fury)".))

[Malcolm McLaren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_McLaren) hit the nail on its head when describing Bill Grundy, a TV presenter, when he had goaded the Sex Pistols and their friends ((Notably Siouxsie Sioux.)) to swear on public TV and cause a complete storm in the magazines for days to come.

One thing about McLaren was that he was good in exploiting people and phenomena, such as the Sex Pistols, The New York Dolls and Bow Wow Wow.

When Swedish TV is now broadcasting a [Swedish version](http://www.tv3.se/projectrunwaysverige) of "**[Project Runway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Runway)**", a show that I've seen seen every single episode of so far (US version), I was not appalled at the depth and breadth the Swedish version had delved to, as the show debuted last Monday.

I was genuinely surprised.

While I knew from past experiences - notably "**[Stylisterna](http://www.kanal5play.se/program/233023/video/312022#!/program/233023)**" - that [Sofi Fahrman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofi_Fahrman), the presenter of Swe-Project Runway, is not fit to be on TV, she has outdone herself this time. Her strange tics, utterly fearful way of pronunciation words as though she were a nervous 9-year-old in school reviewing a book for her class and her bad delivery all fall into place here, together with zero charisma; her side-kick, [Rohdi Heintz](http://nyheter24.se/modette/mode/727129-intervju-med-rohdi-heintz-project-runway), seems to be a lot more in charge than Fahrman ever will be, yet comes across as a slighly shy and Gollum-ish character, while he is obviously meant to be the Swedish version of [Tim Gunn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Gunn); no such luck.

[![Rohdi Heintz: no Tim Gunn](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2012-10-08-heintz.jpg "Rohdi Heintz: no Tim Gunn")](https://niklasblog.com/?attachment_id=12060)

The quality of the Swedish version is outright worse than expected. All interviews seen on the show seem to have been executed by staffers from elementary school. The jury seem to think that being vile and outright nasty is fair and honest while offering no or little constructive criticism, as the fairly young contestants look scared and confused. I would, too, be scared and confused. It's hard to make heads or tails of the multi-confusing beast that is "Project Runway Sverige", and I will hereby prognosticate one thing: it's highly unlikely to become any better.

Seldom have I seen a show that collates incompetency with stupidity with a vapid gloss of this force, considering that **a)** the show is merely meant to be a local copy of a very successful and interesting American show that has run for loads of seasons; hence, you would think that the copy-cats should know what and how to do, and **b)** actual money has at least been thrown into this. No luck here, either.

One good thing about this is that [the premi√©re of the show bombed](http://www.resume.se/nyheter/tv/2012/10/02/ingen-succestart-for-project-runway-sverige/) with only 200K people watching. No storm followed the first episode, bar curse-words streaming from my living-room sofa. The second episode of this jest runs tonight.

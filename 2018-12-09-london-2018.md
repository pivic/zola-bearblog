    There was a lot of Beastie Boys shit in London.

    This picture is shit not good, but I wanted to show the humidity from the plants and people inside this café-cum-plant shop.

    Josh T. Pearson. This picture doesn't do him any justice, but believe me - it's hard to compare Josh's gigs with any others, really. No others that I've come across. Josh is more self-deprecating than most other musicians that I've heard live.

Life is Death.

_Josh T. Pearson in London 2018_. It was a great time of year for invigorating the senses, of lifting all spirits, for feeling the flutter of feathered wings, when getting lost in the crevasses of St Johns Church and its probable crypt, through direly scented stables, we felt exhilarated, uplifted, saddened, re-uplifted, shook up, invigorated, emotionally wondrous, beautified, maimed, killed, and revived, in what is JTP.

In all clarity: Josh can fucking write a tune. If you're in doubt, just listen to any of his shit, in solo or as part of [Lift to Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu9hP0APmc0). In May, he recorded some versions of his solo songs for the BBC. Check this for example:

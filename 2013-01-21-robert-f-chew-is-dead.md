Sadly, [the man who played Proposition Joe on "**The Wire**" is dead](http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/z-on-tv-blog/bal-proposition-joe-the-wire-robert-chew-dead-at-52-20130118,0,2016217.story).

Here's a couple of video snippets from the show, where Mr. Chew's acting talents are showcased; don't watch this if you haven't seen "The Wire" - then just go buy the entire series.

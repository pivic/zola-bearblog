On the 29th of June this year, **[LA Priest](http://earth-window.org)** will release "**[_Inji_](http://www.dominorecordco.com/uk/news/30-04-15/la-priest-announces-debut-album-inji)**", an album that I think may tip over tables. Why?

First, I heard "_Learning To Love_", this new single:

https://soundcloud.com/dominorecordco/la-priest-learning-to-love

It's a bit like an electronic rock opera as conceived by Neon Indian, old Daft Punk and Soulhack. It's groovy, glitchy and I love how it kicks into overdrive around 07:00.

Bonus: the first single from the album, "_Onio_", has a video attached:

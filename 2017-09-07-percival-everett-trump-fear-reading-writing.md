_Percival Everett with his crow, Jim, in 2002._

I just read an interview with Percival Everett in The Paris Review, issue 221, where he says a lot of interesting stuff. One of these stuffs:

> As I look back, I think that it's reading. probably even more than Writing, that I find important. Reading is subversive because you necessarily do it by yourself. Which is why books scare people like Donald Trump. What's interesting to me is that the poor people who identify With Donald Trump, they think of themselves as unlucky rich people. If things had just gone differently, they would be rich, too. The system has worked against them. It's the same reason people play the lottery. Overnight you could wake up rich, and that's an exciting thing. What you can't do overnight is become educated. That requires a lot of work, so that's not a goal. It's something to fear. But that's exactly why I find books so important. I don't care what people read. If they read anything, then they might read something else. I just want to participate in making a different culture. I'm thinking of that line of Walt Whitman'sâ€”"Produce great Persons, the rest follows." It sounds flip when you just say it, but it's true. That's not to say that people are bad, but I want a readership that wants to read things because the work is difficult, not because it's only fun. I want the fun to be in figuring it out. That's what reading is all about, and to me writing is really just an extension of reading. But there, enough of my soapbox.

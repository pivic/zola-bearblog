I like the new video. The lyrics, as always, play a part in the lives of Peter and Carlos. I mean, simple and plain, yet very _them_. Very _Pete_. And he's **back**.

I first heard this track from some live gig a month ago. It's a lot better on record.

I like Pete's action in the video as Carlos sings "I'm a bastard in the morning". They're family, this bunch of people.

_Strangely the sun still shone..._

> Woke up again To my chagrin Getting sick and tired of Feeling sick and tired again I tried to write 'Coz I got the right To make it look as if I'm doing something with my life

The entire row of lyric, and don't forget to click the lyrics that you can get explanations for, e.g. the name "gunga din". I like [Genius](http://genius.com) a lot.

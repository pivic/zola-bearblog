The 15-year-old boy who murdered Karen Aim, a backpacker in New Zealand, was sentenced last week. From [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/26/ukcrime-newzealand):

> Aim's father Brian told the court he had looked forward to walking his daughter down the aisle on her wedding day but had instead found himself walking with her coffin.
> 
> Outside the court he said he felt sorry for Broughton.
> 
> "He has taken away Karen's life, but he has also destroyed his own. "If I go down the road of anger and revenge that would only destroy my life."
> 
> Asked what sentence he thought his daughter's killer deserved, he said it was not an issue for him, adding: "It's too late, Karen is dead."

For me, this - in so few words - says all about why the death penalty is wrong.

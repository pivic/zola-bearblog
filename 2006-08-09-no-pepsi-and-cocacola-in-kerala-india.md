From [this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4776623.stm), courtesy of the BBC:

> The Indian state of Kerala has banned the production and sale of Coca Cola and Pepsi following a report that the drinks contain harmful pesticides.

Oh yes. More about how these corporations have hurt India immensely, right [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=532).

I applaud this effort, brought forward by people who love their earth, and who don't want to be slaves to a fucking piss-drink.

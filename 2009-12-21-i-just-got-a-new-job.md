This morning I signed the deal with my new employer: come March 2010, I'm moving on after six years at my current position.

Right now I'm working for the Swedish state. But as they're outsourcing every strip of IT to Volvo ((I'm not making that up.)) I've been looking for new employment; a few weeks ago I put some pep in my step on searching, and it paid off.

Following a few interviews, both over the phone and face-to-face, some checking of references and a personality test, the job is mine. My future boss seems very competent and intelligent and I'm utterly excited to start working at a new place!

I've got the feeling that 2010 will be a great year.

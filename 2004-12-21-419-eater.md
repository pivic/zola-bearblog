Ever seen an anti-419-scam-page? Check [this one](http://www.419eater.com) out. Their [trophy room](http://www.419eater.com/html/trophy_room.htm) kills me.

For those of you not in the know, 419 scams are so-called "Nigeria-mail scams", where a person pretends to be someone he/she isn't, to get a doshload of money from another person. The scammer often pretends to be from Nigeria, hence "Nigeria scams".

These people have somewhat rudimentary skills in how to get their money, but those in the trophy room weren't clever enough to avoid being scammed themselves; it is hence filled with pictures of wannabe-scammers who have been scammed back. Booyea!

**[Du Blonde](http://www.dublonde.co.uk)** is a very good artist in her own right, and if Morrissey would like to pick an artist to blow people's minds and challenge others, she would be a very good pick.

A couple of great songs from her new album, "_Welcome Back To Milk_", are found below, and don't miss another track I've previously posted [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=17291). Pre-order for the album is still - for a couple of more days, people! - available from [here](http://po.st/DuBlondeStore), and it's cheap, cheap, cheap money for signed CD/LP and an assortment of swag.

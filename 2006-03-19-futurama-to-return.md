[According to Billy West](http://www.billywest.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=2011&PN=1), who has done loads of voices for the series, [Futurama](http://www.gotfuturama.com) will soon go into production for 26 new episodes. Yee-haw!

> \[...\] they're doing 26 new episodes of ''Futurama'' for TV and we're hammering out the deal now.The original plan was to have the DVD's first but that's no longer the case.I'm totaly jammed dude.

**edit**: [Billy West has just updated the matter](http://billywest.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=2020&KW=billywest), and Futurama will only emerge as four DVD-movies, as previously planned.

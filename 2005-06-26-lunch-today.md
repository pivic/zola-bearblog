Today we went to Sk채rholmen, a suburb quite near to Fru채ngen (where we live), bought a little produce and then went home. The weather's still fantastic, so walking about was grand. I finally got to spend a 500 SKR gift cheque I was given by my parents, so I got myself a bunch of underwear.

While those are not part of [this little gallery](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-06-26) I just cobbled together, the chorizo-and-broccoli omelet is, among pictures from home and from Sk채rholmen. I feel I've gotta lose my inhibitions a bit more, loosen up, as people I don't know are always going to consider me a freak who's taking their picture. When photographing a dirty, old ice-cream cone sign at Sk채rholmen, I was asked for which magazine I was snapping pictures. Wouldn't have asked me that if I'd held my little Minolta cam, wouldya? Well, now that I've got my big, phallic camera, I can shoot everywhere. What would Freud have said about that? All sexual connotations aside, it's bloody fun to take pictures, and thank the lord for the RAW format; I still have to remember to lower the ISO-levels when out-doors, as my pictures turn a little too dark.

Now we're off to Mikaela's parents' house for a party. Her mother's birthday is here and we're invited, so let's see if I can _take more pictures_ tonight.

I was intrigued to go to the first Twin Peaks Festival ((Arranged by [this person](http://totallystockholm.se/arts-culture/fire-walk-with-me).)) when I heard they were playing the film - "**[Fire Walk With Me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks:_Fire_Walk_with_Me)**" - and I found out about the festival just as X and I had finished watching all of the TV episodes... I just came to realise it was 20 years ago (!) that I attended the Swedish premiere of the film. I recall a lot of dudes dressed as Cooper, with _one_ guy dressed as The Log Lady who of course took the fucking cake.

[Bob Engels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Engels) and [Jill Engels](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0737365) were there. Or rather, I should really Bob with a little bit of Jill, as he spoke and Jill filled in some words. She was nice, definitely. In retrospect, I wish I'd had the jive to ask her about her time as a Production Assistant at Twin Peaks; I mean, that meant she was there the whole time, during all of the recordings of the TV series. But I didn't.

Bob Engels, however, he spoke. A lot. And he was really nice, and only mentioned interesting stuff. He talked about the creative process, how David Lynch and he wrote the film together, how David Duchovny was, about Michael Ontkean's time on dope in his trailer, about how "The Fugitive" and Andy Griffith, about the owls, the old lady that peeks into the trailer at the start of the film, of how come Lynch got Dino de Laurentiis to dish the dosh for "Blue Velvet", how come "On The Air" was killed by ABC, debunking the myth on how Bob came to be... A lot of shit. Great shit.

I had no idea the man had written material for Richard Pryor! Fucking hell!

Which ties in with Pryor's appearence in "**[Lost Highway](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116922)**". He told a great anecdote about that as well, or two: one on how Pryor needed to work to receive healthcare money for battling his MS (fucking broken-assed US healthcare system) plus one on how everybody on the crew understood stuff except for Gary Busey who stormed off to his trailer.

When I first discovered Twin Peaks, I didn't realise the depth of it all. And as I was 13-15 years old, I remember thinking "Wait, David Lynch didn't write the lyrics for some songs, did he?". It was after some time that I realised how much of an auteur - rather than just being "a director", whatever my limited imagination summoned up of what that was.

Anyway, back to the festival! The ambiance was there, in the place, but the sound system was off during the film. I mean, the left speaker worked, but I've no idea of what happened to the right one and why nobody corrected it. No quality control! Still, the seminar with Bob was great.

If something more can be extracted from the festival for a 2013 (or later) return, I'd like that very much and welcome it. Oh yes. Thank you so much, all who fixed this festival together, and thank you very much, Bob and Jill Engels!

Whoa, Nelly! On the way home from work yesterday I checked out [the latest newsletter from ThingLink](http://thinglink.cmail2.com/t/ViewEmail/r/A1CE54040B246EB8/DC1B5716598E8C6B775FA7C4C6318CD9), which is a great product that enables users to spruce up images with links that often display the contents of the links without having to click them! Like, a SoundCloud link lets you play audio just by hovering the ThingLink and clicking it, flickr pics pop up automatically when hovering, et.c. It's a really cool thing and I think the only thing that so far makes up for Google's acquisition and killing of Apeture so far.

So, I checked the newsletter and they always use interesting and fancy examples of sites, but right in there, between Gucci Mane and IKEA is...my blog.

Yikes! Weird and flattering at the same time! I love the bit about "ThingLink can add depth and value to any site, no matter how many readers it has." which is true: I know my blog is read by myself and people I dread love, to their horrors, and stuff like [ThingLink](http://www.thinglink.com) really is useful. Just check out my [Best music of 2011-post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=9291); I used ThingLink to enhance the music through YouTube videos, SoundCloud links, flickr pics, homepage links, et.c.

Is this _Web 3.0_? ((Ha! I was wondering when I'd get to use that term.))

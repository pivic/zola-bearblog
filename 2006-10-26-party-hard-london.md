![Turnmills, 2006-10-28](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-10-26-turnmills.jpg)Leaving the stagnant city-life of Stockholm to my friends, I will instead leave for breadth, big city lights and...rain, in the shape of London.

Yes, dear readers, come tomorrow evening Mikaela and I are shipping off for a fun-filled weekend consisting of shopping, scones, sights and more shopping. And things like this here to the left, and if you have any kind of knowledge of popular dance music, you'll quickly recognise some of the most interesting names in there as being Funk D'Void, Krust, Dimitry From Paris, Jon Carter (aka Monkey Mafia) and Justin Roberton (aka Lionrock). Mmm-good, hauntingly so!

In celebration of this, [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?6wfqi25q15o)'s a DJ-mix by Dave Clarke, which spells _hard techno_ interlaced with heavy, at times even minimalistic house; do note how he employs filters and gizmos to cut the sound more than Jeff Mills does. Enjoy.

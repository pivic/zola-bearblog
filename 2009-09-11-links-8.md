[Speech Debelle: 'I thought it was a brilliant album'](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/sep/10/speech-debelle-mercury-prize) | Music | The Guardian (10 September 2009)

> Mercury prizewinning rapper Speech Debelle is exhausted. She won the [Mercury prize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Prize "Mercury Prize") for her debut album, Speech Therapy, less than 24 hours ago and her day is jam-packed with interviews, phone calls and taxis. "That's the first thing to have passed my lips since last night," she says, grimacing at a cup of pallid-looking coffee.

[PiL's sonic sorcery can't work without Levene and Wobble](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/sep/07/public-image-limited) | Music | guardian.co.uk (10 September 2009)

> And so the news that Lydon has reformed PiL with guitarist Lu Edmonds (who has played with the Damned and the Mekons), a multi-instrumentalist called Scott Firth, and most promisingly, Bruce Smith of post-punk/funk noir types the Pop Group on drums, doesn't excite quite as much as it would have done had Messrs Levene and Wobble been on board.

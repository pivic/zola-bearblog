[![It's Rivalbageriet strikes again](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-02-candy.gif)](https://niklasblog.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=3)Today I went to lunch with Johan, a guy from work. While working our way through the shopping-mall at Medborgarplatsen, I suddenly heard a sound of somebody crashing and saw Johan spring to action; an elderly lady had fallen backwards on an escalator, and was quickly falling further down. Her (also old) man stood above her, unable to help her. I pushed the emergency button, and sprung to her aid. Johan held her one shoulder while I held her other, trying to prevent her from falling. She was quite big, and we had the angle working against us, so we took everything very calmly while lifting her, the poor lady. I'm surprised she didn't hurt herself visibly as the fall was really loud. She was very upset, mostly frightened, but we managed to get her to sit up while people asked us if she was alright. Poor, poor lady. I felt so unable to help, yet we did everything we could to make sure if she needed an ambulance or not. She was very grateful yet I didn't feel for her well-wishing, I merely wanted to hug her and make sure she felt well again. I felt as if I wanted to help her in every way possible. Afterwards, I thought of my soon-to-be-93-years-old grand-mother, and wondered how people would treat her if she'd fallen in the same way. Probably as well as Johan and I helped this lady. Anyway, I felt a strong sense that I should have been able to do more for her after we'd left, having checked that she was able to walk, wasn't woozy, et.c. She was taken care of by her husband anyway.

So Johan and I ate at a Thai restaurant. I had chicken which was fairly good and Johan managed to bite a very strong pepper. First the lady, then him looking like he'd explode at any second, tears rolling down his red face. He calmed down after a liter of ice-water, and we went to the new public library in Medborgarplatsen. They actually had a little comics section. Reminds me I should pick up more comics. I should re-read "V For Vendetta".

I picked up ten loaves of bread from Rivalbageriet today. They were expecting me. One loaf weighs appx. 1 kg., so as I was getting ready to leave the bakery, the service-person asked me if I could carry ten loaves with one hand. "Yeah, I have a bag." Anyway, three steps outside the door and _blizzow_, the loaves become one with the street as the bag spontaneously self-combusted. "Two bags, please." Anyway, the post picture displays some goodies I bought as well. Click [here](http://www.niklasblog.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=3) to get to a gallery that shows them in detail, plus SingStar pictures from yesterday, displaying Rade and Mikaela, battling to George Michael's "Careless Whisper". I found out my voice isn't exactly made for either Mot√∂rhead's "Ace of Spades" or The Darkness' "I Believe In A Thing Called Love", but that Elvis' "Suspicious Minds" suits me well; I'd like the track to go faster though, as he played it live during his later Las Vegas dates. Anyway, Rade and I went for NBA Live 2005 like mad and...I kicked his ass in Tekken, anyway:

I'm going to bed, tired. Today's been a real hate-fest at work. All's well with our department, but a major upgrade in one of our systems went haywire, probably as the developer from the company that supplies said system didn't know what he did; every single user started calling in, and as our backup robot also fucked up, I had to handle the emergency phone. 35 calls in two hours, that's disturbing. Tomorrow's an entire day of handling said phone, so good-night.

Ah, before I finish things off, I managed to fix my network problem. Before installing WinXP SP2, I could connect two computers without a problem. Afterwards, no can do. I received a "Limited or no network connectivity" when attempting to connect them. No. [None of these things](http://www.pchell.com/support/limitedconnectivity.shtml) helped. I've scoured the web, tried hot-fixes, yet the only thing I could do was uninstall WinXP SP2 on both computers. Hey-yaa. Now everything works, though, and I can once again surf off my little laptop while at home.

To finish things off: [don't forget to watch](http://www.rotten.com/library/sex/masturbation/inventions/sex-dolls) why sex dolls aren't really sexy.

By the mad way, doesn't Ann Coulter suddenly seem [totally](http://mediamatters.org/items/rss/200503010008), [ranting](http://mediamatters.org/items/rss/200503010005) mad, as opposed to her [usual](http://mediamatters.org/items/200502280009) kind of mad?

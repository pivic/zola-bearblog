[![Phoenix](http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1361221378m/17380711.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17380711)[Phoenix](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17380711) by [Chuck Palahniuk](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2546)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/541237339)  
  
If you ask me, this is a very good and short introduction to Palahniuk for those who merely want to dip their toe in the water.

It's a very short read about the relationship in a small family, in this case two parents and one child.

There are some really scary, suspenseful, dark, sad and funny scenes in this short story, true to Palahniuk form.

A couple of quotes:

> Rachel hadn't invented the dangers of toxoplasmosis; she'd gone online and built an airtight case. This wasn't crazy talk. Neurobiologists had linked T. gondii to suicide and the onset of schizophrenia. All caused by exposure to cat poop. Some studies even suggested that the toxo brain parasites chemically coerced people to adopt more cats. Those crazy cat ladies were actually being controlled by an infection of single-cell invaders.

> “You're pregnant?“ Ted asked. He put his black napkin to his lips. To wipe them or hide them, Rachel couldn't tell.

All in all: completely worth it. I enjoyed the ending.

It's a superstar cast that makes out [Bottletop Band](http://www.bottletopband.com), but the music and humanity's in the center.

Just see the above taster!

It's a makeshift band consisting of Brazilian musicians (e.g. [Orquestra Imperial](http://www.myspace.com/orquestraimperial)), produced and actually thought out/collated by [Mario Caldato, Jr.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Caldato,_Jr.). (tightly allied with [Beastie Boys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie_Boys)) with loads of wonderful musicians, e.g. [Gruff Rhys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruff_Rhys) ([Super Furry Animals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Furry_Animals)), [Jagz Kooner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagz_Kooner) ([Primal Scream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primal_Scream) producer, electronics master), [Carl Bar√¢t](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Bar%C3%A2t) and [Gary Powell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Powell) ([The Libertines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Libertines), [Dirty Pretty Things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Pretty_Things_(band))), [Drew McConnell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McConnell) ([Babyshambles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babyshambles) guitarist), [Matt Helders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Helders) ([Arctic Monkeys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Monkeys) drummer), [Tim Burgess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Burgess) ([The Charlatans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charlatans_(British_band))), [Eliza Doolittle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliza_Doolittle), [Frank Benbini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Benbini) ([Fun Lovin' Criminals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_Lovin%27_Criminals) drummer), [Sam Duckworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Duckworth) (Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly.), [Sam Sparro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Sparrow), [Fin Greenall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_Greenall) (Fink) and [VV Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VV_Brown).

All proceeds from the sales of their coming stuff go to Bottletop charity, empowering young people and alleviating poverty across the world.

The band's single, "_The Fall of Rome_", was released in December 2010, and here it is in studio bits, so it's not the whole thing because the vid's not out:

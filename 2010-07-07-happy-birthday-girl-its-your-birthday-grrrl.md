There's so much to say but words keep failing me. Why? Simple:

The sweetest, most kind, loving, tender, funniest, smartest and loveliest person in the world celebrates her birthday today.

X, my love, my best friend and my wife.

Here's to many a wonderful birthday to come: hooray! I wish I could fully express my feelings in words but...I'll just complement that in any way I can otherwise, too.

XO, your husband.

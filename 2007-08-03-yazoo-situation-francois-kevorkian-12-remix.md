![Yazoo](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-08-03-yazoo.jpg)[Yazoo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazoo_(band)) ((Known as Yaz in the USA.)) was a duo consisting of electronica wizard Vince Clarke (formerly of Depeche Mode, nowadays in Erasure) and singer Alison Moyet.

Clarke's extremely catchy melodies coupled with Moyet's strong vocals and lyrics, often lovelorn, propelled the duo into the top of the charts. Despite being quite short-lived, the duo made a string of unforgettable singles, often topped by "Don't Go", a massive hit in Europe as well as the USA. Other favourites of mine include "Nobody's Diary", "The Other Side Of Love" and "Winter Kills". Despite what many may think, both players wrote tracks for their albums.

Speaking of success in the US, [Franà§ois Kevorkian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Kevorkian) heard Yazoo and remixed "Situation" into a 12" version, which I think is a rare example of when a remix betters the original track. It will be featured here for a week. Enjoy.

I've written a ton of topics of how Zoom abuses its company power, user privacy, and basic human decency. Now this:

I would _love_ to be a fly on the wall at Zoom. Their HR department cannot possibly even start with handling decency; things must be like during the first years at Uber or VICE. Also try to imagine being a developer or lawyer.  
  
_What shady shit shall we try to get away with today? Everything under the sun? Let's do that._

Seriously: if you've been caught installing a fucking web server on user's computers and the OS provider—Apple—had to invent a tool to disinfect users' computers from your product, you think again.

Don't go around doing the same nefarious shit over and over again, you humongous pricks. Stop it.

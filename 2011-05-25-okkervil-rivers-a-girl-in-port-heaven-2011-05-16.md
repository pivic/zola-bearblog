And as a bonus, Will playing "_A Girl In Port_" solo while in Porto San El'pidio in Italy, 2006, but with the band hanging around, throwing stuff, loafing around.

With Patrick sans beard. With Scott. And with Travis, walking next to Will who's wearing his Isaac Babel t-shirt.

Oh, nostalgia, remind me again of the trips and turns with our friends and of what is to come. Love 'em.

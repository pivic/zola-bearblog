With a bit of Fluke and meeting X too, I couldn't go wrong.

[Chutney](http://www.chutney.se/) is one of the best vegetarian lunch places in Stockholm. Evening-time it isn't as comfy-looking, but for lunch it's great. I still believe they'll let you refill your plate for free. In any case, theirs is soul-food with dark bread that'll kick your ass.

Later went to [Coffeehouse by George](http://www.bygeorge.se/), a cheapish franchise plastered throughout Stockholm. It's our Starbucks, without the veneer but with more grime and jaded staff than I saw while in the US of A. Or in England, for that matter. I'm sure CoG don't have [oompa-loompas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oompa-Loompa) in their basement, though.

Talked a whole lot about books. Andreas is well-read, so he got me stirred for [Cormac McCarthy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac%20McCarthy)'s "[Blood Meridian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%20Meridian)". And for "[The Ricky Gervais Show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky%20Gervais%20Show)" in animated shape, will have to look out for that.

Stockholm is still cold, blast. Looking out for Spring.

I have just discovered a very interesting site, courtesy of Jim Gilliam, one of the co-producers of "Outfoxed", a documentary that shows how Fox Networks turned from a real news agency into a pimp-ride for conservative right politics, after Rupert Murdoch bought the network. I've written about this documentary [twice](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=189) [before](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=228), yet it's very vital and important at the moment, as the US election date is drawing nearer.

Jim Gilliam has composed a "highlight reel" of Paul Krugman, Professor of Economics and International Affairs at Princeton University, appearing with Bill O'Reilly, compulsive liar and perhaps the biggest personality at Fox Networks. It may appear as if I let my heart lead the way when I say O'Reilly is a compulsive liar, yet it's true. If you watch "Outfoxed", you will see how Al Franken speaks of asking his own lawyer (who helped Franken win his [court case against Fox Networks](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/08/12/entertainment/main567800.shtml)) for legal advise for a man who had been grossly slandered by O'Reilly live and after that; Franken's lawyer said the only way the youth could win a court case against O'Reilly would be if he could prove O'Reilly knew he was lying. O'Reilly was obviously slandering the man, yet this is the case: as O'Reilly lies very often, it would be extremely easy for Fox to win the court case, as they could just stamp O'Reilly as a pathological liar and be rid of the case. If you're a pathological liar, you're not aware of your lying.

Anyway, the "highlight reel" ([available in two MOV-sizes here](http://www.jimgilliam.com/2004/08/krugman_vs_oreilly_my_clips.php)) mentioned above shows, among other things, how O'Reilly lies about his slandering people, how many liberals respective conservatives Fox Networks carry on their net and slanders [Media Matters](http://mediamatters.org). All of this in a few minutes!

Another interesting piece of video shows how the Outfoxed people repel O'Reilly's attacks against "Outfoxed". See the page [here](http://www.jimgilliam.com/2004/08/oreillys_smear_campaign_in_quicktime.php), as it's very interesting.

Bill O'Reilly is really just a dirty sock-puppet with interesting rhetorics. If you have never seen him in action, i.e. interacting with other people, watch the films above. Sean Hannity is another interesting character from the Fox Network. See "Outfoxed", it's well worth the [$10 it costs to purchase](http://www.outfoxed.org/Buy.php).

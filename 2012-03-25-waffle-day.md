Before I unleash a trio of pictures from today's home-made dining experience, here's an explanation about this speshul Swedish day, courtesy of [Heavy Table](http://heavytable.com/vaffeldagen-waffle-day):

> Swedes and their descendants can thank a long-ago miscommunication for Våffeldagen, the annual excuse to indulge in carb-loaded waffles topped with fruit and cream. Those particularly well-versed in the more orthodox Christian traditions may recognize tomorrow, March 25, as the Feast of the Annunciation “” the date nine months prior to Christmas which symbolizes the angel Gabriel's visit to Mary to tell her she would give birth to Jesus \[Corrected for accuracy, 3/24/11\]. In Sweden, the day was instead known as Our Lady Day (Vårfrudagen), and it was widely observed in days gone by. However, since different dialects pronounced the name differently, the altered “Våfferdagen“ was soon mistaken for “Våffeldagen“ “” and Waffle Day was born.

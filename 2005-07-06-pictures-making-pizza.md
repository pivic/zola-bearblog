Yesterday (technically) Mikaela and I made pizza. I made the tomato sauce off a recipe from a Jamie Oliver book (except we didn't use any vinegar - Mikaela tried that once and it just messed up the end result) and used our very strong chili; one small chili mixed with 1,2 liters of tomatoes, and guess who managed to lick one of his fingers after a taste? Blast! What a rush of heat. Anyway, apart from that things ran smoothly. Mikaela's known to reign when in a kitchen - in fact, that's one of the first details I got to know about her - and I said "yes, chef" a few times, hee! We had fun in the kitchen, methinks. I also made hummus using very juicy lemons - this time I only needed one, which is rare. The same goes for garlic; when using fresh garlic I use a fair-sized clove. If I use any more, the taste just dominates the completed dish entirely and you either have to start from scratch or try and smooth things over with more lemon and/or tahini.

We used basic ingredients when garnishing our two baking tins of pizza-dough: my tomato sauce, proscuitto, kalamata olives (with the pips intact, of course), red paprika, onions, sea-salt, tuna, freshly ground black peppers, mozzarella cheese, aubergine-slivers and parmesan cheese. We didn't use all of the ingredients on both, but the tuna and prosciutto ended up on different tins.

Frederic came by and had dinner with us. We all liked the pizzas, and loads of it is now cut into squares and is loaded into the fridge. Mm good, especially when you consider that our pizzas don't contain a third of the greasy fat you normally find in regular pizzas, made in restaurants. Depends on the level of seediness of the restaurant dishing out the pizza I suppose.

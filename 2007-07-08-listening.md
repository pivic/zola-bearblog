I must better myself in listening to and accepting the ways of others rather than impose my own thoughts and wishes on them. It's a matter of daring to let go and trust they're saying and doing the right things, as opposed to my thinking they could be helped by me in another way than they're saying they want to be helped; advice is good, but imposing things isn't.

I wish I weren't such a control-freak, pulling in several directions at once, trying to see the whole picture at once rather than going with the flow. I'm working on it, I really am.

30 Boxes, my favourite calendar system, has now released their own little mashup-machine. [Here](http://30boxes.com/external/widget?url=http%3A%2F%2Fniklasblog.com%2F%3Ffeed%3Drss2+http%3A%2F%2Fws.audioscrobbler.com%2F1.0%2Fuser%2Fpivic%2Frecenttracks.rss+http%3A%2F%2Fapi.flickr.com%2Fservices%2Ffeeds%2Fphotos_public.gne%3Fid%3D44124300615%40N01%26amp%3Bformat%3Datom&forceTitle=title&forceTheme=%2Ftheme%2Fsmall&forceRows=5)'s my example.

What it means, is that you can combine a number of sites and/or feeds to make up a calendar. You don't have to be a member to use this. Do it through [here](http://30boxes.com/boxed).

This is a truly wondrous article on the importance of how the story from one single person can seem and be contorted into fierce tripe when it's revealed, but when it is yet again revealed, how people can change.  
  
I cannot do this justice, nor can anybody except for its protagonist, a very, very brave person who's fought against seemingly insurmountable obstructions, mainly people around her.  
  
Go, Amber Wyatt, go.

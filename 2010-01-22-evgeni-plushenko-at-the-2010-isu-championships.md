OK. I'm still - and will forever be, dogging [X](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com) with questions on what's this, who's that - a figure-skating neophyte, but I really must write about this anyway, due to Evgeni Plushenko.

[The Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeni%20Plushenko) returns after having been on hiatus 2006-2008. How well did things turn out for him?

> At the 2010 [European Figure Skating Championships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Figure_Skating_Championships "European Figure Skating Championships") Plushenko set a new world record score in the short program by scoring 91.30 points and took first place before the free skate. (([From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeni_Plushenko#2009:_Return_to_Competition).))

He lost 40 pounds, remarried and trained. And then some.

Below's a film from Swedish TV showing how he almost completely aced his free program yesterday in Moscow, winning him the gold medal almost 12 points before [Stéphane Lambiel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane%20Lambiel), who received a truly well-deserved silver, and [Brian Joubert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%20Joubert) in third place, rightfully so. Even though Joubert should have passed out on the ice, leaving [Michal BÅ™ezina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michal%20B%C5%99ezina) - 19 years old - in third place; it would poetically have suited the former's theme with [the phoenix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology)). Or [spontaneous self-combustion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_human_combustion), I'd accept that too, yeah.

The scores from the men's finals are available [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_European_Figure_Skating_Championships#Men).

Note that after Plushenko's slip at 2:24, the Swedish commenter adds: "Oops! Even _he_ can slip up!"

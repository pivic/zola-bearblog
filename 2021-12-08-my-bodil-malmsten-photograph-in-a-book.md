One of my photographs of Bodil Malmsten is going to be published in a book.

That doesn't feel strange; what _does_ feel strange, is that Bodil is dead.

I miss her very much.

I hate the fact that grief is something I never 'get over'.

Like Blixa Bargeld once said: 'do wars ever end?'

The good part is that my memories of Bodil live on, along with her singular and beautiful writing.

I like [ForecastFox](http://forecastfox.mozdev.org), a little, yet very flexible, extension for [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html). If you're into weather forecasts...which I really am not, although it's nice to get to know the forecasts through a little pop-up window in the right-hand corner of the screen, which quickly disappears, is nice.

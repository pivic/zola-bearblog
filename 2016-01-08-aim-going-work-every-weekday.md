Tara Stiles fucking rules. The above is a very good routine for going less rigid and loosening up throughout your body, stretching everything from your hamstrings to your neck. She's got a whole slew of yoga videos available on YouTube, and I recommend them all. She's a great teacher and her routines are grand, especially for someone like me who's stuck in the whole Ashtanga Yoga trench (which is a good space to be entrenched in).

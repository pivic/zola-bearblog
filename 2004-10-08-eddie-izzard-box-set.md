I'd very much like [the new Eddie Izzard DVD box](http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=12724), but it seems it's sold out and only available for a limited period of time. I don't know if this means it will soon be available again or never again, as his site is absolute rubbish in some parts, i.e. the info. I mean, yeah, if you're searching info on what he's about for the first time in your life it's a good site, but if you're trying to see him as an intellectual being, trying to transmit his mind, thoughts and ideas through his very own internet site, it makes me envision an empty mind. Hey, he's all for the European Union (and I am most certainly _not_), but never the less he's one of my top three favourite living comedians. It's probably hard to keep it updated, but darn it, I know he uses the internet and it's full of glossy gloss, but no ready read.

[Wired reports](http://www.wired.com/news/e3/0,2879,67610,00.html) of music and/or dance games that are coming from E3. I'm looking forward to "Guitar Hero", where you can use a guitar to play the game.

Seen [Scary Girl](http://www.scarygirl.com) yet? Nice, very coloured flash comic.

Onegoodmove posts [this QT page](http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/002131.html) off Saturday Night Live, where the current American government is mocked for its fear and diversion.

[Roger Ebert reports](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050519/REVIEWS/50503002) of a few very interesting details on Star Wars 3. I think this is an utterly crappy film. Here come a few spoilers:

This film is a total clownhole. I can't bear it. Ebert says:

> The dialogue throughout the movie is once again its weakest point: The characters talk in what sounds like Basic English, without color, wit or verbal delight, as if they were channeling Berlitz. \[...\] "He's worried about you," Anakin is told at one point. "You've been under a lot of stress." Sometimes the emphasis in sentences is misplaced. During the elevator adventure in the opening rescue, we hear "Did I miss _something_?" when it should be "Did I _miss_ something?"

That's horrible, but the acting could be done better by, say, Hugh Grant, and I am implying almost every actor is stiff as a board in this film. Well, I can't blame them - the direction and script is drivel, written by somebody who seems to be surrounded by yes-sayers. It's pathetic. Sure, the film contains great effects and such, but what good is a state-of-the-art machine when a mime is steering it?

The action sequences are quite laughable. Surely, even Lucas should have learned more from all these years? No. He raped Kurosawa for the plot, and has obviously not learned anything from any other films. Oh, dread.

Alan Moore has apparently tired of being treated like an idiot so he's not with DC any more, and I think it's safe to say chances are as low as they've ever been of his collaborating with cinema people, ever. Check a very thorough list of the events, [here](http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&article=2153). He also throws up on the coming "V For Vendetta" film script:

> It was imbecilic; it had plot holes you couldn't have got away with in Whizzer And Chips in the nineteen sixties. Plot holes no one had noticed.

I hope it's going to turn out alright as a film, but really, it'll probably turn out all...Star Wars 3.

The only thing good about Star Wars is...Estar Guars. Check [this t-shirt](http://www.fabric8.com/bazaar/product.f8ml?PID=NA0103) out and you'll know what I'm writing about.

NIN are on tour, and yes, there are apparently people out there who are doing a two-part chop for the community that's interested in the shebang: 1) they're taping the shows off the soundboard and 2) releasing them as FLAC-files. What is [FLAC](http://flac.sourceforge.net)? Here:

> FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Grossly oversimplified, FLAC is similar to MP3, but lossless, meaning that audio is compressed in FLAC without any loss in quality.

So, check the bootlegs out [here](http://www.mistercooper.info). I'm not a hard-core NIN fan. I love "The Downward Spiral" and I must say the deluxe version of it is a study in how albums should be remastered and released. The demos are quite interesting, but it's the main attraction, e.g. the remastered album, that's _really_ good. Go git.

So, I haven't podcasted my Sparks thing yet. You've noticed? So, I didn't pick up my mic from work like I should have, but tomorrow's work, actually kicking things off with the emergency phone for a day, which means I'll either be a nervous wreck by the end of it, or I'll turn out OK. Moahaha. It's a karma thing, I'm sure. Then I'm surely screwed. Now to bed, ciao.

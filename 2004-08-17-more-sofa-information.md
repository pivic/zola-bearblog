Yesterday, Mikaela sent an e-mail to [Artistic Upholstry](http://www.artisticupholstery.co.uk), the company that made our Chesterfield sofa. Today, Mr. Andrew J. Mitchell from Artistic Upholstery replied, a mere few hours after she e-mailed the general e-mail address of the company! The reply was splendid, with lots of wonderful, detailed information.

Among other tidbits, we now know this sofa is 25 years old at least, that it was made by a man named Keith, and is in excellent condition. Artistic Upholstery made very few models with castors (i.e. the model of wheels our sofa carries).

Mr. Mitchell was kind enough to suggest how to renovate the sofa. We are probably going to exchange the wheels for "bun feet", in order to preserve our living-room floor.

This is wonderful. I cannot express how delighted I am by the very kind response from Artistic Upholstery. That kind of service is, I am very afraid to write, very seldom seen in Sweden, and hence comes as a shock to me, even when receiving service from abroad. I'm very much looking forward to having the sofa in our home.

[![Blixa curling](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5023/5775453284_14d85976ee.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/5775453284) _X's and my heavenly little daughter who woke me up at 6am, Sunday morning. Well, it probably was worth it._

![Babtism @ Flen](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3374/5774944467_909224a9c3.jpg) _Visiting a church in Flen, where one in the family had her hair dabbed with water. It was fun to meet that part of the family again!_

![Samba @ Björns trädgård](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2538/5774944235_8bd6b2f402.jpg) _While sitting in Björns Trädgård, waiting to go see the incredibly shitty film "The Lincoln Lawyer", some samba drum players collated and attracted a hen party. Uhngh. The samba-playing was fun for a while though._

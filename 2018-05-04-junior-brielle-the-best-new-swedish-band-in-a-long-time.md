**Junior Brielle** may be the best new Swedish band since [jj](https://ravekommissionen.blogspot.se/).

Check out their new EP, "_Blod_". It's terrific. What singing; even though the singer is reminiscent of Jocke Berg of Swedish band Kent, I'll quote a mate: "He sounds like him...but he's _good_." Also, his ability to match the very melodic music by singing is seemingly effortless, but is probably not.

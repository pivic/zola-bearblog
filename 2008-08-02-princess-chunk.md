![Princess Chunk](http://img.skitch.com/20080802-xbek76bpgg8wk3ge41f8g4ytx8.preview.jpg)  

A 44-pound stray cat has been impounded by authorities in New Jersey, USA. Said kitty has been named Princess Chunk. Naw. 44 pounds is a couple short of the Guinness world record. See a little film of the kitty [here](http://webbtv.dn.se/index.aspx?id=4101), and see more pictures of it [here](http://www.nypost.com/photos/galleries/news/regionalnews/pp_20080730_fat_cat/photo01.htm).

I hope she loses weight soon, and gets on the kitty treadmill. Work it, kittaaay!

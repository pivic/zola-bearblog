> Have you ever been this low? The taxis take you where you wanna go Broken windows, endless television shows I haven't ever been so low I am the one, I sing the song My lights are on but there's nobody home So much happening today A thousand people come and go and stay and fade away They draw the blinds and watch the show Have you ever been so low? I am the one, I sing the song My lights are on but there's nobody home ..nobody home

I've felt like this for the past days.

Some guy apparently [threw a hand-grenade at Dubya](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4701885.stm) while he was visiting Georgia, and guess what? It didn't explode as some mechanism jammed, and even if it had, it landed 30 meters from Dubya, where he was standing behind bullet-proof glass.

That, combined with the new bombs going off in London yesterday and the fact that [English police are killing suspects on subways](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4706787.stm), only makes me think that killing Dubya would only make things worse.

If you kill a dictator who claims he's against terrorism (while really supporting it, as long as his government makes money off it) it would only make him a martyr, and imagine somebody more intelligent and charismatic taking his place. Need people be reminded of a certain failed painter and artist from Austria who was at his most active during the 30's and 40's?

By the way, the English police apprehended the guy on the train, made sure he couldn't move and _then_ shot him five times? From the above BBC article:

> Stockwell passenger Mark Whitby told BBC News he had seen a man of Asian appearance shot five times by "plain-clothes police officers".
> 
> "One of them was carrying a black handgun - it looked like an automatic - they pushed him to the floor, bundled on top of him and unloaded five shots into him," he said.

Amazing. Do they really have to do that, even if he had turned out to be Dubya himself?

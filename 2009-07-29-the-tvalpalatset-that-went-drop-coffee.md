My mate Oskar is in the middle of renovating a place smack in the southern part of Stockholm city, i.e. the innards of my home town. Here, he's spent months getting a place ready as 50% office space to-let, 50% café; the office space is ready, and the café is getting ready for its premiere in August. Mind you, it's [already sneak-premiered](http://twitpic.com/89ovl)...which basically means it's open sporadically until August, when they'll be open 07:00-18:00! Bright and early.

In June, Tvålpalatset café closed down and **Drop Coffee** emerged instead. Oskar, Erik and others have spent a lot of time working on and finishing the café according to their every wish. At the time of writing, they've got a wall erected, separating the office space from the café, there's a custom-made bar practically made from scratch, a sink with functioning water running and - lo and behold - _[a brand-new coffee-machine](http://twitpic.com/bxeap)_ - but there are a lot of things waiting in the works, and I'm excited for the lads.

They've already got a lot of beans in place, the level of service, product quality and general fresh and comfortable feel of the café as a whole make me think this place could very well grow to be as lovely as Tvålpalatset was until the day it closed, rest its little soul. Drop Coffee will - apart from coffee, duh - be selling a variety of coffee-related items, e.g. [the AeroPress](http://www.aerobie.com/Products/aeropress_story.htm), beans (whole as well as ground), et.c.

Below you'll find an assortment of pictures surrounding Drop Coffee, all taken by photographer/barista [Alexander Ruas](http://www.ruas.com), who's actually created [this flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/coffeeruas/sets/72157621425549517) of pictures documenting the creation of Drop Coffee.

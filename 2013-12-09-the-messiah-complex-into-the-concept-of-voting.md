Prepare for a semi-rant. ((Alright, it's a full-blown rant.)) I should have been to see Russell Brand yesterday in Stockholm, but he's ill. So, he's infused the show onto a DVD that he's asked people to pirate, while being funny and [political](http://www.russellbrand.com/2013/11/russell-brand-we-deserve-more-from-our-democratic-system/) at the same time.

His words in the video just below this paragraph, where he meets Jeremy Paxman, ring true, and actually reinforced during said show, which I watched on TV instead of having the chance to see live. In it, Brand, with true fervour as almost emanating from Bill Hicks himself, manages to revive belief in critical thinking and also in political stance (and non-stance) as something worthwhile; are our villains mundane and our heroes flawed? Naturally. Are they Our images of them are almost always hyperbole, and as such, they always look better than they were. At least the heroes. And history is rewritten by the so-called "victors".

The above video reminds me of [Emma Goldman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Goldman)'s words on non-voting: "If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal." I agree. And [Morrissey does, too](http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_131118_01):

> Thank you to Russell Brand for standing up and speaking out in recent weeks. Like anyone who speaks out in modern Britain, he has been shot down. Nothing must interfere with the depressive psychosis of modern Britain, which has become a most violent and melancholic country, with no space for measured debate. Like Russell, I believe that the most powerful vote you can give is No Vote; for the days of Prime Ministers have gone, and it's time for a form of change that is far more meaningful than simply switching blue to red. The print media will only support people who do not matter and who are incapable of instigating thought - David 'rent-a-smile' Beckham; his wife - famous for having nothing to do; the dum dum dummies of the Katie Price set; the overweight Jamie 'Orrible, who tells us all how to eat correctly. At what point did the dis-United Kingdom become a cabbagehead nation? Where is the rich intellect of debate? Where is our Maya Angelou, our James Baldwin, our Allen Ginsberg, our Anthony Burgess, our political and social reformers? At what point did the shatterbrained scatterbrains take over - with all leading British politicians suddenly looking like extras from _Brideshead Revisited_? Although it is clear to assess the Addams Family of SW1X as the utterly useless and embarrassing ambassadors of a sinking England, how can we effect change without being tear-gassed? In the absence of democracy, _there is no way_.

Also, from Noam Chomsky (in [this interview](http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20040714.htm) with Ziga Volovnik):

> **ZV**: Do you go to the polls/ Do you vote?
> 
> **NC**: Sometimes. Again, it depends on whether there is a choice worth making, whether the effect of voting is significant enough so it is worth the time and effort. On local issues I almost always vote.

And if thoughts of fear creep in as Brand points out that [147 corporation own half of the monetary wealth in the world](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/10/22/the-147-companies-that-control-everything), just remember (before you revolt, as you should): it's just a ride.

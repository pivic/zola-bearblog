We've just come to terms with why London police executed a man in the municipal subway system, yesterday evening:

[The man had nothing to do with what made police murder him](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4711021.stm).

[According to the Financial Times](http://news.ft.com/cms/s/eef42738-fa78-11d9-a0f6-00000e2511c8.html), police are now instructed to aim for the head (instead of the body, as they have in the past) when attempting to stop suspected terrorists, as they may otherwise set off explosives. Well, no explosives went off this time! Guess why?

Ken Livingstone, mayor of London, warns that the terrorists may choose "a new target" next time. Hence, my advice to anybody living in London is: don't run on your way to the train, and if you must, be sure to wear a kevlar-cased, hollow-point-secured helmet.

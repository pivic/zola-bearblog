Here's a little interesting post.

While consuming candy yesterday, my wife and I opened a box of M&M's, where we found one to contain something other than peanuts and chocolate:

I still shudder at the idea of what the hell that really is. Here's a video of it:

I've reached out to M&M's in Sweden and in the USA, but no reply as of yet.

[M&Ms Sverige](https://www.facebook.com/mmssverige) have replied to [my post on their Facebook timeline](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151812131136236&set=o.240959602649981&type=1):

> Hej Niklas! Vi beklagar verkligen att det här har hänt dig och vi tar inte lätt på att sånt här händer. Vi vill gärna att du skickar ett privat meddelande till oss med dina kontaktupplysningar så att vi kan reda ut detta. Vi vill igen beklaga det inträffade. MVH M&M'S ® M&M's Sverige

Translates to:

> Hi Niklas! We really regret that this has happened to you and we don't take these things lightly. We would like that you send us a private message with your contact information so that we can sort this out. We would again really want to say that we are sorry for what has happened. Best, M&M'S ® M&M's Sweden

I've answered them, and I hope they'll contact me very soon enough...

Yeay, they sent me [an insincere apology letter](https://niklasblog.com/?p=14147) yesterday! Yuck. Tastes foul.

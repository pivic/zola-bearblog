Hey, ya! Just before heading off to Way Out West and oblivion, I'm posting a new installment of my muxtape, available by clicking [here](http://pivic.muxtape.com). At the end of this run-down you'll find yours truly explaining a little more about the tracks in video.

I didn't expect there to be a red thread through some of the tracks, but unconsciously there is: Ramones - Ronnie Spector - The Primitives. Not very hard to see once you research the tracks involved, provided you're a nerd like me. Here's the list of what's been cooked:

1\. **R.E.M.** - "Crush With Eyeliner"

In my mind, "Monster" - where this track is from - is the band's most underestimated album. I love the feedback on this track, and don't miss Thurston Moore's ((Yeah, from Sonic Youth.)) solo.

2\. **Elliott Smith** - "Independence Day"

Showing how quiet can be loud, Smith truly rocked my world with this track, yet again showing how extremely high he sets the bar despite obvious references from The Beatles. This is original and strong on all levels. I've rarely come across such a singer/guitar-player/lyricist/arranger/writer in one person.

3\. **Ramones** - "Rockaway Beach"

"Someone asked Johnny Ramone once why the songs were so short. He said they were actually fairly long songs, played very very quickly." -->Eddie Vedder. ((From [Vedder's Hall of Fame induction speech](http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/PearlJam/echoes/hoframones.html).))

4\. **Asobi Seksu** - "Strawberries"

The band once most likely to pick up the strength that My Bloody Valentine once had, they're very worth checking out; most of their tracks aren't this clean, i.e. undistorted, and they've got talent.

5\. **Ronnie Spector** - "You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory"

Written by Johnny Thunders, it's here covered by Spector - the former [Ronette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ronettes) - with [Joey Ramone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Ramone).

6\. **Dirty Pretty Things** - "Chinese Dogs"

I feel this track is long, even though it's only 3:31. It sticks with me, yet I cannot tell why.

7\. **The Primitives** - "Stop Killing Me"

Jangly and fast, to me, this band is like a mix of Ramones and The Ronettes. A great trip. I love the sha-la-la backing vocals.

8\. **David Bowie** - "Cygnet Committee"

A slightly dystopian view from Bowie's second album, this is a long track showing his discomfort with the present yet wishing for change. From the song:

> And I open my eyes to look around And I see a child laid slain on the ground As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command But not hearing anymore Not hearing anymore Just the shrieks from the old rich
> 
> And I Want to Believe In the madness that calls now And I want to Believe That a light's shining through Somehow

9\. **Belle & Sebastian** - "Gigantic \[live\]"

The gang's covering Pixies' old classic, as written by Kim Deal, there's nothing not to love here.

10\. **Front 242** - "Im Rhythmus Bleiben"

These lads had a keen sense of humor, which is obviously seen in the video for another track, "_Headhunter_". With this in mind, stay in the rhythm. It's almost funny to hear such cold, hard lyrics and sounds telling you to be in rhythm, but at the same time minimalistic, clinical and funky. Very Kraftwerkish.

11\. **Cansei De Ser Sexy** - "Rat Is Dead (Rage)"

I didn't get into CSS' first album, "Cansei De Ser Sexy", much. I don't really know why. I just liked Bonde Do Role a lot more. Anyway, their latest album, "Donkey" rocks my world. It's more mature, yet still very playful, rocky and electronic. This is the first single off the album and I love it. The song and guitar in the chorus kicks me into overdrive.

12\. **Elvis Costello** - "She"

> Me, I'll take the laughter and your tears And make them all my souvenirs And when she goes I've got to be The meaning of my life is She....She Oh, she....

Very schmaltzy, very nicely composed.

As promised, here's my face telling you a tad more about the tracks.

![Simian Mobile Disco](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-06-09-simianmobiledisco.jpg)I've liked [Simian Mobile Disco](http://www.simianmobiledisco.co.uk) for a while, and have even had the pleasure to experience them live. I think their debut album, "Attack Sustain Decay Release", was [one of the best albums of 2007](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1385).

One of the best tracks of that year is "_Hustler_", which is featured on "Sample And Hold", the band's coming remix album; it's a remixed version of their debut, where every track is remixed by a different artist.

More of the remixes can be previewed [here](http://www.wavesatnight.com/2008/06/07/boyohboyohboy). And if you like [Joakim](http://www.joakimikaoj.com), consider downloading [this "cosmic laidback mix"](http://www.versatilerecords.com/joakim/audio/Rodeomix.mp3) live @ Berns, Stockholm, in 2007.

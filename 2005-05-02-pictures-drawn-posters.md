Today I've taken a whole bunch of pictures, which you can find [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-05-02). I went to work today, which was a lot of fun! I've snapped loads of pictures, by the way. I think I'm both getting better at understanding the camera and at not keeping as many pictures as I previously have, as time passes, and it's really heaven and hell when it comes to understanding the blasted thing. I'm now convinced I have to buy the Nikon D70s. It's just a matter of time (but really, money) before I do.

I'm going to try and use [MindManager X5 Pro](http://www.mindjet.com/eu/products/mindmanager_x5pro) for a bit. This is a mind-mapping software that helps you to collect rampant thought-processes, brain-storming sessions and a way to sort muddled thoughts out. Let's just see how it turns out! It looks very promising, providing snazzy MS Office-integration.

Today, [Drawn!](http://drawn.ca) posted a link about [Drew Struzan](http://www.drewstruzan.com), one of the best poster-artists ever, in my opinion. I think my judgment may be affected from all the excitement I always felt as a young boy, whenever and wherever I would see a Struzan poster: at the cinema, going to rent a video-tape, et.c. As poster-artists are getting fewer and fewer, Struzan still lives on, due to his cool (and, one must admit, commercial) style of drawing. His posters of "Blade Runner" and the Indiana Jones films will always clearly stick in my mind. Check his site out, and when you're there, most importantly, his portfolio.

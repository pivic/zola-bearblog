![Saul Williams](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-10-31-saulwilliams.jpg)[Saul Williams](http://www.saulwilliams.com), rightfully lauded spoken-word artist and recording artist, will tomorrow release his new album, _The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust!_. It's produced by [Trent Reznor](http://nin.com) and mixed by [Alan Moulder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Moulder). It will be available just like Radiohead's new album, meaning you can download it for free if you want, but if you want to pay for it - as much as you want - you can download it in a lot better formats than Radiohead's 160Kbps MP3:

> “¢ 192Kbps MP3 “¢ 320Kbps MP3 “¢ FLAC lossless audio
> 
> If you choose not to pay for the record, you will receive it in 192Kbps MP3 format.
> 
> All versions include a PDF with artwork and lyrics
> 
> All files are 100% DRM free, and can be played on any device. MP3s are encoded with LAME v3.97 and love.

[Here](http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/10/trent_reznor_and_saul_williams.html)'s a fresh interview with Saul Williams and Trent Reznor who are discussing the new album, the demise of OiNK's Pink Palace and, subsequently and expectedly, the fall of the recording industry model as we traditionally know it.

If you haven't heard his previous album, titelled _Saul Williams_, you should check it out as soon as possible. The track "List of Demands" is available for you to download/listen to at the bottom of this post, and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1llNYAlYrc)'s the video.

Speaking of this track, Saul Williams has influenced a lot of people with it. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEvxsu9aeQQ)'s a video of [Robyn](http://www.myspace.com/robynmyspace) performing the track with [Jenny Wilson](http://www.jennywilson.net) (song and piano only), and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu4XawBelwg)'s another video of The Hives covering it.

Here's the track and as usual, it will be removed after a week has passed.

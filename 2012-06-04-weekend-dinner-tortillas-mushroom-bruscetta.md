Made a couple of tasty - if I may say so myself, and I do - dishes this weekend, which may perhaps not look as appealing to the human eye through the lense of a shitty mobile phone, but to serve the memory and make you, the noble viewer, think "Hell, I could outdo that with a bucket of tar and some human flesh, ahoy!" ((I've no idea how you, said noble reader, turned pirate.)):

Mmm! Yes, tortillas wrapped with stuff like pan-fried tofu and lime-infused avocado inside a crusty shell of home-made tomato-sauce, garnished with cheese.

Or perhaps a little bruschetta with mushrooms which have been fried in a white wine-and-onion jus?

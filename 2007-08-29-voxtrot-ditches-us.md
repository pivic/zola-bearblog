![2007-08-29-novox.jpg](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-08-29-novox.jpg)A couple of months ago I wrote about [Voxtrot playing Pop Dakar](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1294) and how I screamed aloud at that. With only three days to go until that gig, they've ditched us in favour of opening for [Arctic Monkeys](http://www.arcticmonkeys.com) on their tour of America.

My first response: "They're shitting on us in order to get big."

Of course, I understand them. They want to get more publicity and hence, sell records, which is not a bad thing altogether; they need money to keep the band running. On the other hand, I feel like I'm getting treated like a god-damned step child, to [paraphrase Ice Cube](http://song-lyrics-library.com/ice_cube/ice-cube-the-nigga-ya-love-to-hate-song-lyrics.html).

Voxtrot have cancelled the rest of their European dates and their West Coast tour of America to support the Monkeys. The one thing they should do - if you ask me - is reschedule the cancelled dates as soon as humanly possible to show their support for their fans.

I'm sour grapes and feeling disappointed right now; I feel as if a friend's sucker-punched me and headed for the hills. I'll probably drown my sorrows by watching "[The Bridge](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0799954)" tonight.

From the film "_[Thirst](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0762073)_":

> **priest**: Those who seek direct communication with God are prone to self-hatred. The Devil will eat right into you. As St. Bruno said, 'Suicide is to die a martyr for Satan.' It's worse than first degree murder. It's worth a life sentence...in Hell. Twenty Hail Mary's, get lots of sun and take a cold shower. Get God's help through science and take some anti-depressants. Stop thinking about killing yourself. And...forget the bastard who dumped you.
> 
> **woman**: Father...I'll deal with the bastards and the worldly matters. You just stick to praying, Father.

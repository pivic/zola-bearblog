I still haven't received any word from Engstr√∂m Telecom regarding my busted telephone, so I called them myself, today. To make a long story short (well, it's really quite [on the elongated side](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=421) already) they first asked me for the unique service number which I gave them, and then was told "Here it says: changed spool, was to be picked up on the 29th of December." to which I replied "Yes, but the telephone was then still busted, then I was told to pick it up the next day so I came, but the phone wasn't fixed, and I was told it'd appear at my home on Monday or Tuesday, and that's a few days ago now", to which I got the following: "Well, the technician is on vacation today, so I can't really help you."

Radiant. I've been promised a call from said technician come Monday. Do you think it will happen? I really do! Either I'm just dumb or it will happen. Come ooon.

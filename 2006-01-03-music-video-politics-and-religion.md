Thanks to [Sex](http://www.tidningensex.se) (the Swedish paper, which, of course, has nothing to do with the old in-and-out) I've discovered a laudable online purveyor of music. I'm writing about [Dotshop.se](http://dotshop.se), where I today ordered [Lightning Bolt](http://laserbeast.com)'s latest album. They've got a lot of interesting music up. And support your local good record-retailer, kids!

Speaking of which, isn't it miraculous that the big four of the music business, Warner Music Group, EMI Group, Sony BMG and Universal Music, are yet again [getting sued for having formed cartels](http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-fi-warner24dec24,0,3015790.story)? The wheels of the cartel go round and round... From the LA Times article:

> Warner Music Group disclosed Friday that it had received subpoenas from the New York attorney general as part of an industrywide probe into how much record companies charge for digital music. \[...\] Wholesale digital music prices can range from 60 cents to nearly 90 cents a song, according to industry executives. Operations such as Apple Computer Inc.'s iTunes, the most popular digital music source, then sell songs to users for 99 cents per download. \[...\] Companies want songs from popular artists such as Green Day to fetch more than those of lesser acts. Sources say that proving price fixing is difficult because it requires not only showing that the music companies charge similar prices, but that they secretly agreed to do so.

How very nice. To add to this utter state of dreadfulness, from the same article:

> In 2003, companies settled a price-fixing suit involving CD sales spearheaded by a group of state attorneys general. The companies paid $67.4 million in cash to consumers and donated $75.7 million worth of CDs to libraries and schools. Critics said the settlement allowed companies to dump CDs they couldn't sell anyway, rather than donate quality music. Spitzer already has been investigating music company for allegedly lavishing gifts on radio station employees to influence playlists. Warner Music agreed to pay $5 million to settle charges; Sony BMG agreed to pay $10 million. EMI and Universal are still being investigated.

I'm happy that [some people are watching the watchmen](http://www.billboardliberation.com/2005/12/29/watching-the-watchers).

Speaking of which, rumours are spreading, saying [Google are ready to get into the PC retailing game](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-predict1jan01,0,3503327.story).

**edit**: Google has, after this post was written, denied these rumours to be true. More about that is found [here](http://hardware.silicon.com/desktops/0,39024645,39155344,00.htm).

Hang on. Have I written about their totalitarian take [before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=638)? Some say that well, at least they're not Microsoft. Yeah, but Pol Pot wasn't George W. Bush, so shut your faces: two wrongs don't make a right. I'm saying that it's good that Microsoft, the biggest company on the planet (commercially speaking), is getting to feel real competition, but on the other hand, I dislike other competitiors getting the short end of the stick. Somehow, [due to experience](http://www.google.se/search?q=microsoft+buys+companies&btnG=Search), I have the feeling that Microsoft have already tried to out-buy Google - or that vice versa will be the case in a while. Imagine the size of _that_ company.

Speaking of the powers that be, check [this article](http://www.onlisareinsradar.com/archives/002544.php) out, and you might get a whole slew of uncomfortable, wonderful political truths.

And if you like uncomfortable truths, there's [a huge reason](http://www.slumdance.com/blogs/brian_flemming/archives/001907.html) to why you'll love the Swedish denim-maker Cheap Monday.

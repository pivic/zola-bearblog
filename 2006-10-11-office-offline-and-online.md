Microsoft has just broken their previous record by [releasing 26 patches](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/10/microsoft_updates_fix_26_secur.html) to mend Windows XP, Microsoft Office 2003 and so forth.

Speaking of Office, Microsoft have released the second "technical release" of [Office 2007](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/default.mspx), and are expecting it to reach gold (i.e. be ready for release, only requiring minor changes until ship date); if the suite will have no more delays it will ship in January 2007, which cannot be said for the Macintosh version; [Office 2007 for OSX will ship 8 months after the Windows-version](http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&id=35522). Sour grapes, Steve J, but you can always use one of the six [free Google tools for OSX](http://www.google.com/mac.html).

So, what if you want to use Office online? [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com). Yeah, Google has now merged the word-processor formerly known as Writely with their own spreadsheet service, and are calling it Google Docs. More about [Google Docs at TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/10/google-docs-spreadsheets-launches/), with words on Zoho as competitor.

By no way, you may have noticed that I've removed my [social bookmarks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking) from every post. This is because I have smelled the coffee and realised they 1) won't be convincing people to use them and 2) those in the know will use other methods if they really think a post is interesting enough. I promise, I removed them before reading [this post](http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2006/10/10/mooching_20).

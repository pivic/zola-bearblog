Greg Palast is releasing "[Bush Family Fortunes](http://www.gregpalast.com/bff-dvd.htm)", a story of how the Bush administration came to power by republican agents purchasing the last US election. More on Palast's view can be read [here](http://www.gregpalast.com/detail.cfm?artid=15&row=2).

I have not seen this documentary, but I think it'll be interesting.

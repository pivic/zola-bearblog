This weekend was calm.

Missed out on meeting Ida for a day at Fotografiska, due to illness. Still, the day after we met Malin and Bobby for some Antonioni extravaganza. It's been such a long time since we last met and I was really happy to meet them. X killed me at a board game about Norrk√∂ping, and then our beloved guests arrived. We talked and talked and I loved it. Talked over "_[L'Eclisse](http://www.criterion.com/films/928-l-eclisse)_", which I think actually improved the film. I'm not dissing it! It was a really good film, and it's one of those which may be great, may be crap depending on your mood at the time. I think I may have missed some parts of it, but in actuality, it was almost as plot-free as Antonioni's "[_L'Avventura_](http://www.criterion.com/films/209-l-avventura)", one of my fave films.

M&Ms were consumed. Wine was drunk. Everything was calm. Briliant.

Soon it's time for [**Primavera Sound 2013**](http://www.primaverasound.es/?lang=en). God! I'm not prepared! On the flipside, I'm never prepared, and yet our trips turn out planned anyway. I mean, as planned as I like them to be. I seldom care for pre-planning in any way. Let shit happen as it does! With that roster of artists, I don't really care. Just as long as I catch The Jesus & Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine, I'm good to go. And Swans. And Dexys. And...and. And. Barcelona. Please, take me away.

Let the trip be as fluid and lucid as "_[Lost In Translation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266)_". I love that film. Kevin Shields curated that soundtrack and bless him for it.

Speaking of nothing, I started my subscription to [**MistoBox**](fbuy.me/b61z) today. 15 USD per month (100 SEK) with postage & packing included, for four coffee bags per month! That's lovely. Granted, the bags are not big, but they're from different suppliers every month. Check it out [here](fbuy.me/b61z). A little informational vid on it here:

Now it's time to get back to the couch. I'm gonna start blogging more personal shit, even though the above was a lot of materialistic stuff, but at the same time, I want to allow myself to go there, too. So go forth and procrastinate.

Oh and I've just written [We Come From Wood](http://fromwood.se/), the production company that make "En stark resa med Morgan och Ola-Conny". Absolutely brilliant, that series. I've asked if there's a tee or tote bag available. No, it's not slapstick or schadenfreude. It's fun.

Oh, this is fun:

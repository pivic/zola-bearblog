[Here](http://rion.nu/v5/archive/000942.php) are a bunch of wonderful pictures of cosplay'd-out girls from Harajuku. Be sure to visit [rion's site](http://rion.nu) for brilliant pictures from Japan.

Even though I'm sure I've mailed loads about this, you've gotta check [this Boing Boing article](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/08/teenagers_camera_fac.html) on amazing birthday pictures from a Brazilian girl's 15th birthday. Her facial expression reminds me of a lot of Aphex Twin videos.

[Here's](http://www.primalscreamremixed.com) a site offering Primal Scream's masterpiece "Screamadelica", but remixed. I haven't heard it yet.

Get yourself a [portable Firefox](
http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/portable_firefox), i.e. a version of [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/start) that runs from a USB memory, at appx. 5MB in size.

Films. [Here's one](http://www.compfused.com/directlink/746) showing Crispin Glover at David Letterman's show, utterly insane. Quite funny, and quite tragic. [Here](http://www.compfused.com/directlink/739)'s another film displaying idiots as they use too much gasoline on a bonfire before ignition-time. The soundtrack is great on that one. [This](http://www.compfused.com/directlink/765) little piece shows fainting goats. Poor, nervous goats! [Here](http://www.compfused.com/directlink/728)'s a flying dog. [Ova hea](http://www.compfused.com/directlink/715) you'll find a guy who's really brave, into maths, and musicals. But don't forget how devastatingly bizarre Japanese fights can be. Round ball versus man [here](http://www.compfused.com/directlink/676)! Last, don't you wish your local weather-person could be just like [this weather-man from Fox](http://www.compfused.com/directlink/605)? Tourette's?

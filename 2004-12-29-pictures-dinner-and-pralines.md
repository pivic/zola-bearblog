[Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-12-30) are a few pictures from two occations during the past days. One's featuring Frederic and Mikaela at M's and my home, where she made the most wonderful beef stew using some peculiar, very juicy spices. The other one displays some pralines that I purchased today at [Chokladfabriken](http://www.alltomstockholm.se/E/V/STOSE/0004/48/30/), the foremost chocolate-makers in Stockholm. I must say the saffron praline was delicious, also the whisky one, but the calvados pralines, which were supposed to contain liquid calvados - were empty! Anyway, time to go to bed now and prepare for the last day of work before my one-week vacation, starting tomorrow. Yah!

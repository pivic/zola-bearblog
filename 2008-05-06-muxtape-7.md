Here's the seventh installment of my muxtape, and you'll play it [here](http://pivic.muxtape.com).

Crikey! What happened to installment six? It went and gone. I uploaded the files, but didn't write anything about it. Anyway, here's a nice little assortment of quirky, lovely and angry tracks for you.

1\. **Laurie Johnson** - "Theme from The Avengers"

I didn't mean for this to be another _Theme from_, but it just turned out that way. Even though I really wanted "[Theme from The Persuaders](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2qGPWMt5ro)", this is infinitely cheesier, which I think works better on another level with the hard beautiful shell that is

2\. **My Bloody Valentine** - "Sometimes"

This track is in modern times probably most well known for being featured in the wonderful film "[Lost in Translation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266)", which Kevin Shields ((The founder and musical genius of My Bloody Valentine.)) curated, musically speaking, with Sofia Coppola. This track serves to prove why "_[Loveless](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:d9frxqw5ldse)_" is one of my favourite albums ever; incidentally, it's one of the albums I've always heard is great, but took the most number of listens before I could even call it listenable. These days, I couldn't consider parting from it.

3\. **Scout Niblett** - "Lullaby For Neptune in 10 Years"

Speaking of genius, to me, [Scout Niblett](http://www.scoutniblett.com) is a magnificent artist, an ardent follower of doing things her own way. Reminiscent to Kurt Cobain (who musically convinced Niblett to create music of her own), this fantastic track kicks ass in an artistic and a get-your-rocks-off way. And yes, [I've podcast this song](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1022) more than two years ago. It's produced by Steve Albini, damn it, so notice how the drums are in the forefront during the chorus. Beauty.

4\. **Body Count** - "There Goes The Neighborhood"

> _There goes the neighborhood. Here come them fuckin' niggas with their fancy cars. Who gave them fuckin' niggas those rock guitars? Who let 'em in the club? Did you make 'em pay? Who let 'em on the stage? Whose lettin' 'em play? Don't they know rock's just for whites don't they know the rules? Those niggers are too hard core this shit ain't cool._

I love the album "Body Count"; during the early 90's, Ice-T had the audacity to make a hardcore rock album with punk ethics, compiling lyrics about everything from racism to sexism; some people hate their debut record, while it's one of the very few of the genre that make me want to get stupid in every sense.

5\. **Rage Against the Machine** - "Know Your Enemy"

Even though this is also hardcore, it's a lot better produced than the Body Count-track mentioned above; Zach de la Rocha is another vocalist, really knowing how to phrase his vocals, not to mention Tom Morello's trademark style of guitar-playing, et.c. This is an extremely tight band.

Bonus trivia: RATM's song "Bombtrack" has inadvertedly spawned [the funniest funeral ever](http://bash.org/?572589).

6\. **Tony Hatch** - "Emmerdale Farm"

Yes, it's the theme song for Emmerdale Farm - so what? It's pretty! It's swooning, seemingly made for pensioners sailing on their solemn way towards death by TV. A big nod towards Francis Lai and Georges Delerue.

7\. **Whale** - "Pay For Me"

This is a Swedish band from the 90's, consisting of a TV show-host, a comedian and a record producer. Still, they did rock. [The video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwujYHLJay4) is Jonas Ã¥kerlund's first. The sung lines "_For God's sake/Jesus_" is genius.

8\. **Atari Teenage Riot** - "Kids Are United"

Since Swedish company KPA started pimping the classic track "Kids Are United" by Sham 69, I remembered Atari Teenage Riot's take on it, and here it is. Guitars are mashed by samplers and gabber urban warfare, proving founding ATR member Alec Empire's point that riot sounds can indeed produce riots. When Thurston Moore ((Founding member, singer and guitarist in Sonic Youth.)) heard ATR, he famously said he wanted to discard his guitar and pick up a sampler instead.

Here's the commercial by KPA, by the way.

9\. **Dinosaur Jr.** - "Sludgefest"

As ATR have sampled this track by this American drone-band, I thought of including it. Either you love or hate it, as with most of Dinosaur Jr.'s music; it took me a long time to get around listening to "_[You're Living All Over Me](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fifwxqr5ldfe)_", but every strain was worth it. I love J. Mascis' guitar-solo.

10\. **Depth Charge** - "Shaolin Buddha Finger"

English, big-beat classicism, 90's, kung fu-flick-samples, hip-hop-worshipping. Differs a lot from the rest of the tracks on this mix.

11\. **Rah Band** - "Clouds Across The Moon"

This is the first song I ever downloaded using Napster, which took me 9 hours through dial-up. Worth it? You bet. I always think of Douglas Adams' "[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)" when hearing it; oh, the harrowing tale of love lost through a broken intergalactic phone-line: _Next year...next year...next year._

12\. **Filter** - "Hey Man, Nice Shot"

Having played guitar with Nine Inch Nails for a long time, [Richard Patrick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Patrick) left the band during the recording of "_[The Downward Spiral](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:09ftxqysldse)_" and formed Filter, which released its debut album in 1995. This is their debut single, which is inspired by Bud Dwyer's way of ending his life.

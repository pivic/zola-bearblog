Yeah, [it's soon for sale in Japan](http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/040921/sftu069b_1.html), but it's network ready and just a fourth as big as its father, the plain old PS2. I want one! Anyway, a network interface for my PS2 isn't expensive, so I'll get myself that after the next salary. Maybe. And then I'll get [NBA Live 2005](http://www.easports.com/games/nbalive2005/home.jsp) and just float into oblivion. Well not really. Mibee.

Or I could just [get myself HAL](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3840166200&category=60360&ssPageName=ADME:B:EF:US:1#ebayphotohosting) off "2001"!

Update: [here are more pictures](http://www.engadget.com/entry/8413288107686276). It looks like an IBM ThinkPad from the rear!

> you'll never believe me, so why don't you find out for yourself sick down to my heart that's just the way it goes

A few years ago I was a staunch Morrissey supporter. I adore a lot of his comments and interviews from back in the day, and I love a lot of his older music. I'll always treasure "_Vauxhall & I_" as a complete masterpiece. 

However, the music and his past beautiful words are not all. Far from it. During the last few years he's reared another head entirely, making myself wonder about older statements and lyrics as well. Suddenly, even older lyrics are reconsidered in a bad way ((For example "[_Asian Rut_](https://genius.com/Morrissey-asian-rut-lyrics)".)).

He has given way to cowardly flaunting islamophobia (seemingly even so far so that his superfan Julia no longer updates [her Morrissey site](http://true-to-you.net)), antifeministic statements (preferably in his autobiography, calling women who made him uncomfortable "fatties"), exclaiming Ukip's Nigel Farage as "a great educator" and ending the last song on his latest album by hailing the apartheid Israeli government.

Morrissey used to be one of the few shining celebrity stars to me. I loved him, I really did. But one has to keep thinking, and that's why I cannot bear his hateful self since some time back.

On Saturday, [Der Spiegel published an interview with Morrissey](http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/morrissey-ueber-brexit-kevin-spacey-und-merkels-fluechtlingspolitik-a-1178545.html). In it, he states that Berlin is a "rape capital" because of its open borders, then further idiotically states this, which is culled from [this article](https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/11/morrissey-had-some-dumb-shit-to-say-in-defense-of-kevin-spacey-and-harvey-weinstein):

> “Anyone who has ever said to someone else, “I like you,” is suddenly being charged with sexual harassment. You have to put these things in the right relations. If I can not tell anyone that I like him, how should he ever know?” Morrissey griped in response to a question about the ongoing #MeToo campaign.
> 
> He was then asked specifically about Kevin Spacey, who has been accused of sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old boy. In Morrissey’s opinion, the outrage should be focused on the boy and his parents.
> 
> “\[I\] was wondering where the boy’s parents were. One wonders if the boy did not know what could happen. I do not know about you, but I’ve never been in situations like this in my youth. Never. I always knew what could happen. When you are in somebody’s bedroom, you have to be aware of where that can lead to. That’s why it does not sound very credible to me. It seems to me Spacey has been unnecessarily attacked.”
> 
> Similarly, he believes Weinstein’s multitude of accusers are at fault because “they play\[ed\] along.”
> 
> “People know exactly what happens. And they play along. Afterward, they feel embarrassed, or they do not like it. And then they turn it around and say: ‘I was attacked, I was surprised, I was dragged into the room.’ But if everything had gone well and had it given them a great career, they would not talk about it. I hate rape. I hate attacks. I hate sexual situations that are forced on someone. But in many cases, one looks at the circumstances and thinks that the person referred to as a victim is merely disappointed. Throughout the history of music and rock ‘n’ roll there have been musicians who have slept with their groupies. If you go through history, almost everyone is guilty of sleeping with minors.”

I don't believe that Der Spiegel made the above up nor that things have been lost in translation.

In May of 2017, Martin Rossiter, notable frontman of now-defunct band Gene, wrote [this good article for The Quietus](http://thequietus.com/articles/22503-morrissey-islamophobia-martin-rossiter-gene) where he clarifies why Morrissey is now dead to him; I recommend reading his writing. From the article:

> I feel ashamed and embarrassed that I quietly remained a Morrissey apologist for many years. I didn't want to admit that someone who wrote songs that helped me in my youth could become an alt-right poster boy. I stopped buying his singles years ago but continued buying albums until 2009. My group Gene also supported him in 2004 at the Meltdown Festival. I really wish I had been as convicted as I am now and refused to share a platform with him. For that I am truly sorry.

Also:

> With songs like 'Asian Rut' and 'National Front Disco' (which contains the repeated line, "England for the English") Morrissey has skirted around the subject of POC in the UK, but both songs are lyrically too opaque to draw concrete conclusions. Either way he seems determined to dip his quill in that particular inkwell.
> 
> More importantly in recent years, are some of Morrissey's comments in interviews. He's said the following:
> 
> - "If you walk through Knightsbridge on any bland day of the week you won't hear an English accent."
> - Talking about the Jimmy Savile abuse investigation, saying: "2013 enlightenment can't be applied to dark and dim nights of 1972, otherwise every singer who ever slept with a 14-year-old would suddenly be behind bars – and that would take a lot of bars"
> - To _Q_ magazine he said he didn't "really think, for instance, black people and white people will ever really get on or like each other."
> - He described the Chinese as a "sub-species"

How the mighty has fallen.

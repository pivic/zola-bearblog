Of late I have often found myself fragmented enough not to blog here. Instead, I have posted my mind on [my tumblr-blog](http://tumblr.pivic.com). You didn't even know I had one, right? Ha, it's new.

So, what's tumblr? It's a hosted ((Meaning you can't download and install it.)) miniblog system, aimed at people who either want to use it as a funnel for all types of [feeds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)), those who want to blog but keep it short ((And [Bog](http://astro.imperial.ac.uk/~vaccari/mis/nadsat.html) knows I'm one of those people at times.)) . Or both. Read all about tumblr [here](http://lifehacker.com/software/web-publishing/geek-to-live--instant-no+overhead-blog-with-tumblr-244915.php).

But why start one? Because it's made for small things. You enter something little, e.g. a quote, a YouTube-clip, a link or a picture. Tumblr then interprets the info and displays it nicely; for instance, when you add a link to a picture, the tumblr-server downloads and saves it, so you won't have to care if the original's gone.

And you can let tumblr import your other feeds and display them quite nicely: a flickr-picture is resized to fit and chronologically inserted among your other tumbls. A blog-post from [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) is neatly placed. [Twitter](http://twitter.com) posts are inserted as sheer text.

All in all, I like it. It's thought through, helps me to save loads of stuff quickly and is very stream-of-consciousness. I think I'm going to continue using it.

When yr idles grow old... You grow old too.

Can't help wanting Depeche Mode still to be great, despite a very lacklustre new album.

This is from a gig the other day, the first I've seen of them in 2017.

I'm very much anti-nostalgia, but when I last saw them live, it was a treat. So hey:

I still don't think I'll see them live in 2017, but I'll always love them for some of their stuff, most for what I think is their masterpiece: "_[**Violator**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violator_(album))_".

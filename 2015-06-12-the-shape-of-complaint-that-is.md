[Ornette Coleman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornette_Coleman) is dead. [James Last](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Last) is dead. [Christopher Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lee) is dead. [Giorgio Moroder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Moroder) just released a new album.

Humans live longer than ever right now.

There's a Facebook group for the mini-town where I live. A small discussion on which food shop's the best quickly disintegrated into "this is why I _dislike_ shops A, B and C", and some dislikes where directed at one shop because its workers are young.

Because of that?

Because of your opinion in this matter, you've effectively disqualified yourself from any kind of thinking process race, you wench. Forget about racing in spades, you're _bitter_. Think of what that means. Bitterness. Yuck.

Most musicians make their best music when they're young.

Didn't stop Sparks from making [some of their best music in decades recently](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/11/franz-and-sparks-this-town-is-big-enough-for-both-of-us). They're old. And I don't attribute that to their collaboration with Franz Ferdinand, a younger band.

Giorgio Moroder still releases new music and DJs, and he's 75 years old. [Noam Chomsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky)'s 86 years old and is the sharpest tack around.

But still, regardless of age, if you're using the internet or any other forum as a sheer negativity outlet, either change your ways or, please, just go fuck yourself.

Just my two cents of constructive, positive words right there, for free.

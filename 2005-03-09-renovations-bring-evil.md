[![Shit shed!](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-09-shed.gif)](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-03-09)A lot of apartments surrounding ours is having extensive renovations done, simply because it's due. Thankfully, we're spared, but we'll get a load of noise but that's no problem compared with what the victims will be getting.

Here's the thrilling part: those of our neighbours who won't have a working bathroom due to the renovations, will have to go shower and use the toilet in that shed. It's a laugh-fest. Imagine them queuing in the mornings, waiting in the blistering cold. I'm evil. Pictures of said shed, and a dish from Pappa Ray Ray that just went along with the ride, are [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-03-09).

Tech: I've just added the Acropop plug-in, which means certain pictures pop up when you move the mouse over them. A few errors means I can't add all of my friends to the list, but it's a nice plug-in, and available [here](http://www.asymptomatic.net/wp-hacks). The Acropop plug-in wasn't exactly all roses. Whenever it found a trigger-name in an image file link, that image did not show. Beyond that, activating it actually took the Google highlight plug-in with itself into the depths of hell as soon as I searched for "\*K\*" in the comments part, so I'm not reinstalling it until further notice.

On Channel 5, we have a popular show called "[High Chaparall](http://www.kanal5.se/default.aspx?id=2243)". Their mission is to spend an entire day or several, with long-forgotten American stars from the 80's. For instance, they've spent time with Vince Neil, Lorenzo Lamas and Ian Ziering.

On the show from tonight, they visited a set where a gay porn film was being made. As the hosts, two Swedish men, have often been accused (by the near-hysterical ex stars who are the "centre of attention" in the episodes) of being gay, I believe they wanted to act out this episode, but using alter egos.

Two gay porn actors were chosen, then got down and dirty (we're talking oral and anal sex), all blurred, of course, while they were addressing each other using the names of the real hosts, e.g. "Oh Filip, will you take it easy with me?" - "NO!" - "Good!" - and then one guy threw the other down on a bed and fucked him in the ass, while the real hosts sat down, watching. It was all done with humor; it's not as cold as it may appear to be.

Sweden shocked? I think it might actually do good to ram a big cock in somebody's ass in front of homophobes at times.

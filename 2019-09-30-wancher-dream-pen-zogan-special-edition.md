**Edit**: my review of this pen is found [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=23920).

Wancher has recently announced the release of a new fountain pen in their Dream Pen series, this one named _[Zogan](https://www.wancherpen.com/products/dream-pen-zogan-sakura)_.

Limited to only 30 copies, it looks to be a real item. Here's the description from Wancher:

"Zo" (?) means "symbol" and "Gan" (?) means "inlay". Layers of mother of pearls are hand-cut and inlaid into the ebonite pen body with exceptional dedication of skillful artisans. Different beautiful shades of the shells will be seen when looking at the Zogan from different directions. Enjoy the beauty of Zogan to the fullest with Japanese vintage material - Ebonite.

Note that the grip section is available in two different styles, sakura and stripe. I choose sakura.

The preorder will be made available onÂ October 1st, 11 am JST time (September 30th, 10 pm EDT time).

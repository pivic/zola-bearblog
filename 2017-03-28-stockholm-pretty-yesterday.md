Having lived in Stockholm, Sweden, for all of my life, I've learned not to shout about spring being here too early; winter's fickle, and easily strikes back when one's expected it not to.

Regardless, yesterday was really pretty. I had to take my gloves and scarf off and nearly took my jacket off, too, but kept my senses despite how much I wanted to sit by the water with X and just bask in the rays. Can't wait to wear sunglasses again.

I've been ill since late Thursday evening, overcome by food poisoning, but that's just fading away to become (I fucking _hope_, anyway!) a very distant memory _very_ soon.

It's supposed to snow come tomorrow. But I don't care about that.

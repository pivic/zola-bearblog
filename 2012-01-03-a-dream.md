_This dream may feature a personal unconscious fear of getting old and despise of Stone Island clothes, and it does feature a friend, lovely nature and my previously unknown simian features._

I was on the top of a steep hill, which was covered in moss. The air hung heavy with the smell of firs and the sea. Behind me were a bunch of sporty teenage boys who all taunted me for holding a beer; I can remember the phrase "That's what they drink in the poor areas" being followed by taunting laughter.

Patrick was standing with somebody by a lake that started appx. fifty meters in front of and thirty meters below me. I was glad to see him.

I was suddenly acutely aware that the hill on which the teenagers and I were sitting was very steep; in fact, I was abruptly standing up with only one foot on a ledge with no space for the other foot, and my hands clasped for moss to hold on to if I were not to meet Patrick sooner and messier than I had expected.

As the teenagers became aware that the hill was somehow producing a landslide, I became more aware that hey, I could tackle this; I was wearing my old brown leather jacket, and if I'd just leap onto a fir I could easily swing from one to the next.

"Patrick!" I yelled.

"Patrick! The hill's giving way! You've gotta run, man!" I yelled, and he OK'd back to me and ran big gangly steps to the left.

So I jumped from the miniscule ledge, right into a tree. I felt really safe hugging the tree, and the jacket saved me from everything. It made me feel warm and I just knew that wearing it, I would be able to swing from one tree to the next without any problems. So I started hopping from one tree to the next, hugging them intensely before letting go - not because I was afraid of falling but because it just felt good.

The hill gave way which I heard. I looked over my shoulder and realised that I was safe from harm but the teenagers weren't; they started piling up, backing up as the hill was lurching forward towards the water, faster and faster. All the teenagers were wearing Stone Island clothes, and even though some of them knew they were dying, they accepted it and as the first of them fell under the hill, they did so with the complacency of lazy, non-athletic teenagers.

The tree felt good. I wanted to start swinging onwards but I then woke up.

Listening to David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti's versions of the original Twin Peaks theme is great, it's fun to hear alternative versions. They're available on "**_[The Twin Peaks Archive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Twin_Peaks#The_Twin_Peaks_Archive)_**", a massive collection of music as created by Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch. Enjoy!

As if I haven't pushed this onto every living soul I know, I saw [Bonde Do Role](http://myspace.com/bondedorole) live at Debaser Slussen last Thursday. I then wrote the following, culled from my own writing off [my own last.fm-journal](http://www.last.fm/user/pivic/journal/2007/05/18/426864) on the matter:

> They just killed Stockholm by playing at Debaser Slussen, where the Swedish guys weren't exactly prepared for Marina (the female MC) to grab their paws and stick them on her - they shyed away in terror, ha! Hopefully this'll have waken their libido up. Anyway, the gig was extremely good. From listening to "With Lasers" I got the feeling they'd rock live, and they did. Hard.
> 
> From jumping up and down at their 80's metal samples to their snatched beats culled from Daft Punk's "Oh Yeah" to the melody-track from Salt and Pepa's "Push It", people screamed along as Pedro (the male MC) was amphetamined to the brim, and everybody just went wild and screamed along to the new tracks while throwing their hands in the air.
> 
> People were invited on-stage to dance and get assaulted by la MC; the girls invited were told to assault le DJ/MC (Gorky), but were far too gentle to do so.
> 
> "This is our love song", they proclaimed just before hitting a calm track - which means a couple of BPM's below their usual level - and then launching into head-banging and doing the funk/devil's sign at that. Amazing dance, amazing rhythms, great gabber and a lot of love and strength from this grand band.
> 
> I wish them all the well in the world when their coming album, "[With Lasers](http://www.dominorecordco.com/site/index.php?page=releases&releaseID=700)", hits in the start of June. They're on [Domino](http://www.dominorecordco.com/site/index.php?page=artists&artistID=228), who would have thought it?

Why you should adore this band? Check out this live performance courtesy of [Fader Magazine](http://www.thefader.com), where they play "Melo Do Tabaco". They were even more wild in Stockholm. [Everybody loves them](http://tumblr.pivic.com/post/2284312).

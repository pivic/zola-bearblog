Welly-well. Apart from the fact that Steven Moffat, the man who writes "_[Sherlock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_%28TV_series%29)_", is a misogynist ((As carefully, painfully read [here](http://feministwhoniverse.tumblr.com/post/25598314408/steven-moffat-is-a-douchebag-the-masterlist) and [here](http://feministwhoniverse.tumblr.com/post/25598314408/steven-moffat-is-a-douchebag-the-masterlist).)) and Martin Freeman, who plays Watson, seems to [harbour insanity in relation to women](http://www.themarysue.com/martin-freeman-rape-joke), this season took a nose-dive to the worse.

What happened to "Sherlock's" ((I'm putting that in quotation marks as Benedict Cumberbatch's character has slipped so far from the original plot that he's to consider a character based on Sherlock Holmes; and before you cry murder on murder, do note that I really liked seasons one and two.)) mind that one followed throughout the first two seasons? You'll remember, if you're not completely dim-witted by the barrage of not-really-needed special effects, HD camera close-ups and other fireworks throughout the two last episodes from season 3! Sherlock Holmes is all about the mind. Not about scenes where he's shot and takes minutes to fall down, through something that reminds me of listening to prog rock - all play, play, play but no result. Like wanking without a cause, really. When was Sherlock Holmes about much other than the mind? About the plot, the thinking and the feeling of going on an adventure?

This turned out badly. The series, I mean. It's like watching "_[Nip/Tuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nip/Tuck)_", where everything went _horribly_ wrong after a few seasons. You'd think Moffat and the rest would manage, especially as they're basically - no matter how much one loves the script and whatnot - just tracing patterns; the stories have been written, it's just a matter of re-writing stuff and presenting it lovely.

Hell's bells. Why just care about the presentation? It's not about the gift-wrapping, it's about the contents. Sure, I love a good plot twist. But this one? It's like season 3 is person who rings the door, you open, the person sells you something, you invite the person into your room to tell you more, you look forward to it, and then you're suddenly held at gun-point, being forced to swallow a pill and then you're down the rabbit hole - in a bad way. Things happen in the series, but you don't care. As MTV has abandoned music videos, it seems the BBC is using all its power to bring on fast cuts and flashy focus-and-pan effects through multi-coloured lights to make you think that, yes, you do actually care if Moriarty isn't dead.

The series just died. Does anybody care?

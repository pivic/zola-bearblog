Frederic tipped me about [Session Saver]( http://www.extensionsmirror.nl/index.php?showtopic=166) for Firefox. This extension saves everything in your Firefox the way you've left it when you shut it down, so that the next time you start it up - every tab's there. Quoting:

> SessionSaver restores your browser -exactly- as you left it, every startup, every time. Not even a crash will phase it. Windows, tabs, even things you were typing -- they're all saved.

I'm into getting myself a [Nespresso Essenza D90](http://www.nespresso.com/precom/sima/fiche__Nespresso_Essenza_D90__N_ESS_D90_2_se_en.html). Why, when I've got access to a coffee machine at work? Well, "ours" is 1) messy and 2) proffers bad coffee. Sure, we can get good beans for grinding, but that's unlikely to happen. Letting the tax-payers donate their hard-earned bucks for me to have quality espressi? I couldn't live with myself. Anyway, the Nespresso machine (which only differs in colour and shape from [the 300SKR-more expensive C90 model](http://www.nespresso.com/precom/sima/fiche__Nespresso_Essenza_C90__N_ESS_C90_2_se_en.html)) is interesting. It's quite cheap, produces high pressure when making espresso...and it doesn't do anything else. That's the thing. You buy the coffee in little pods, ordering through the Internet, and they're delivered within two days. [Here](http://www.nespresso.com/precom/n_home_se_en.html)'s more info on how it works. I intend to go visit [NK](http://www.nk.se) after work, to try them out.

Mikaela and I visited her parents yesterday. They had cooked extremely tasty foods, spits with chicken, sausage, grilled peppers and other goodies on them, with a simple salad, dressings, and [a very nice cake](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/46534764), so after that I went kitty-photographing. Even though [this picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/46534953) turned out blurred like hell, I like it. [Here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/46535034)'s another vampyric moment, and [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/46535106)'s my favourite. I like adored, squished kittys.

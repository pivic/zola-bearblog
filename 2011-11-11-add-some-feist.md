X's just helped me discover [Feist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_(singer)), and as such I wasn't too pleased when I saw this on Ticnet's first page trying to book tickets:

But I persevered and got my way in the end, yeay! We're going in March. It'll be something to look forward to, for sure. When X and I saw Bon Iver last weekend, we'd booked the tix in May and I almost forgot about them until a week before the gig. Remembering that's like a little present to yourself.

You bet. We're going to see Ice Cube as he [hits Stockholm in July](http://www.aeglive.se/artister/ice-cube.php), for the first time in 15 years. I'm looking forward to extreme amounts of sexism, racism, wiggerism and funkiness.

And the tickets are now literally in my hand, yeeeea boiiiiii bitches!

Justice has compiled [this muxtape](http://thrillistcoachella.muxtape.com) based on [the current Coachella roster](http://www.coachella.com/event/lineup). Brilliant! [SebastiAn](http://www.myspace.com/0sebastian0)'s "_[Momy](http://hypem.com/track/526587)_" rocks my world, as does Boys Noize's remix of Justice's own "_Phantom Pt II_".

Let me rephrase that:

SebastiAn's "Momy" is the best new track I've heard in a _long_ time. You can listen to it [here](http://www.zshare.net/audio/10474540b78460de/), and don't forget to pick up SebastiAn's "[Motor EP](http://www.nuloop.com/en/vinyl-records/electro-techno/detail/66708/sebastian-motor_ep.html)", out now.

[Terence Fixmer](http://myspace.com/terencefixmer) has just released his first 12" - "[Avalance EP](http://www.7digital.com/stores/productDetail.aspx?shop=734&pid=218525)" - in a year, and I've really been looking forward to his new release! I can't say I've heard other tracks than the one available at his MySpace page, but it's promising, even though I like Dave Clarke more. As if that's not enough, [Fixmer/McCarthy](http://fixmermccarthy.com) play Stockholm in May.

Portishead has played Coachella, and somebody's nice enough to have released a radio rip of the event downloadable in its entirety right [here](http://www.deafindieelephants.com/2008/04/27/mp3-exclusive-portishead-coachella-2008/). Now buy [their new album](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Third-Portishead/dp/B0014C2BL4)!

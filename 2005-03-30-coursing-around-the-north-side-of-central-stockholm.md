I've been on a course today, so by clicking [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-03-30) you'll find pictures. It's a course on demands, on being able to write full descriptions on exactly what one desires from a supplier, when it comes to complex orders, e.g. an order of a big system or an upgrade of a system. I'm so tired, will tomorrow try to finish my Sparks podcast. Yikes!

I can't come over the fact that I want a [Sony PSP](http://www.us.playstation.com/psp.aspx). Check out [these pictures](http://wvs.topleftpixel.com/archives//050325_1090.shtml) of it, how cool it looks, and foremost, the quality of the screen. Damn.

Anne's Food reports of these wonderful new-born kittens. Check [the pictures](http://annesfood.blogspot.com/2005/03/welcome-kittens.html) out. You have to.

This may provide an alternate and weird start of the week! It's fun to see that a lot of [**Abruptum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abruptum)'s music has recently been added to streaming sites.

My favourite Abruptum album is definitely "_Obscuritatem Advoco Amplectere Me_". It's got two tracks which are somewhat undiscernable from each other. While I think most people will consider this a jumbled collection of guitar, drums, synths, and weird screaming, this definitely does have its place in the annals of black metal and is overall a great jump away from most predictable pap music of today.

To me, a lot of black metal music easily fall into the same issue as almost all kinds of music: it's quickly derivative. Upon hearing some new band's music it's often easy to spot their influences and they don't invent. Abruptum sound as though they've loved [John Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carpenter) and cheap-ass synths, which works very well in a kind of cheesy horror fashion; this music is not really scary when listening to a snippet of it, but when you've had it running for some time it does creep up on (at least) me, much like a [Dario Argento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dario_Argento) film.

I've no idea why, but this music works better for me as I'm listening to it at the end of the day rather than at the start - mainly because it's probably too..._misanthropic_ in the morning for yours truly.

Thanks to the powers of the Internet, check out the entire "_Obscuritatem Advoco Amplectere Me_" below:

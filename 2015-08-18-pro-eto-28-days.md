I was surprised to see Sandra Bullock sporting the below [Mayakovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Mayakovsky)/[Lilya Brik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilya_Brik) image from the cover of the poem "_Pro Eto_" as a t-shirt in the film "_[28 Days](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191754)_":

I can't help but feel a bit elated when somebody does Mayakovsky a something into the cultural sphere now and again. And don't miss out on [Bengt Jangfeldt's supreme biography in Mayakovsky and the Briks](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/11376512/Mayakovsky-a-Biography-by-Bengt-Jangfeldt.html), which [I, too, gave 5/5](https://niklasblog.com/?p=5432).

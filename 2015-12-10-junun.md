I really dig the new album from these guys. It's a hypnotic experience, enthusiastic and just altogether fucking good.

Off [this Pitchfork article](http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/971-radioheads-jonny-greenwood-and-shye-ben-tzur-talk-junun-project/) on this album:

> **JG**: The strangest part of Indian music is its lack of chords: There's no such thing as major or minor, and it's unusual to hear more than two different pitches at the same time. This means that melodies don't have to be pinned down to chords, so they sound much freer and more fluid than in western music. I was wary of falling into the trap of imposing western chords on everything: so a few songs on Junun have chords, but most don't – it's all about the raag and the rhythms. I thought of the bass and guitar as being droning percussion instruments – droning in the sense that they didn't change note – that could sit in amongst all the Indian drums. It was a little like how I'd imagine playing in James Brown's band – not many chord changes, but some captivating rhythms to kick a bass line off of.

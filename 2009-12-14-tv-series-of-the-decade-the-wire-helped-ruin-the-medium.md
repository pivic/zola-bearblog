From [The Guardian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")'s current series of articles titellled "[The people who ruined the decade](http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2009/dec/12/the-people-who-ruined-the-decade3)", which is just as it reads. Here we go, an extremely quick recap of what I deem to be the best TV-series not only of the decade, but forever.

> At first, The Wire seemed like a cop show. Then it felt like a really good cop show. Then we realised we were watching [David Simon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Simon "David Simon") pulling apart the very fabric of late American capitalism with a forensic, Dickensian masterpiece and pretty much everything we've watched since just seems a bit, well, unambitious.

A friend of mine named Alexander plays in a band called [Sailor & I](http://www.myspace.com/sailorandi), that recently played live at Fritz's Corner. While there, they had some videos recorded that I've now uploaded to YouTube; to see them all, check [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS9bbLT8mc) collection out!

Here's one of the live videos. The band is currently recording their debut album which is planned for release in the fall.

It's been wonderful. Calm, collected and partying. I'll let pics and video show the way; the video is at the end, where X first thinks they (i.e. X, Tobit and herself) lost against Simon and me, but they really won. In the end though, Simon and I forced through triumphant, hah!

Otherwise, X and I have been at home with Lotta, watching the fourth season of "_Wire In The Blood_", a brilliant TV-series. I thought it'd take a turn for the worse as Hermione Norris, the person who played Carol Jordan, left, but not really. It's still a quite well-written series, and I fear for watching the fifth season as it's the last.

"_[America's Next Top Model](http://www.cwtv.com/shows/americas-next-top-model12)_" has kick-started its 12th season (referred to by the producers as "cycle") now, and even though my fave ((Spoiler! A conspiracy theorist who seemed brainy and very promising.)) throughout the elimination process didn't make it, there's [a christian idiot](http://www.cwtv.com/thecw/americas-next-top-model12-london), [one who has to speak about how she's from Kenya all of the time](http://www.cwtv.com/thecw/americas-next-top-model12-sandra) and my current favourite, [Celia](http://www.cwtv.com/thecw/americas-next-top-model12-celia), who seems not to take herself too seriously and still has something good going. Tyra proved herself as a racist with saying something along the lines of "her dark skin means she must be a part of this competition" about the girl from Kenya. Congratulations, Tyra, you're yet another step away from sanity, racist trash.

The week ahead means a lot of work, but no more driving around Stockholm with computers everywhere. Thank Bog. Hopefully, I'll have more time doing what my profession really entails. And I'll be looking further for a new job.

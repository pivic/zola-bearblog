I've not tried a coffee from **[Bow Truss](http://bowtruss.com)** before. This coffee is a month old since roasting. It's a darkish roast, with an immediate metallic taste on the tongue. Also, it's a very condensed taste: it's as if the taste sensations cobbled together to form one specific sensation, which carries a non-tangy, woody aroma, and the taste is not sharp but obtuse, very cocoa (without any hint of sweet).

All in all: could be a good afternoon coffee for a pick-me-up, for for my liking, this does not differentiate itself enough.

Google has now released [Google Earth](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/06/cover-earth.html), which is beta software (yet working very well as far as I've used it, for half an hour) based on the Google acquisition of Keyhole, and enables the user "to integrate satellite imagery with Google search technology in a single product". I think it'll be a smash hit when Google shifts its enterprise to incorporate info on all major cities in the world - which I have no doubt they want to.

I'm using the freeware version of Google Earth, and [there will be a "plus" and a "pro" version](http://earth.google.com/products.html) , costing between 20-400 USD. They, among other specifics allow you to: "Plug in your GPS device to see your trek. Import a spreadsheet of houses on the market. Draw 3D objects and print clear shots of a beach you are travelling to." Sounds good.

[Here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-06-30-googleearth.jpg)'s a picture of my neighbourhood. The thing I immediately saw, was that Google Earth didn't find the street where Mikaela and I live, but others on the same level. The other thing was that the area we live in is blurry, compared to another are just a few hundred meters from us, as seen in [this image](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-06-30-googleearth2.jpg). On the other hand, watching a close-up of Stockholm city is quite impressive, as seen [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-06-30-googleearth3.jpg). The water, main roads, most of the streets and buildings are visible. You can even see crime stats (for USA so far) in [this shape](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-06-30-googleearth4.gif), if you want to. I'm looking forward to it, and at the same time, Google are getting bigger and bigger. Keep the morals in as your corporation expands, darn it!

**edit**: I managed to see my street for a few seconds, but after zooming out and then in again, it's lost! Interesting. I think it may be because the name of our street is too long to be spaced out over the short strip of street the text appeared on when I happened to catch it (which, incidentally, is the wrong piece of land); anyway, this _is_ beta software, and [here](http://desktop.google.com/download/earth/index.html) are the system requirements to be able to run it.

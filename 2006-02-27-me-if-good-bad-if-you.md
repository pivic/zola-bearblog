As I am writing this, at 17:00 this very cold, quite bright day, there are appx. 30000 Swedes on the way to Medborgarplatsen, going to celebrate the fact that a few people who are citizens of this country (Sweden) have together won a gold medal in the olympics? I think it's for playing ice-hockey, but I'm not.

Well, it's for the country, or so I'm told. What's for the country, you say? Pride? A sense that we all together have something in common, because these people have won a tournament?

[Wake up and get fucking real](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-02-27-olympic.jpg "I'm not part of the same country as Expressen.").

If these players would have failed at attaining even a bronze medal, their names wouldn't have been mentioned anywhere, utterly un-hailed and nothing would have been written except for a few diatribes where old journos would have scorned even the players' spawn's future spawn.

But today, “we won“ and “we're the greatest“ adorn the Swedish papers. Why, oh why, don't they proclaim the opposite when “our“ athletes rock like a pile of shit? Imagine it, headlines like “We're the worst!“ or “We've lost! That's bad!“ I'd definitely celebrate that.

Do I hate sports? Not at all, but I just hate the way the papers and people in general seem to love _themselves_ when a few athletes, who are citizens of of the same country as they, win something. These regular people seldom say or write anything when “our beloved athletes“ lose. I love the way nationalists say something like “we're on the way to a gold medal!“ (meaning the athletes) and (the athletes) fail miserably, as there's nothing more exhilerating than saying “Oh, YOU lost miserably. You're bad!“ They give you the most twisted stare, having somehow severed the what-was-sacred-at-least-a-day-ago link betwixt themselves and their heroes of yore.

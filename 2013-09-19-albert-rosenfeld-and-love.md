As I'm busy blazing through **[Twin Peaks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks)** again with Ida and X, I just came to think of Albert Rosenfeld's dust-up with Sheriff Truman during season one.

Transcript from [here](http://twinpeaks.wikia.com/wiki/Albert_Rosenfield):

**Sheriff Truman**: Anything we should be working on? **Albert Rosenfield**: Yeah. You might practice walking without dragging your knuckles on the floor. Heh heh heh. **Sheriff Truman**: Albert! Let's talk about knuckles. The last time I knocked you down, I felt bad about it, the next time's gonna be a real pleasure. **Albert Rosenfield**: You listen to me. While I will admit to a certain cynicism, the fact is that I am a naysayer and hatchet-man in the fight against violence. I pride myself in taking a punch and I'll gladly take another because I choose to live my life in the company of Gandhi and King. My concerns are global. I reject absolutely: revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method... is love. I love you, Sheriff Truman. **Dale Cooper**: Albert's path is a strange and difficult one.

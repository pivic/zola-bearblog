[![Rape and drinking](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/Bt7u7mMIIAANjkR.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/Bt7u7mMIIAANjkR.jpg) The above, brilliantly augmented image, is courtesy of [neverjessie](https://twitter.com/neverjessie), from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/neverjessie/status/495095743989153794).

I just read the below tweet ((Courtesy of [The Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk), a horrid magazine.)) and basically exploded; not as much from seeing it, but from yet again realising that it happens over and over again, and it needs to stop. We men need to stop it, mainly as we are the perpetrators in _almost every single case_ where sexual violence is concerned.

There's [a lot](http://www.thisisnotaninvitationtorapeme.co.uk/drinking/#.U_8sdCySx2k) to read about these things, and in the UK, [there are resources](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/an-overview-of-sexual-offending-in-england-and-wales); from the latter link:

> Around 90 per cent of victims of the most serious sexual offences in the previous year knew the perpetrator, compared with less than half for other sexual offences.

[This article](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/28/culture-rape-victim-blame-too-far) from The Guardian, written by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, is also very clear-headed. From the article:

> \[...\] it seems not a day goes by when a publicly expressed opinion on rape is met with cries of victim-blaming. This week’s target for censure was Judge Mary Jane Mowat, who chose the occasion of her retirement to express her thoughts on how the rape conviction rate will only improve when women “stop getting drunk”. In a country where most rape victims are raped when sober and by someone they know, surely such a statement encapsulates the very nature of victim-blaming?

There's a lot of statistics surrounding rape, but get the gist, fellows: nobody should ever be raped. If you're naked in the street, passed-out, wearing a shirt saying "FUCK ME", that still means you NEVER, EVER should be sexually harassed in any way. Rape is getting subjected to something you do not wish to happen. As [this page](http://shs.wustl.edu/SexualViolence/Pages/Rape-myths-and-facts.aspx) states:

> _Alcohol is not a cause of rape_; it is only one of many tools that perpetrators use.

And then anti-feministic shit like the below remains:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="sv"><p>Trolls drive video-game critic Anita Sarkeesian out of her house to prove misogyny doesn't exist. <a href="http://t.co/nFzDhorbvr">http://t.co/nFzDhorbvr</a></p>— emilynussbaum (@emilynussbaum) <a href="https://twitter.com/emilynussbaum/statuses/504779515403304960">27 augusti 2014</a></blockquote>

Fight. The. Fucking. Patriarchy. Use facts. Stand up against anti-feministic prejudice that's strewn about like truths, always by men. I'm so fucking tired of that.

Once again, as Zack De La Rocha said: "Your anger is a gift".

As Mikaela and I have sensibly decided, we are going to share responsibilities more, when it comes to kitchen work. As one of us will cook dinner, the other will do the dishes. I've made dinner for tonight (a frittata) and I will be making dinner tomorrow night as well. It's fun! More fun than I thought at first. I'm not much for cooking, but this time around, it was actually fun! I wish I'd remembered to photograph the ordeal, as it turned out OK. The food could have tasted better, or rather - more, if I'd known more of the outcome. To my defense I'll say I have never cooked the thing in my whole life, and I did not ask of any help from Mikaela. I wouldn't let her see the finished product until it was served and standing on the table. It all consisted of eight eggs, zucchini, garlic, yellow onion, feta cheese, paprika, salt, water and pepper. Maybe something more, but I added rocket and filets of chicken.

Before making the dinner, I went to the dentist for the first time in nine years. Not because I had to, but because I didn't want to delay my visit for too long. I fared worse than Tiger Woods - not a single hole in one. Ha! No holes! I was extatic. Well, the dentist (or rather: dental hygienist) applied a prophylactic agent on my teeth, removing stains caused by red wine, coffee and tea. All in all: 774SKR (~56GBP or ~100USD). Yeah, it was worth it.

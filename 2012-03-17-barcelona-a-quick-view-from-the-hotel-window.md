[![The view from the hotel window](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2012-03-17-hotelview.jpg "2012-03-17-hotelview")](https://niklasblog.com/?attachment_id=10277)

This is the view from our hotel window.

The Mediterranean Sea is a stone's throw away from the hotel, which is perfectly situated away from the city center.

Today: the Gothics. And more tapas, please. Can't that piece of culinary culture just completely migrate to Sweden and take over?

[![Hatet: En bok om antifeminism](http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1361701797m/17411508.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17411508)[Hatet: En bok om antifeminism](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17411508) by [Maria Sveland](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1311830)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/556270869)  
  
This book was very, very refreshing to read. And by this I mean that Sveland carries a voice that cuts through a lot of nonsense. She starts with identifying antifeminism, what it has been like in Sweden (and to some extent internationally, but mainly in Sweden) and goes on to describe how Sweden is still not gender-equal, how antifeminism has grown beyond critique into pure hatred, and what this hatred consists of.

The book is modern. It's a piercing view into the callow, uncouth world made out by - mainly - anonymous men who try and fight feminism even though they lack the most basic insight into what feminism really is, not to mention self critique.

In my view, I would have liked more statistics in the book, and far less personal reflections in the mini-chapters that Sveland has divided into the name of months; I feel they got worse as the book progressed, but still, they're such a little part of the book as a whole that they're no real disturbance to any reader, I daresay.

Still, this is recommendable to all who want to learn about antifeminism in Sweden today.

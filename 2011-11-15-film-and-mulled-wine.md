[![Girl, Interrupted](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2011-11-15_104412.png "Girl, Interrupted by puppet")](https://niklasblog.com/?attachment_id=8815)

X and I had some mulled wine yesterday, watched "**[Girl, Interrupted](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172493)**" and had a nice, quiet evening. Perhaps the first one in a while to come!

We indulged in some [Ripa Starkvinsglögg](http://www.systembolaget.se/Sok-dryck/Dryck/?varuNr=96009) which was spiked with chili and jalapeà±os, but I didn't notice it that much. Mid-way I remembered it but didn't think much about it. Mulled wine's a Swedish traditional thing during winter, which could be mistaken for what it is a great excuse to get sloshed midday; it's like old ladies in retirement, sipping liqueurs behind older curtains while dust layers.

The film was better than I'd hoped for. I mean, usually when you bunch Hollywood stars together I find that's all there is, there's seldom anything more unless you have a visionary like, say, Terry Gilliam. This time I think James Mangold - the director, who also made "**[Walk The Line](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358273)**" - directed very well. The characters came to life and weirdly enough Angelina Jolie's performance reminded me of Brad Pitt's from "**[Twelve Monkeys](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746)**". According to iMDb, Jolie distanced herself from Winona Ryder ((Who plays the main character in the film.)) completely during non-filming in order to become as detached from her as possible, in order to play the villain, so to speak.

Even though the film used stereotypical inmates - it's about a girl who ends up in an "insane asylum" - it was entertaining. In retrospect it made me think about the things I used to concern myself with during the teens. Who hasn't examined the underbelly of a faucet for an hour or so while bawling your eyes out or just waited for the world to end while listening to ultra-sad music?

The film was a good one. Speaking of film I'm looking forward to seeing "**[Hunger](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0986233)**", a film by Steve McQueen who's made "**[Shame](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1723811)**", a film that's just now being released. Both look strong. Reminds me also of Lynn Ramsay who's both made "**[Ratcatcher](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171685)**", "**[Morvern Callar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300214)**" and "**[We Need To Talk About Kevin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242460)**", all films I want to see.

Any recommendations for a funny film would be greatly appreciated. Last time I saw "**[Clueless](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112697)**" which is still a dated-yet-semi-timeless classic.

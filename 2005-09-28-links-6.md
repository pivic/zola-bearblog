According to [this post](http://portableaudio.engadget.com/entry/1234000100060785) off Engadget, Apple seem to live in denial on how many people are affected by the sensitive screen of their latest audio-player, the [iPod Nano](http://www.apple.com/ipodnano), but just check the comments on [this Nano thread](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000970060464) on Engadget to get that lots of people - even though not all may have contacted Apple about their problems - seem affected.

Mr. Skin has posted [this funny interview with Peter Bagge](http://www.mrskin.com/Skinterviews/96/Peter_Bagge.htm), the guy who's been churning out acclaimed comic "[Hate](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=niklasblog-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/1560976233)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)" for a long time.

I just found [Rock 'n' Roll Confidential](http://www.rockandrollconfidential.com/hall/index.php?page=1), one of the few places on the web where picture-texts match the pictures themselves on a humoresque scale. [This one](http://www.rockandrollconfidential.com/hall/hall_detail.php?dd_keyid=17) is my favourite right now.

RSA has now released [this info](http://www.rsasecurity.com/press_release.asp?doc_id=6095) on how multiple passwords frustrate users and endanger security:

> The results of the RSA Security survey reveal that employees are managing an incredibly large number of passwords at work. Twenty-eight percent of respondents must keep track of more than 13 passwords; 30 percent of respondents manage between 6-12 passwords. Managing so many passwords is leading to greater end user frustration: the vast majority of those surveyed (88 percent) reported frustration with the password management process.

Interesting. Also: "Respondents were queried on the impact of leveraging a 'master password,' which could be used to gain access to all other passwords." Very interesting. I think all of this just points to how ordinary the [single sign-on](http://www.answers.com/single%20sign-on) technology might become.

Oh, and I'm looking forward to the new album from Nelly McKay. Haven't you heard her? Check her out, I say. Her lyrics are great. From [her site](http://www.nelliemckay.com):

> PRETTY LITTLE HEAD featuring duets with Cyndi Lauper and k.d. lang will be in stores Tuesday, October 18.
> 
> Featuring a kaleidoscopic selection of tracks culled from 23 new songs written by McKay for the album, Pretty Little Head premieres duets with Cyndi Lauper ("Beecharmer") and k.d. lang ("We Had It Right") as well as an assortment of provocative new compositions including "Columbia Is Bleeding" ("...it's turned into a real rock tune..."), "Cupcake" ("...about gay marriage..."), and "The Big One" ("...about a tenant's rights activist...").

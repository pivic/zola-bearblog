I've just started re-listening to LL Cool J's "[Mama Said Knock You Out](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDSUB040312261145551591&sql=A8kd2vwxva9xk)", and it's still good. OK, it's dated, but [Marley Marl](http://www.hiphopmusic.com/photo/marley.html)'s beats still make my hairs stand on end, and I must add I remember the video for "[Mama Said Knock You Out](http://universalurban.com/site/media/llcoolj/video/mammasaidknockyouout/llcooljmammasaid_vidhi.ram)" as fierce.

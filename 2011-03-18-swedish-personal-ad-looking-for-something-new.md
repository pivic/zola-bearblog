Personal ads can be hilarious, but this one from my local paper takes the cake:

![JordnÃ¤ra](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5217/5536728156_840306d7e4.jpg)

Translates as such to English:

> I'm a 51-year-old guy. Inter. gym, driving four-wheel-drive MC and archipelagian life. Looking for a woman between 40 and 54 years, who is done with life, wants to go for something new and is earthbound.

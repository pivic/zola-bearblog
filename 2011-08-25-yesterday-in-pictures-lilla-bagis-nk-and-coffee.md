[The only café in Bagarmossen](http://lillabagis.se) - so far, because there's a second one in the works! - needs somebody to work for them. I hope all fares well for them.

After work, I went to NK to get new heels for X's beautiful new shoes. The place was obviously in a weird state of renovation.

I checked the shoes in with Mister Minit @ NK, bought some delicious blueberry tea, some Japanese lime tea and sat down at a café with a bizarre ceiling.

Awaiting the shoes to be finished, I had this...

...wrote miles in my diary and read a very interesting book, titelled "[Bakom stängda dörrar](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6714935-bakom-st-ngda-d-rrar)", which deals with abuse; the content is horrible and very hard to stop reading.

Then met up with my lovely wife who liked the job that Mister Minit had done, and we then went home to chill. And after a while of fighting and running, Blixa did, too.

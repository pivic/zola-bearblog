Finally back at **[Popaganda](http://www.popaganda.se/)**! Yes, Stockholm's finest music festival. This year back at Eriksdalsbadet, packed with people and complaints of long queues to the bars and a very non-gender-neutral filming of The xx ((The photographer who filmed the band while performing only showed Jamie during the first half-hour of the gig.)).

Pool partying.

Sold out!

**[Kate Nash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Nash)** was, without a doubt, the most entertaining singer/dancer/person-not-counting-her-music. She told tales (girl band! cocaine!) and wore a dress made mainly of balls. Her band was tight. While playing they reminded me of Nirvana. Oh, bliss. The songs were good! I've gotta listen to her more. Here's some shamefully bad vid by yours truly:

[**El Perro Del Mar**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Perro_del_Mar). What a career move! When I last heard her music, it was quiet, sombre, using a guitar. Now, there's beats, even modern reggae, some The Knife-sounding shit. Very good! The sax-player on stage looked like Kristoffer Triumf.

Yes, this is [**The xx**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_xx). Blinding. The band had a great stage show, and the camera displayed them from the front; even though the camera-handler should be kicked in the ass for only filming Jamie for the first half of the show, that person almost only shot Romy during the second half. Still, the show was really, really good and the band showed their strength - I'm an xx acolyte, so I shan't say more about it, but it was without a doubt the best gig yesterday, for me.

Today it's back to Popaganda again. Looking forward a lot to Håkan Hellström and Makthaverskan!

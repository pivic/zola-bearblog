On the way from work, listening to music while waiting for the subway to come. Early day off, so not many people waiting, just a couple of people and a family of which two were kids.

I stood a bit away from the family, when the kids started running up and down the platform. They both ran close to me, right in front of me, actually, trying to get some kind of response. I dig that. I met their eyes and smiled. I like kids who want to provoke. However, there have to be fucking limits at times.

One of them started touching me as he passed. The first time I thought it was by accident, but the second time I said "cut it out"; he didn't. The bigger persons who were supposedly his minders made a kind of oops face at me and shrugged.

The kid continued to run right in front of me, touching me once per lap. No death threats from me, not even a little snarl. I didn't touch him back, either.

Then it suddenly occurred to me.

I started walking towards the edge of the platform, to where it ended and train tracks lay cold and shiny a few metres down.

The kid ran, and ran and ran, touching away. Still in front of me.

A couple of steps more and the kid's a goner. Not that I'd make it so. The kid actually seemed stupid enough to be able to trip himself to an early grave.

Suddenly, one of the persons in dire need of a minder - I believe it was one of the parents - yelled "Hey! Don't be stupid! You'll hurt _yourself_!"

That emphasis on "yourself" is courtesy of the shouter.

The kid didn't fucking care about that person either, which ignited some of my respect for it.

The shouter noticed that its words had no effect, jumped up, careened like an idiot spear, shot me a dirty look, grabbed and pulled the kid away and consequently prevented another Darwin award from being issued.

I really don't care about the kid. Kids are prone to diss and piss authorities off. So called grownups, however, who obviously are idiots, I have very little love for. I could be angry at them, but they're already cursed for being themselves.

And the kid? All of us have fucked-up parents, but if I'd had parents like those I'd say the kid's the most cursed of us all.

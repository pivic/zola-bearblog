I can never remember the difference between < and >, i.e. which one means "bigger" and "smaller", respectively.

Now, this may help:

> The "less than" sign and the "greater than" sign look like a "V" on its side, don't they?
> 
> To remember which way around the "< " and ">" signs go, just remember:
> 
> BIG > small small < BIG The "small" end always points to the smaller number

The above is culled from [here](http://www.mathsisfun.com/equal-less-greater.html).

At work, some persons were eating ice cream while discussing discussions (...) that they've seen on the web. One person, confidently, in offhand manner, stated that "political discussions don't belong on Facebook".

This person, a few breaths later, also uttered his belief that "asylum-seekers should not complain as much as they do". As I asked which these complaints actually were, mutterings were heard. Nothing more of it. More ice cream was eaten. Maybe the workplace is a better arena than Facebook, for flaunting xenophobic fare.

That reminds me of the Wolf in the film version of "_The Neverending Story_". It leaped out, fangs and growl, but ended up retreating, with nothing to gain from its attack.

But was it really an attack? Or a try at forming intelligent speak, even?

I'm actually referring to my co-worker, not the wolf. ((Apropos nothing, I must add that I think it's fucking weird that the saying goes "raised by wolves" when wolves are better parents than humans. I mean, have you ever seen a bad wolf parent?)) Also, since when is something not political, in _some_ sense? And when do people really shun discussions, I mean, _really_?

I mean, to verbally splatter stuffs as stupidly as the aforementioned person did, either states that's a) a human being who's made a dreadful mistake, which means that person should take it back, or b) that the person is experiencing cognitive issues so deep that zombies would take offense when playing Scrabble against it.

Now. I love stupidity in a lot of shapes, like Ramones' _genius_ ways of dousing their style in it, or Stephen Colbert's fake punditry, the kind of court jester type of stuff. On the other hand, if you're male, white, point at a group of people who already suffer beyond what you even comprehend...well, let's just say I won't hold the thimble that is more than adequate to collect the depths of your Male Tears. If you say all that, which you _actually_, doubtfully did, if you're truly that shallow and don't reflect on what you've said afterward, you've got it made ((That is, if you consider your Apotheosis confirmed by wearing stupidity as your crowning glory.)) in the shade. Too bad those sunglasses probably consist of an opaque material.

On the other hand, if there's an inkling in your soul that seems to indicate that you've said something in error, if you look in the mirror without anybody else nearby, you do a bit of conscious soul-searching and you find that your empathy levels match those of Donald Trump, you should get out more. No, not like Damon Albarn shouted in "_Parklife_", more like, get out _into the world_, meet people, be open to how other people experience life, because that may differ from your experiences; it may even be something you'd prefer to how you live life today, so have an open mind. Don't be afraid of the Dark. That only enables the Wolf. Hang out with asylum-seekers and know they are just like you in most ways. Be critical, mainly of your own thoughts, to see through what you're prone to accept without questions arising, and you'll blossom. Promise. See some relevant documentaries at the very least. All people are equal. Don't be bad. Sometimes I think children should be our leaders, only for their straight-forwardness and honesty.

This is not some patchouli-sniffin' thing, sitting in a ring, singing Kumbaya. Even if it were, hell, would it be wrong? Don't be bad. It needn't be harder than that. Don't make another person cry, is that OK for all of us?

The Wolf missed its quarry due to bad timing and the imminent danger of rocks smashing its head, if I remember correctly, so what could the rocks be represented by in the real-world scene I've described? [Riposte](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/riposte)? Could be. What would the cave be, the one that the Wolf retreated back to to? Somewhere other than Facebook? Hate-monging sites for xenophobes? Drowning in other distractions? Anonymity? Learning about the suffering and hardships endured by people who flee from persecution and death? I'll keep hoping for the last choice while I loop Michael Jackson's "Heal The World" in my head.

Isn't it strange that some persons who live a very sheltered life, for examples, without the threat of war, getting killed as the result of a wanton bureaucratic decision, carry no qualms whatsoever about judging others, mainly people who they've never met or even communicated with, on the basis that they "complain too much"?

Xenophobia rears its head. To even infer the possibility of intellectual design somewhere in that muck is just a hellacious howl to anyone who's not a half-wit. I mean, you probably won't let somebody who hasn't attended medical school and is licensed to perform surgery on you, so don't accept "home truths" that are actually utterly moronic, without some critical thinking. Please.

I think I'll go and listen to Bill Hicks' great monologue about [life as "just a ride"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzQuE1pR1w) a few times now and get filled-up by knowing there's hope, as there will always be a lot of sane, lovely people living amidst us.

I love quick clips that have with music to do, as it's MTV as MTV used to be. Reminds me of the collage that the kid in the film "_[Down And Out In Beverly Hills](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090966/)_" did. Anyway, this interview is a great example of what I think is amateur winning over professional, as it's passionately made. Kudos! 2 Many DJs in Korea.

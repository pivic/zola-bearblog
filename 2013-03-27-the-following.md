_True, but possibly in an unintended way._

I started watching the TV series called "[_**The Following**_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Following)" with good intentions. The story involves a God-like serial killer who escapes from jail, Kevin Bacon as The serial killer hunter, and everything is written/edited/controlled by [the person who wrote the "Scream" franchise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Williamson_(screenwriter)), the "I Know What You Did Last..." films, etc.

Sadly, it's all "Scream" mashed with "The Silence Of The Lambs"; while the serial killer man is the only person with a British English accent, the serial killer hunter lacks charisma and is boring. The serial killer displays loads of faces like the lower-the-chin-while smiling in a grim and mocking manner and chilling-and-cold-face-while-quietly-quoting-Edgar-Allan-Poe. Very "[Hello, Clarice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQKs169Sl0I)." But there's more. He listens to classical music. _There are sounds of thunderbolts as the serial killer stands up from a chair._

What about the FBI? Why do they seem to invite anybody to the investigation? And there seems to be very little pressure on their investigating group despite loads of people getting killed all of the time. Must be relaxing to join their band. No biggies.

And so, the serial killer Followers. The serial killer is not only God, he has a hidden agenda (that he often refers to and never gives up) and a cult army consisting of billions of people. Quite possibly billions. I'm really angry at this get-up, as it means a) the serial killer God can do anything because of his omnipotence, b) he's so intelligent he can control anybody in a matter of seconds to get them on his side and c) anybody could be a cult member. Hence, it must be easy peasy to be Kevin Williamson, the guy who's created the show. "Oh shoot, the action's slow in this episode. How should I revive it? I know! I'll get some of the FBIs to become followers! That'll do it. And some more shots of the serial killer in his lair, sitting in a swivel chair with a persian cat in his lap, while sipping whisky, referring to his wife in ways that are sure to make the audience know he's certifiably, wildly insane."

There's some good music in here, notably from Fever Ray and a cut-to-pieces track by Refused, but there are a lot of bad covers, e.g. one Mazzy Star track.

Still, I've watched a bunch of episodes so far. Because it's slow. You know what you get, and at times, it's a little exciting. And I want to see some changes! The idea of change actually entices me. Here's hoping for the best.

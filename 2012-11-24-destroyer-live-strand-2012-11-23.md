The show was very good. The last time I saw [Destroyer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer_(band)) was at Way Out West 2011, where the crowd felt too big. This time it was a lot smaller, and I really wonder how many of the participants had actually heard Destroyer before the gig; I actually think not having heard Destroyer before and attending the gig, really getting into the music and listening to the lyrics would have blown my mind. I remember the first time I heard Destroyer, when X tipped me off. I think it the song was "_European Oils_":

> I made a tomb for all the incompatible cells I could take. I brought bells to the wake. And you, you didn't mind shedding your beautiful European blood as I screamed - "Death to the murderers we've loved all our lives!"

That was mind-blowing.

The band really came together yet felt like a bunch of individuals. The trumpet-player had a whole slew of effect boxes that he continually tweaked, adding a wah-wah and some more effects; he even did a trumpet + effect solo which reminded me of Holy Fuck, Kraftwerk, Neu! and just freaking fucking fun electronic and experimental stuff! That shit was tight and I freaked out to it! Fucking hell, bring more of that shit our way, _please_.

All in all the show was very good ((Despite some idiots of the audience asking "What's the name of that song?" and dancing as if they'd mistaken Destroyer for Swedish House Mafia - when they weren't busy standing at the very front, _texting_.)) and I both loved that so many songs from "Kaput" was played as well as old ones, actually "_Destroyer's Rubies_" kicked ass. I love how Dan uses curse words in lyrics. Why shouldn't he? Fuck that. He blends a seldom heard kind of phrasing in his songs, and that, coupled with interesting and often great, catchy melodies, flowy synth sounds and energetic rhythm guitar and the lyrics, it's punk mixed with balearics and I can't wait to hear his/their next album.

Bought three CDs and a tee. Buying shit at gigs should be obligatory.

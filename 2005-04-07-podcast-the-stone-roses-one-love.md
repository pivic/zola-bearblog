![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-07-onelove.jpg)This is a podcast entirely dedicated to The Stone Roses' "One Love", which is a special song to me.

Most people familiar with The Stone Roses probably remember "Fools Gold", a single that turned the charts upside-down with its purple-tinted video, the lads strapped with Madchester gear and a track that almost everybody loves.

"One Love" is smeared with a wall of distorted wah-wah-guitars, sounds played backwards, vocals that stop half-way into the song (if you're listening to the full, original version which is the one included in this podcast), great bass-lines, a singer who carries his trademark air of lithe arrogance wonderfully, the funkiest drummer of the 80's and a guitarist whose milestone riffs still influence most rockers whether they're aware of it or not. This is truly a great song, and one of my favourite Roses songs.

Even though [the lyrics](http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/One-Love-lyrics-Stone-Roses/1D604ACDA4E918B3482569EC002EE087) are a bit dodgy at places, the love is there. Example:

> I'm no dog or a dolphin I just don't live in the sea You feel my flow and you flood my brain Show me a vision you wild apparition And sink to the depths of your soul
> 
> One love, we don't need another love One love, one heart and one soul We can have it all Easy, easy do do do do do

To listen to what I've to say about it and to listen to the song itself, [here it is](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-07-onelove.mp3).

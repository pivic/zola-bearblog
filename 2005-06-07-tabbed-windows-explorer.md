I've just been tipped about a little program called [ExplorerXP](http://www.explorerxp.com), which is a substitute for Windows Explorer, the built-in file browser (if you're using MS Windows).

It's freeware, very small (370KB, v. 1.06), supports [tabbed folder browsing](http://www.explorerxp.com/screens/tabs.gif), which I really like, and displays how much memory every folder eats. Very nifty!

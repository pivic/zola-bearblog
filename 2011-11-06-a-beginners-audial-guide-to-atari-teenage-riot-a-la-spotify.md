[![Atari Teenage Riot](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/Screen-Shot-2011-11-06-at-10.45.40-AM.png)](http://open.spotify.com/user/pivic/playlist/7ansrrHVA52WBwdKy5ZPeI)A bunch of years ago I wrote [this post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=580) where I published a podcast on Atari Teenage Riot. That track is still up and available despite my horrendous voce, but here's an update: my Spotify playlist on the band.

Since the prior post the band's reunited, are currently touring, have released a new album, changed their line-up some and are more paranoid than ever - in a good sense.

Trying to find slow tracks that won't instantly scare off somebody who wants to try to get into this band is like trying to find dark spots on the face of the sun, but...it's the nature of the beast. I've tried to diversify the band a little but still stay true to their nature as a whole.

If you're into politics, beats and anger turned into adrenaline turned into music turned into revolutionary will, this band is for you. Of course, Spotify lacks a lot of their odd tracks and not-so-odd, like the studio version of the collaboration they did with Slayer, called "_No Remorse (I Wanna Die)_", found below in a YouTube video.

[Here](http://open.spotify.com/user/pivic/playlist/7ansrrHVA52WBwdKy5ZPeI)'s the playlist as found on Spotify and below's the tracklist:

**01 - Deathstar ((From "Burn, Berlin Burn".)) 02 - Speed ((From "Delete Yourself!".)) 03 - Digital Decay ((From "Is This Hyperreal?".)) 04 - Hetzjagd Auf Nazis-(Live In Berlin) ((From "1995".)) 05 - Destroy 2000 Years Of Culture ((From "Burn, Berlin Burn".)) 06 - Activate! (feat. CX Kidtronik) ((From "Is This Hyperreal?".)) 07 - Is This Hyperreal? ((From "Is This Hyperreal?".)) 08 - Kids Are United ((From "Kids Are United".)) 09 - Strike ((From "Kids Are United".)) 10 - Sick To Death ((From "Delete Yourself!".)) 11 - No Remorse - Live In New York ((From "Redefine The Enemy".))**

[This](http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/jon_stewart_stephen_colbert_americas_anchors) Rolling Stone Magazine interview with Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert says more than the basic facts surrounding the American invasions of Iraq, coupled with the [death that Saddam Hussein has been sentenced to](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6117910.stm).

These men lead American opinions by the hand using humor as their weapon of choice, concentrating on what I percieve is the correct way to battle ignorance and governmental corruption in a plethora of ways. From the interview:

> **Do you think the country would be better off if the Republicans or the Democrats were running it?**
> 
> STEWART: I have no idea.
> 
> COLBERT: I wouldn't mind finding out what the options are.
> 
> STEWART: Yeah. It's sad that there are only those two choices. I think we'd be better off if you had a sense that people were making decisions based less on their future political considerations and more on what they believed were in the best interests of the country and the world.
> 
> **Do you think anybody does that on the political scene?**
> 
> STEWART: If they are, they're disguising it pretty well...

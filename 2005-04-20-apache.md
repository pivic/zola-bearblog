Soul Sides has just put [this good article](http://soul-sides.com/2005/04/all-roads-lead-to-apache.html) on display, which shows how the legendary song "Apache" got pushed from being written by Jerry Lordan after getting inspired by a western film, to the forefront of hip-hop.

Sure, it's probably most known from the cover by [The Shadows](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:1s120rnac48j~T1), but it's the one by Michael Viner's Incredible Bongo Band that started the hip-hop explosion. Read up on that at Soul Sides, and get "Bongo Rock", the best compilation by Michael Viner's Incredible Bongo Band.

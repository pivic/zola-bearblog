**[Shea Serrano](https://twitter.com/SheaSerrano)** has written a so-far - as I've only read 62% of it - great book named "_[The Rap Year Book: The Most Important Rap Song From Every Year Since 1979, Discussed, Debated, and Deconstructed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24795949-the-rap-year-book)_", which I recommend to all. Here's a couple of quotes from it in regards to the dead, great **Ol' Dirty Bastard**:

> During the State of the Union address in 1994, President Bill Clinton talked about a lot of things, as presidents tend to do during State of the Union addresses. Here’s a thing he said about government assistance: “We have to end welfare as a way of life and make it a path to independence and dignity.” He said more, but that’s a fine enough summation of his premise.
> 
> During 1995, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, the most erratic and unpredictable member of the group, did a lot of crazy things, as bastards who are old and dirty tend to do. Here’s a thing he said about government assistance: “The people that wanna cut off the welfare, man, I think that’s terrible. You know how hard it is for people to live without nothin’?” He said it during an interview with MTV.
> 
> Everyone thought it was funny because it came after he’d ridden in a limousine with MTV to pick up the food stamps he’d been allotted that month by New York. ODB had of course earned more than enough money to disqualify himself from aid—Enter the Wu-Tang sold more than a million copies, plus he’d been given a $45,000 advance from his record label, Elektra, for his own solo album. But he’d not filed his taxes for the year yet, so the state was using his previous year’s income reporting, so, in that particular moment, he was eligible. “I’m glad to get the food stamps. Why wouldn’t you want to get free money? . . . You owe me forty acres and a mule, anyway.”

That's more politics, truth, fun and craziness than [Spike Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee) would come up with while directing a video for [Wild Man Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Man_Fischer).

The other quote:

> In a separate interview with MTV, John Norris asked ODB if he was a fan of Drew Barrymore. ODB said he didn’t know who she was, though he definitely used the F word in there. Norris told ODB that she was in E.T. ODB said yes, that he remembered, she was the little bald-headed girl who played E.T. **HE THOUGHT E.T. WAS DREW BARRYMORE AS AN ALIEN.** I love you and I miss you, ODB.

I used bold above. It's required. I agree with Shea - I love you and miss you too, ODB. I really miss you.

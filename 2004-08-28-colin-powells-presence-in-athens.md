I'm sure you've heard of [last night's protests in Athens](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3607242.stm), against Colin Powell arriving to the country. Protesters were tear-gassed into oblivion, to ensure the safety of Colin.

It reminds me of the recent news on the British soldier who received 17 million dollars \[I'm unsure of the numbers, but bear with me for the money-shot\] for having been handicapped by the US military, while the [Iraqi wedding entourage who were bombed](http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/9133A091-4BD1-418C-B205-79E0B9B9BD06.htm), where over 40 people were killed \[[which the US government tried to deny](http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1223564,00.html)\], received a _total_ amount of less than 200USD.

One non-Iraqi person, handicapped, yet still living = 17 million USD. Over 40 dead Iraqis + handicapped = 200USD. That's value of life.

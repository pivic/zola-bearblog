I have just discovered [All Consuming](http://www.allconsuming.net), a site that does the following:

> All Consuming is a website that watches weblogs for books that they're talking about, and displays the most popular ones on an hourly basis. You can also use this site to add a list of books to your own weblog (and you don't need to know HTML).

It's very interesting, so from now on, you'll see what I'm reading and/or recommending in the right hand side of my blog.

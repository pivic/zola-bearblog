This is an astounding book. Shane Bauer is the journalist who decided to go undercover while getting hired as Corrections Officer in a penitentiary in the USA. He doesn't only describe all that went down during his time there, but arduously and effectively describes the history that surrounds North American prisons, and how they were turned to the big modern-day version of capitalism slavery that we currently see. This is a big romp to the non-normalised mind I have, where it comes to systematic abuse and enslavement of human beings, especially the poorer kinds.

> I began to read through their prison records and learned that many who had been in the hole for years had not committed violent offenses in prison. Some were indeed dangerous gang members, while others were put in solitary because of people they hung out with, for their work as jailhouse lawyers, or because they possessed books on African American history.

It's not very astounding to see how the modern-day, privately owned prison system works; it's exactly like any efficient operation. The top bosses make the most money (by far) and everybody uses systematic corruption to their own advantage, leaving the actual prisoners at the very bottom.

> On my second day, I wake up at six a.m. in my cottage on Sibley Lake near the edge of Natchitoches, a town of eighteen thousand located about a forty-minute drive from Winnfield, Louisiana. I decided to live here to minimize my chances of running into off-duty guards. As I eat breakfast, I watch a soft drizzle on the water outside my kitchen window. I feel a shaky, electric nervousness as I put a pen that doubles as an audio recorder into my shirt pocket. I pour coffee into a stainless-steel thermos that has a small hidden camera built into its lid. I don’t know what will happen if these items are found, but I think the risk is worth it: I don’t want to rely on the fickleness of memory.

Bauer shines where he tells stories that belong to persons other than himself, and he excels in intertwining those with history in a fascinating way, without sounding too preachy.

This is an excellent way of getting away with some interesting reporting that actually changes stuff. And how he tells of his training:

> He cups his hands around his mouth. “Stop fighting,” he says to some invisible prisoners. “I said stop fighting.” His voice is nonchalant. “Y’all ain’t go’ stop, huh?” He makes like he’s backing out of a door and slams it shut. “Leave your ass in there!” He turns to face us. “Somebody’s go’ win. Somebody’s go’ lose. Hell, they both might lose, but hey, did you do your job? Hell yeah!” The classroom erupts in laughter.

The arguments _for_ private prisons...wait, there are really none. Check these two quotes out:

> Beasley and Crants hit upon the idea of privatized prisons while making small talk at a Republican presidential fund-raiser. An executive from the Magic Stove Company said he thought it would be “a heck of a venture for a young man: to solve the prison problem and make a lot of money at the same time.”

> The main argument in favor of private prisons—that they save taxpayers money—remains controversial. One study estimated that private prisons cost 15 percent less than public ones; another found that public prisons were 14 percent cheaper. After reviewing these competing claims, researchers concluded that the savings “appear minimal.”

The following single quote from an encounter between an apparently somewhat mentally challenged prisoner and a member of a [SORT team](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Response_Team) is very telling:

> I use my political voice! an inmate shouts to the unit manager. I stand up for my rights. Hahaha! Ain’t nowhere like this camp. Shit, y’alls disorganized as fuck up in here. That’s why we are here, a SORT member says. We are going to change all that. Y’all can’t change shit, the prisoner yells back. They ain’t got shit for us here. We ain’t got no jobs. No rec time. We just sit in our cells all day. What you think going to happen when a man got nuttin’ to do? That’s why we throw shit out on the tier. What else are we going to do? You know how we get these officers to respect us? We throw piss on ’em. That’s the only way. Either that or throw them to the floor. Then they respect us.

And violence does propagate from male to male, from male unto female, among the poor, from the rich.

There's a lot to be said about this book, but one of the main things I've so far taken with me is the following:

> Penitentiaries, in Louisiana and elsewhere, were founded on the premise that they would rehabilitate criminals. Were they working? Penitentiary supporters maintained that regimens of silence and forced labor would turn convicts into productive members of society, but there was no evidence to support this. Louisiana policymakers didn’t seem too concerned. By 1857, five years after Hines was released, the penitentiary was making $44,000 in net profit (about $1.2 million, or $4,000 per inmate, in 2018 dollars). When the penitentiary made money like this, did it really matter how the inmates turned out?

I'm eager to finish the book.

![The Devil - not featured in this film.](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-07-12-devil.jpg)Yes, I have now seen "[The Devil Wears Prada](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458352)". The morals of this film: if you're a woman, don't go for a career, go for shit.

If I were Miggs, the guy from "[The Silence Of The Lambs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102926)", I'd most definitely fling cum, shite and wee in the face of the script-writers, the director and every company that sponsored and contributed to the making of this pap. The film-studio shouldn't be allowed to carry on. Jaysis. I'll just quote my own review from Allconsuming:

\*\*\*

I haven't come across anything as backlash-entoned as this since I last saw "Working Girl" and "Fatal Attraction", heard hatred spewed towards women or read Susan Faludi's book "Backlash" - obviously.

Yes, it is subtly done, I give the film-makers that.

In this film, the working woman is The Devil. Please, don't mistake me for some dried-up slag; the main character repels herself, whatever that means, twice over (at least) in this forsaken piece of Meryl-Streep-rules-it-yes-but-it's-still-pap, first, by trying to become something other than a drab, everyday, boring-but-still-human-person, which means becoming an over-worked eentity, a character, albeit an archetype - an archetype for a woman who, if in the guise of a man, would rule the effing world. Second, by forsaking her new, successful self to become _everything her boyfriend wanted her to be_ which is a quote from the film, and is of course double-edged, as he's played by the dude who plays a thoroughly see-through main character in the meta-series "Entourage". How lovely. If you're used to mainstream Hollywood-productions from the past 50 years, this is what you're served.

Of course, there are women who are worse than The Working Woman here, i.e. the woman who's hierarchically above her. What, do you really think The Rich Libertine-ish Male Author breathes anything other than fairy-dust and finds work..._tiresome_? No. He's elite. He probably cries when he doesn't get his want; or doesn't he?

Meryl Streep's character is an Ice Queen. A "dragon", as she refers to (a magazine possibly referring to) herself in her solitary sobbing moment of this film, where she finds herself inept to be perfect - because she cannot hold onto a man. Oh, glorious film! as subtle as a sledge-hammer art thou, glistening against the utter phallic symbol in any common advertisment, oh, film!

It's too bad a flick like this, obviously sponsored by Apple, builds a good feel in the start - mostly due to Streep's and Tucci's acting-abilities, not to mention their acting - couldn't achieve the sense of style.

To quote K.T. Tunstall's "Suddenly I See", one of the first tracks off the soundtrack from this film:

"She got the power to be The power to give The power to see Suddenly I see"

Yes, I see: this is crap. Let me sum the lesson this film teaches us: if you're female, don't have big ambitions, unless those go towards serving your man. And by the way, if you're male and homosexual, you lose, too.

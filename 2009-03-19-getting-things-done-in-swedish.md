My mate [Peter](http://twitter.com/plindberg)'s written a terrific introductory book on [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting%20Things%20Done), which is an acronym for "getting things done". That's a work-life management system as developed by David Allen. The book is in Swedish, available for online viewing below, but also [here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/13401569/Getting-Things-Done-Hur-man-uppnr-stressfri-produktivitet) in as big a format as you like, and offered as a PDF download. Beat that!

I really like GTD, which offers a way to work productively and efficiently when you work with several things at once and is especially useful if you often find yourself in the need to re-evaluate priorities and still be in control of what you do. It isn't written to work for everybody, but I find it indispensible, even though I'm not a [black-belt GTD'er](http://www.marktaw.com/gtd/ReadyForYourBeltTest.html).

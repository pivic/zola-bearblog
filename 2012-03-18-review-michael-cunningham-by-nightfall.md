[![By Nightfall](http://www.decitre.fr/gi/77/9780007307777FS.gif)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12333644) [By Nightfall](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12333644) by [Michael Cunningham](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1432)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/296339858)  
  
The thoughts and, hence, life of Peter Harris, art-dealer in a 20-yearish marriage which drags on. His wife's strange and formerly drug-addicted brother, Mizzy - short for The Mistake - comes to live with them for a while in order to find out what he wants from life.

That's the base. What follows is an inert portrait of a man's thoughts and feelings as sifted through a 40-year-old male living in New York City, affluent working for the often wealthy.

I loved how Cunningham has made the book very easy to read and at the same times makes it feel effortlessly written, how he evokes many thoughts in me by using just a few words at describing something, how he makes the characters in the book believable and...while I think Jeffrey Eugenides' "The Marriage Plot" was a failure as far as endless research goes, this is interesting and captivating, if only for the writing about art, which is _good_.

All in all, I shan't write a good book down by writing for too long about it. This is a very good book. Peter Harris' thoughts will make excellent for re-reads and this could be seen as an excellent partner to Jonathan Franzen's "Freedom", as two of the most evocative modern tales of life I've read in a long while.

It's the end of January, so I thought a little playlist—of only two hours, 44 minutes—is in order! Below are playlists for [Tidal](http://tidal.com/playlist/0aacc223-db67-4905-9dd1-784f2f6a833d), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/pivic/playlist/0Ra03uK4tpdBfBjKfkVwDO), and Deezer. Below there's a little info.

**[Andreas Ammer/FM Einheit](https://www.allmusic.com/album/radio-inferno-mw0000258203)**: one of the best concept albums, ever. Blixa Bargeld screams a bit, John Peel is your DJ en route to Hell, and, well, it's a good fucking intro.

**[TVAM](https://tvamindustries.com)**: I'd not heard this lot until Geoff Barrow shouted their name via an Instagram story. Social media does amount to something at times. This is good shit. Like Neu and guitar riffs, unlike that of Neu though. Fucking hell.

**[Patty Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Griffin)**: I've no idea from where I found her song, but her voice to that piano is beautiful. It's the antidote to [the loudness war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war).

**[Guitar Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Wolf)**[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Wolf): Ramones in Japan. All the members are named after their instrument + "Wolf". Fucking subliminal. It's a shame only Tidal has their album "_[Jet Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUabO1cZ1zo)_" up; catch it here.

Then there's people like **Herb Albert**. His song is about as _executively sleazy_ as he is on this fucking cover. Trying to define his shit is easy but simultaneously hard. How make this stuff without turning into a caricature of yourself? He didn't. What a guy. That song, "_Rise_", is a fucking _jam_. BTW, if you haven't heard Notorious B.I.G.'s "_Hypnotize_", do that too, because Biggie sampled the fuck out of that Herb track:

Speaking of fucking masters, **Hans-Joachim Rodelius and Christoph H. Müller** turn shit upside down with this ambient mass. Check out [Rodelius' track record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Joachim_Roedelius)! He fucking did Kluster and Harmonia, the latter with Brian Eno and [Michael Rother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rother) from Neu! Anyway, it's some good ambient shit. If you haven't heard this before and long for more, check out Kluster/Cluster/Qluster. Check [this fucking album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_%26_Eno) out! It's gorgeous. Rodelius is fucking 84 years old. What a fucking guy.

Then, there's **[Johnny Marr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Marr)**, who released "Spectral Eyes", his best b-side ever (not counting The Smiths), which is a grand track.

**[Descendents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descendents)**' "_I Like Food_" may be the best 17-second-long track.

Speaking of which, **[Ho99o9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho99o9)**, their style is punk and hip-hop but at the same time they're reminiscent of Death Grips. Still, this song fucking power vaults the hell out of you.

**[Vessel](https://vesseluk.bandcamp.com/album/queen-of-golden-dogs)** is like **The Knife** on this track. It's some good stuff. Check out that album and also hear song two, they're quite different.

Vessel. Another fucking good artist from Bristol, UK.

Hope you dig some of that stuff. Please let me know if you did or not.

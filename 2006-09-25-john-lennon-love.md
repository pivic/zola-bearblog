[![The U.S. vs. John Lennon](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000HKDEDI.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000HKDEDI%26tag=niklasblog-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000HKDEDI%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "View product details at Amazon")Seeing that the documentary "[The U.S. vs John Lennon](http://www.apple.com/trailers/lions_gate/theusvsjohnlennon)" is premiering (sadly not yet here in Sweden, but in the USA) it's appropriate to remember that Lennon was as successful as Gandhi in using non-violence to encourage people to abhor violence and abstain from using it; as this was the case, the US government wanted to silence him for his views on the matter, especially as he often aired his views on the terrorist stance the USA was taking, e.g. in Vietnam and Indochina.

I mean, there is proof that [the FBI tried to have him deported and covered his activities by spying and bugging him for a long time](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/lennon1.html) and they actually thought he'd "disturb the 1972 Republican National Convention", among other things. Wonderful.

Here's a track that shows Lennon's brilliantly gentle side; he plays and sings it himself. Don't worry, the track increases in volume and is beautiful in its fruition. What an effing hero he was. Don't forget to pick up the soundtrack, which sports [unreleased material](http://www.nme.com/news/john-lennon/23758), and don't miss [the site](http://www.theusversusjohnlennon.com).

The track's history in a week, just so you know.

[![Tove](http://static.flickr.com/44/138494494_7e4e22c332_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=138494494)The other day I received a voice-message in my mail-box [thanks to Odeo](http://odeo.com/sendmeamessage/Niklaspivic), but mostly thanks to Jonathan Crow, Marketing Director at [ThinkFree](http://thinkfree.com), a service that [I wrote about in September](https://niklasblog.com/?p=776).

They have now remarkably expanded the storage-space one gets: from 30MB to 1GB! Now, that's something for [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com) to think of, as they recently upped their ante from 20MB to 30MB a week. Anyway, I guess Vimeo has less cash.

I've temporarily moved my faux-MS-Excel-sheet from [iRows](http://irows.com) to ThinkFree to evaluate it further. ThinkFree does still incorporate Java (which [I almost hate more than war](http://www.google.se/search?q=hate+java&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official)) but once the program you desire to work with gets going, it's really flying with loads of clever functions. If you've ever used MS Office, you'll get going immediately, as the user interface is basically a rip-off, and I mean that in a good sense, although I'm really, really looking forward to the release of MS Office 2007. If you haven't seen it, catch [this video](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/ui/demo.mspx) that shows the suite as-is, in beta 1, TR1.

Today, I listened to Start The Week, where Debbie Isitt, director of "[Confetti](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427089)", spoke of how incredibly much improvisation played a part in creating the film. The actors were given roles, as three couples who all competed to win a wedding contest. The most original couple wins a Â£500,000 dream-house. The actors were given quite light pointers on their characters, and off they went - to improvise. Not a single bit of script was written before-hand, which proved to be a massive undertaking. I want to see it! And "[Tristram Shandy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423409)".

[![Jesper, leopard seal](http://static.flickr.com/44/138495765_e13b62df16_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=138495765)I got my [Line6 Spider II 30](http://www.line6.com/spiderii/30.html) yesterday! It is hellishly large in comparison with the old amp, but it's so much better. The bass really shines through the body of the new amp, and the sounds are massive. It's filled with features, most of which I won't be using due to my already owning a [Line6 podXT](http://line6.com/podxt). I can't wait to play it tonight. Let's just see how long before I get evicted. I've been listening to [Ronnie Spector](http://www.ronniespector.com)'s "[The Last Of The Rock Stars](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000E8R9UM/niklasblog-20)" a lot, so we'll see how long it takes before I start playing old-skool guitar the Keith Richards-way.

Speaking of guitars, Jesper just blew over 1000USD (!) on a brand-new [LTD EX-400](http://www.espguitars.com/guitars_ex.html)! We listened to it on a big Line6 rig, and it blew Jesper's mind. When he first laid eyes on [it](http://www.espguitars.com/images/guitars/EX-400_BLK.jpg "Jesper's guitar looks just like this.") he lifted it from its hold as if he was trying to catch Tove, his baby girl. Marie blessed Jesper on the purchase, and off he went - after we'd had a couple of beers to chill out and think about it twice. Congrats, you guitar-master! Now it's time for Jesper to take over the world just like [EMI is trying to take over Warner Music](http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/03/business/emi.php).

I just found out about [Def Poetry Jam](http://www.defpoetryjam.com), a live rap poetry show taped in front of a live studio audience, where different people do different stuff. I've just seen the first episode from the current, fourth season. [Mos Def](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=11:6yd3vwvya9ek) is the resident MC, and in this episode introduced a slew of intellectual people, of which most are quite young, who poured their hearts, their minds, their anger, love, hate, compassion et.c. onto the crowd who really dug them. It's a really good thing.

I'm waiting for a DVD release to come out of that show.

According to [a recent post](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/03/man-vs-mini-kitchen.html) in the Google blog, 50% of all [Extreme Energy drinks](http://www.silverbackextreme.com) are flammable.

I wonder if they poured the bad stuff on each-other, played with matches and then designed their web site.

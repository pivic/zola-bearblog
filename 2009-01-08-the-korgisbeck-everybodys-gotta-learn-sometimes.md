As "[Nip/Tuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nip/Tuck)" goes on into the second part of the fifth season, the premier episode was aired Sunday. That episode is art. Music-wise, I was really happy as well. Apart from playing The O'Jays "_[Backstabber](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MmJI036k-M)_", they walked into this one, The Korgis' hit single (both in England and the USA) from 1980; however, the producers of Nip/Tuck went for the version that Beck covered ((The track has actually been [covered numerous times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Korgis#Cover_versions), e.g. by Army of Lovers and Glasvegas.)) for the film "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind".

I love the analogue synth on the original, absolutely wonderfully mixed with the singer's fragile, [Jon Anderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Anderson)\-like voice. Here's the original, infused with loads of reverb, culled from a bootleg mix which is why it's a tad abridged both at the beginning and the end:

As far as Beck's version flies, I feel it's a remnant from his album "Sea Change", both in tone, sparse arrangement and dense sound. He does the track justice, even though it's quite alike the original:

Both versions will be history in one week.

**bonus**: The Korgis' video is available [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOqXy64-hTw), but I must warn you, it's quite bad in a 90s way. Glasvegas' cover is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzXP6R_9UDI).

We made our very own American pancakes and they turned out great. Next time we'll probably make it more Magnolia Café-style.

This kitty sometimes follows X and myself when we're going home from the subway. Some mornings, though, it's...

...it's slightly more reserved.

Yesterday X and I attended [an underwhelming exhibition](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/204/downloadyp.png/) at Nationalmuseum called "_[Lust & Last](http://www.nationalmuseum.se/sv/Besoka-museet/Utstallningar1/Aktuella1/Lust-och-last)_" ((In English, that's "Lust & Vice".)), which was filled with painting and drawings from a few centuries ago, and a few contraptions like the above chastity belt. There were far too few things from this century and the past, I think.

A funny thing was that the exhibition was supposed to take a look at how morals and ethics have changed and evolved, and just after having snapped the above shot, the guard who's on the left-hand side of the picture ran up to me and harshly let me know that no picture-taking was allowed.

The above character is called [Markus Fagervall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Fagervall). He once (in 2006) won the Swedish version of "American Idol", sold 81000 copies of his debut album and was nearly killed by yours truly while driving a car.

Anyway, I recently bought his album **for my mother-in-law**, and I found it like that. Five Swedish Crowns is less than a US Dollar. Still outrageously overpriced.

While [at Drop Coffee this past Friday](https://niklasblog.com/?p=7274) I had a little espresso from Honolulu Coffee which was amazing. Must have again.

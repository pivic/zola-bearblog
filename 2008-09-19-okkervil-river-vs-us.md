**edit**: we're on [the band's front page](http://okkervilriver.com/index.php) right now ((2008-09-22)). Weird and sweet.

A blog called Everybody Cares, Everybody Understands recently rallied for people to send their renditions of Okkervil River's brilliant track "_Lost Coastlines_", off their latest LP. Here's the track in its entirety:

X and I submitted two videos, one where she and I sat down in orderly fashion, sang the track and I played an acoustic guitar. We repeated this until we were happy - and until my paws were frikking bleeding from all the grinding - and submitted it.

But not until we'd recorded a much darker version.

As [Bj√∂rn and Kuba came over to party with us](http://flickr.com/photos/pivic/2820473223), we all got roaringly drunk and X had her senses intact enough to film us while singing, dancing and (me) poorly handling the guitar over OR's track playing in the background.

Here's the finished product including all the fan submissions that made it, courtesy of Chad at ECEU:

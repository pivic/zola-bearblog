\[avatar:/bilder/avatars/mikaela.jpg\]Mikaela\[/avatar\] received a royal gift from Moje, her grandmother. Also, we played a game of Trivial Pursuit. I'm a quite bad loser, but a worse winner; I won, shout out loudly, and photographed the whole thing. I'm the type of person I'd hate to lose to.

Check all the pictures out [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-05-18).

Also, I noticed that the Star Wars l33t trailer is removed due to a cease and desist-letter from t3H SuXX0rZ (aka George Lucas and his minions of 3v!L), but check this out: [the people who've made the trailer have translated the letter](http://nuar.lunarpages.com/video/SW_mirrors.htm). It's the FuNZ0rZ. Also, the original trailer can be found all over the web, for instance, [here](http://www.liveartists.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=145).

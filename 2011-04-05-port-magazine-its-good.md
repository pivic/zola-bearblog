I really, really like [PORT](http://port-magazine.com), a new, self-proclaimed "intelligent magazine for men". Not that I concur with it being "intelligent" nor "for men". Not for the first half of it, with the semi-interesting interviews and conclusions, though, but for the mini-essays inside of it. Robert Hughes' article on privacy is beautiful, as is the semi-connecting piece by [Frank Skinner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%20Skinner). [Jon Snow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon%20Snow)'s positive outlook on the future of journalism is fine and [Ekow Echun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekow%20Eshun)'s piece on modern culture is spot-on.

I also like the fact that [Hanif Kureishi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif%20Kureishi) is the music editor, and that the fashion pics somewhat speak to me; the day when I buy a Hermés scarf is far away, of course...

And I still haven't read [Will Self](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will%20Self)'s short-story, the long articles nor any of the poetry!

All in all, this is like a brother to [The Paris Review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris%20Review); in fact, PORT has interviewed [Lorin Stein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorin%20Stein), the Editor of The Paris Review, for this number.

It would need a little more effort in getting out of the "men's magazine" section, even there is no nudge-nudge mentality in it. Yet.

It's themeless but filled with love! This is some really eclectic songs without my trying to be speschul, which is when I think mixtapes are best compiled.

1\. **Noviciat de Soeurs Missionaires de Notre-Dame d'Afrique & four religious drummers** - "Yesu Ka Mkwebase"

Reminiscent of The Dixie Cups' "[Iko Iko](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n04ws2nzXpk)", I love this track. Solemn, soulful.

2\. **Glasvegas** - "It's My Own Cheating Heart That Makes Me Cry"

Mixing an American English accent with a native Glaswegian one makes for an interesting voice; this is one of the hottest upcoming acts of 2008, [apparently](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1389), and I'm eagerly awaiting their LP instead of lone tracks being released on vinyl. This band grows on me and the singer reminds me of [Johnnie Ray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Ray) - in a good way.

3\. **Beck** - "Chemtrails"

Interesting psychedelic stuff off his coming effort with Danger Mouse, his LP "Modern Guilt" makes for the most interesting release since "Sea Changes".

4\. **Black Ghosts** - "Repetition \[Diplo Remix\]"

I don't care much for Black Ghosts, but I do care for Diplo's well-honed remixing skills! Bring it on!

5\. **Mogwai** - "Yes! I Am A Long Way From Here"

Fresh off [the reissued "Young Team"](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/48167-mogwai-reissue-iyoung-teami-for-tenth-anniversary), i.e. Mogwai's debut album, here's the opening track displaying how the Mogs walk the walk just like Explosions In The Sky and their likes, yet holding their own. Boo-ya!

6\. **Dirty Pretty Things** - "Tired Of England"

Having been hospitalised recently, [Carl returned home to rest today](http://www.dirtyprettythingsband.com/index.php/news/more/update_carl_released_from_hospital), yeay! Awaiting the band's second album to be released on 2008-06-30, here's their first single.

7\. **Edu feat. Madame Mim** - "Headbanger"

Here's a bit of early 90's synths and 00's dance. Brazilian. Bad. Good.

8\. **Soul Position** - "Hand-Me-Downs"

Brilliant hip-hop in the native tongues-sense of the word, [RJD2](http://www.rjd2site.com) and [Blueprint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint_(rapper)) match up to deliver rump-shaking actions about DIY and not accepting benefits. Sooo good.

9\. **Rage Against the Machine** - "Killing in the Name of (SebastiAn's Late Night Laptop Edit)"

Somehow this has spread around the net as Mr. Oizo's edit, but really, it's SebastiAn again. It's a late night-edit, really nicely done.

10\. **Les Fatals Picards** - "L'amour à€ La Franà§aise"

This is the song that represented France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. The video is absolutely brilliant, so see it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4VcSQE7DXg). Really, any band who stitches a cat onto one singer's shoulder gets my vote.

11\. **Mystery Jets** - "Two Doors Down"

[They](http://www.myspace.com/mysteryjets)'re back! They're back! Their second album, "Twenty One", is already out and produced by [Erol Alkan](http://www.erolalkan.co.uk) out of all people, and the video for this track, the first single, is found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2Dl3VQ2K2U); mind you, the version I've included in my muxtape is rare and done for the BBC, so you won't find the wonderful string-arrangement anywhere else.

12\. **A Hawk And A Hacksaw** - "In The River"

I saw this strong bunch live at ATP ((And actually while waiting for their flight at Bristol Airport.)), where they played a lot of great Balkan-sounding music with English vocals. Earthy, danceable, making a stance in a drab day. [Do listen](http://www.myspace.com/ahawkandahacksaw) and do purchase their latest album.

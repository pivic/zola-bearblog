Bended knee, honeymoon  
Nursery, another soon  
Into my mind, the thought begins to seep  
If no one's fond of fucking me  
Maybe no one's fucking fond of me  
Yeah, maybe I'm the only one for me

[This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGCJ_aUHdu4) is much better than most of what I've ever photographed. It's the last song off the Purple Mountains album.

Oh, you have to get it; get it [here](https://www.dragcity.com/products/purple-mountains).

I'm a bit scared of [Shirley Bassey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Bassey)'s judgment. First of all, her voice has served the world through a string of undeniable hits like "Big Spender", "Diamonds Are Forever", "Goldfinger" and she was a brilliant artist. Hold on. She's not dead. She _is_ a brilliant artist. Or maybe not, for if she really is, why has she just released a cover of Pink's "Get The Party Started"? ((The Guardian writes a blurb about the cover [here](http://music.guardian.co.uk/pop/reviews/story/0,,2108217,00.html).)) Check it out at [her MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/shirleybassey). Her performance of said track at Glastonbury this year is viewable [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnK5oSILJ3A). Part of me thinks her voice is best remembered on the beforementioned tracks, not to forget her massive achievement on Propellerheads' "[History Repeating](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnZiPhaBqF8)".

Or maybe I'd rather just give you something I really love. [Babyshambles](http://www.babyshambles.net) are back, having just finished (according to Mr. Doherty on [Jonathan Ross' recent interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VXN9TNnuBY) where you can hear Pete performing a new track that's called "The Lost Art Of Murder") the follow-up to their debut album, "[Down in Albion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babyshambles#Debut_album)". Nobody knows when it'll be released, but anyway, three cheers to Pete's gift of gab and brilliant song-writing.

Here's a brilliant live-version ((Done for MySpace Secret Gigs.)) of "[From Bollywood To Battersea](http://www.lyricsmania.com/lyrics/babyshambles_lyrics_4532/lyrics_14660/bollywood_to_battersea_lyrics_175995.html)" performed ten days ago.

I've done a solo Okkervil River-cover, of the song "_On Tour With Zykos_", from their most recent album, "The Stand Ins". Available in two qualities, you'll find it below courtesy of Vimeo (higher quality) and YouTube (lower quality) right below. God, the song's so strong. I don't believe I do it justice, but just grabbing a guitar and singing to it is what enticed me to go this way to begin with.

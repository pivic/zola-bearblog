[![Amy Winehouse](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/10271612_652456444830543_8869326163480677744_n.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/10271612_652456444830543_8869326163480677744_n.jpg)

Three years have passed since one of the most talented, troubled and thoughtful songwriters died.

People either seem to think of her as a very good singer or/and a junkie, and even though that's true, her lyrics had a lot of well-written hurt and love in them, as well as scorn, fun and sex. She managed to be both subtle and frank.

I remember reading that she'd died that evening on the 23rd of July in 2011. X was shocked as I told her, and I was, too. I still think it's weird to think of her as being completely gone, never to return; I feel as though she'll turn up and sing the pants off us all, detoxed and happy. She was almost there, in a way.

Here's a rare and lovely remix of one of her tracks, "_Love Is A Losing Game_", which is a remix that I really like, with added strings and an electric piano. It'll be gone in a week.

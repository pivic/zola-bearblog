I saw some Sparks fly yesterday.

Ron and Russell Mael ended their "Revenge of Two Hands, One Mouth" world tour at Södra Teatern. Some of the highlights from the gig included Ron's dancing (naturally), Russell explaining that thanks to some Swedish backers, a feature film will be made with Sparks' Ingmar Bergman project as background, beautiful words on mysteries were sang and the brothers were handed applause and thanks for almost five minutes before going. They were very, very grateful. Lovely to see.

Here's an entire Google+ album for this:

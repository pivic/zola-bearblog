Well, we did see shows:

Note Patrick's voice-over to Justin's piano vamp around the 2:30-mark...very "**Cheers**". And yes, Will's voice is on par around 04:29, albeit in a parallel universe. And Pat's backing vocal during "_No Key, No Plan_" was pretty. Naw. Good work, Pat. Will, god **damn** it... :D I shouldn't say anything, doing my rodent-trapped-in-a-metal-device thing around 08:00.

and then there's

**Neon Indian**

Mr. Palomo is a really nice guy. And I love how the bass made my camera vibrate during the bass parts. _Adam Ant never had that going for him._

By Jove, he's the troubled child that Dick Hyman and Billy Fury should have spawned.

You can still see a very palpable difference between his behaviour to the new album as compared to the new shit, just first check out 09:15, then 09:25. Still... I must say it. I miss tracks like "_I Should Have Taken Acid With You_" on the later album. Although his collaboration with The Flaming Lips nearly makes up for it.

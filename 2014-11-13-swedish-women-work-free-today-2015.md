[![Antifeminism](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/Anti-feminism-posts-are-kinda-stupid_564688_5087662.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/Anti-feminism-posts-are-kinda-stupid_564688_5087662.jpg)

In Sweden, women earn approximately 86% of what men earn.

This could be translated as follows: from today, the 12th of November, women work for free until the 1st of January 2015.

The gap is predicted by some to narrow around the year 2082.

When will antifeminism be highlighted the way it deserves, i.e. as a danger to society, rather than _a female problem_ (which it is not), and be dealt with as one of the highest political priorities by all?

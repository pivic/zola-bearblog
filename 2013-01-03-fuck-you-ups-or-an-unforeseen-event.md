[![Fuck you, UPS](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2013-01-03_1555-2.png "Fuck you, UPS")](https://niklasblog.com/?attachment_id=12600)

**me**: Hi, I would like to know what "Exception" really means in this case as I called you yesterday, and you _promised_ me I'd get my package today. **UPS**: Yeah, well, we've had a _lot_ of packages to deliver today.

Hello? Is this the fucking Brain Trust? Here's a question for you: when does UPS not have a lot of packages to deliver?

**me**: Well...yes, but I was promised to get the package today. _Will_ I get it today? **UPS**: We've had 17 extra cars ordered in today just to deliver more packages.

Had I called a politician by mistake?

**me**: So...will I get my package today? **UPS**: We're working as fast as we can, but...

Insert ten-second pause here.

**me**: Hello? **UPS**: You will get your package tomorrow. **me**: What! So, I won't get it today, I get that, but...can you _guarantee_ that I will get it tomorrow? **UPS**: You will get it tomorrow. **me**: Great. Can you please call me if another unforeseen event occurs or something like that? I've tried-- **UPS**: You can register for text messages to be sent to your mobile phone if you need that. **me**: I was about to say that I've registered for that twice already, _but it did and does not work_; I haven't received anything at all. Can you please call me if anything happens tomorrow that prevents me from getting my package on time?

Insert twenty-second pause here.

**me**: Hello? **UPS**: No. **me**: Sorry, you can't guarantee that, or what? **UPS**: No.

Apparently, _what_ is the word at UPS. Idiots.

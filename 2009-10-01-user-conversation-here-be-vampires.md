I'm at work and a user suddenly appears in my room.

**user**: Hello. Are you Niklas? **I**: Hello! Yes, I am Niklas. **u**: Has no-one else been in touch with you?

The user says this with a sly expression on her face. I don't quite know what to make of it. Who else? My mind races. _Alien abductions? Conspiracy theorists? Have I won the lotto?_

**I**: I'm sorry, but I don't know what you are referring to. Who are you? **u**: We spoke a while back. A few days ago. Has anybody else been in touch?

The user says this with a stern face, white complexion and hands flailing. I feel as though somebody's putting me on.

**I**: I'm sorry, but I still don't know what you are referring to. Would you please be more specific? **u**: Excel.

Alright. I teach MS Excel 2007, but this is hardly specific.

**I**: I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are, exactly what you are referring to or what you would like me to help you with. Can you please be more specific?

The sly expression is exchanged for one of distrust.

**u**: You told me that you couldn't teach a class consisting of just me. **I**: I don't remember any specific conversation that you and I may have had, but I cannot hold classes with fewer or more than four people. Those are my orders.

The user folds her arms and squints.

**u**: Alright. I see. But...aren't there any three people interested in Excel, you think?

She says "think" as though she's just forced me into checkmate and I've yet to grasp it.

**I**: There might be, but as I don't keep lists of people who are interesting in attending this course you either have to attract three more persons and I can create a course date for you, or-- **u**: \[loudly and slowly while in crescendo\] Ooor?

Even though I am quite taken aback by this, trying to think about what to do next, I soldier on. What else can I do?

**I**: --or you must wait until I publish the dates for the four courses I am to teach in 2010. **u**: When will you publish the dates? Oh, it's _not_ important for me to know.

Following this, the user just stares at me. I stare back.

**u**: When will you publish them? **I**: Probably in November, with the first course in February. **u**: So, book me for a course in February. **I**: Well, you will be able to do that yourself as-- **u**: But the course isn't available yet! You haven't published it! **I**: ...exactly. But when I do-- **u**: You will e-mail us!

I have no idea what she meant by "us", but I'm sure _the rest_ will listen. Somehow. And I'm sure _they glitter_.

**I**: No, but the course is available through the intranet. **u**: \[put on glasses and stared into my computer screen\] **I**: ...would you like me to show you where you can find the course on the intranet? **u**: No. Thank you. I will be in touch.

She quickly leaves. Very vampire-ishly. Didn't glitter, though.

Yahoo! has bought [Konfabulator](http://www.konfabulator.com), a program that previously has cost 20USD, and will release it for free. More on that [here](http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/07/24/konfabulator/index.php).

At almost the same time, Microsoft are releasing [Virtual Earth](http://www.virtualearth.com), an application that 1) seems to take its aim at [Google Earth](https://niklasblog.com/?p=681), 2) doesn't work with Mozilla Firefox and 3) today contains very little functionality compared with Google Earth.

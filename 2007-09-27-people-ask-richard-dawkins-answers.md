[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR_z85O0P2M) shows [Richard Dawkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins), famous evolutionary biologist and author, answering questions mostly on religion from people, many of which are Jerry Falwell's students. A memorable quote (which isn't as high horsey as it may sound, but is more compelling in context; for that, please see the video) from Dawkins:

> Somebody once suggested that organising atheists is a bit like herding cats: they are, on the whole, too intelligent and independent-minded to lend themselves to being herded.

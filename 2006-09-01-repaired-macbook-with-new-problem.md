[![Dik-Dik, lifted](http://static.flickr.com/94/230058949_9e0cd195f5_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=230058949) This Monday I was called by [LAN Master](http://www.lan-master.se), who left a detailed message on my answering-machine, saying they'd fixed my MacBook. Terrific! Most of the time consisted of waiting for parts, so Apple took their time. All in all, I waited 12 work-days for it to get fixed. So, is everything alright with it? _No_.

When I left it for service, I (of course, and at the behest of LAN Master) swapped my 2\*1GB Kingston memory-capsules for the 2\*256MB memory-capsules that were included with the retail computer. When I got the computer back, I noticed I had to PMU reset-the-PRAM-it to life, i.e. press Cmd+Alt+P+R and then the power-button, in order for it to start correctly. When these keys were not pushed as I started it, the screen went a hazy grey and wouldn't boot.

Anyway, I then proceeded with applying the latest MacBook firmware and followed up by using the computer some. No shutdowns yet, thank Gawd, but _every single time_ I turn it on, I have to restart with PMU'ing it resetting the PRAM. If this keeps up the weekend through, it's going back to LAN Master. Do note that this behaviour continued after I swapped the memory-capsules (for my 2\*1GB's).

People are really starting to wonder [what sort of quality control Apple are pushing](http://www.macuser.com/hardware/is_apples_quality_control_goin.php), and if there are [other problems afoot](http://www.macuser.com/hardware/tales_of_iffy_dvd_drives.php).

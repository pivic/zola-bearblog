[![Dinner](http://static.flickr.com/22/33432801_91e275f324_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=33432801) Yes! [Magnus](http://www.dn.se/content/1/c6/54/57/59/Nitty%20Gritty%20Ca425.jpg "Yep, looks like Magnus, alright.") has [won Gulddraken](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=625&a=545759&previousRenderType=1) in the café-category; "Gulddraken" translates as "The Golden Dragon", which is a quite prestigious award that Dagens Nyheter annually has inflicted upon us Stockholmians since a bunch of years back.

The jury had this to say regarding their selection:

> Excellent place to have a coffee-break, food and lunches presented in a well thought-through menu, with personal and stress-free service, at reasonable prices in an environment despite of which, or maybe because of, the place remains quite secret in.

I wish I could explain what ordering the **[Lady Gaga Super Deluxe The Fame Monster Pack](http://ladygaga.shop.bravadousa.com/Product.aspx?cp=14781_25077&pc=BGCDLG03)** means to me, but I'd just fall short. Indeed, I'm flustered. Even though I think the album will be leaked/sold in the stores weeks before I lay my paws on the physical copy, I must say I feel intensively satisfied to have ordered it. Most people will probably deem me a pop idiot for ordering it, but fuck 'em. That's what people said about the Ramones so I'm strengthened by it. Not to mention what a freakingly fabulous mench she is, the Gaga. I always have a tough time with trying to define her to people who _think_ they feel annoyed by "_Poker Face_" but haven't even listened to the lyrics and laughed at/with the character of the song.

I won't get further into that. All I can do is eh-eh and reminisce to reading an article that Lester Bangs ((Whom is worshipped in credible music circles, even though he loved ABBA as much as Van Der Graaf Generator, which points to the fact that time is eternal I think this is yet another field where idiots slag GaGa based on the fact that she's successful and female.)) wrote about a fire lighting up the apartment complex where he lived; as he fled the building the sole thing he brought with him was a copy of P.I.L.'s "**[Metal Box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Box)**".

I'm telling you, if the apartment complex that I live in starts to burn and bend, I'm taking X under one arm, the cats on my back and the (so far non-existant) box under the other arm and make a break for it! And my Smiths collection. And all my Morrissey CDs. And The Stone Roses first album (and possibly the second). And--

ENOUGH!

Apart from the coming single, "_Bad Romance_", the second track, "_[Alejandro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVX7Wzje8jE)_", has already leaked onto the Internet (in horrific quality). Despite the first track being terrific pop, the second one just deafens me with its dark, reverb-laden sine-waves washing me out.

Judging from the two tracks that are currently out, GaGa's playful sensibilities are still in-place (just listen to the spoken word intro in "_Alejandro_") and she still obviously writes kicking tracks!

Right now my local favourite café/baker, [Lilla Bagis](https://www.facebook.com/lillabagis/), is displaying art by [Karin Efraim](https://www.facebook.com/KarinEfraimHenriksson). I cannot overstate how much I like the everyday subjects combined with the curse words and abstract shit. It's like a breath of fresh air in comparison with the everyday shit art you see in most places (methinks). The pictures were taken with permission of Lilla Bagis:

Could translate to "Shut up, fucking bird".

"Everything's shit."

DAMN DAMN HELL

As above, even though "HELVETE" (=Hell) is divided; the two words by themselves are "whole" and "wheat" which may give off a nice extra ring as the art is hung at a café/bakers.

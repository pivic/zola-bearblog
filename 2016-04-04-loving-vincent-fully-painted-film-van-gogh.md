There's a film coming, and it's all about my favourite painter **[Vincent van Gogh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh)**. I urge you to check out this trailer, which looks able to retain some of van Gogh's spirit from the paintings:

That's 12 oil paintings flashing by the eye per second. It's the first fully painted feature film in the world, according to the creators, who are calling for artists to join and help out. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the film to turn out good, instead of mere special effects. The film makes me yearn back to [the van Gogh museum in Amsterdam](http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en), the visit to which was a blissful experience. Seeing people like [Père Tanguy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_P%C3%A8re_Tanguy) in the trailer above, along with scenery from [Arles](http://www.vangoghgallery.com/in_his_steps/arles.html)...oh, my heart.

I just hope the film keeps van Gogh in mind, and not the flashy, non-descriptive bits that aren't really interesting ((Yes, the chopping-off of the ear.)) and instead focus on stuff like his early Christian vocation, the Asian influences in his art, his relationships with his brother Theo and the painter [Paul Gauguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gauguin).

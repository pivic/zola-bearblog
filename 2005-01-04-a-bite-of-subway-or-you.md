[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-01-04-mariatorget.gif)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-01-04-mariatorget.jpg)Today DN publishes [an article](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=145&a=361706) showing that the air in the subway system in Stockholm contains up to ten times the amount of contamination than can be found in the most contaminated streets of Stockholm. The contaminations, i.e. particles that hurt the lung system, are far more evident in the subway system than at ground level.

The photo to the right in this article, shot by world-renowned photographer [Lennart Nilsson](http://www.rit.edu/~mrppph/nilsson/bio.html), shows how particles attack a piece of iron metal. That's aggressive, folks. And it's actually shot in a subway-station called Mariatorget, whereto I venture nearly every week-day as I get off there for work. I don't work in the station, but a little bit away from there. It's amazing to see what these little creatures get up to.

Speaking of which, Mikaela's work-mate åsa came by today for dinner, together with her 4-year-old son, Charlie. He played "Spider-Man 2" on my PS2 with much enthusiasm. åsa is the mother of [Frasse](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-12-06-frasse.jpg), a kitten her family will be receiving in three weeks' time. It was nice having them over. I'm always anxious at the mere thought of meeting kids, then love the feeling once I'm actually together with them. It'll be fun having kids of our own. Oh, Mikaela had made a nice spaghetti with meat-sauce, enough meat in that to drown a small goat. I love meat-sauces that are rich with meat and not merely made up of something making the sauce more akin to broth than a sauce. We later watched Bourdain \[actually pronounced Bore-daine by himself, what a tribute to his French roots, n'est c'est pas?\] traipse across the globe in search of food to tickle his senses. Among some things, he went to Los Angeles and ate a 12" hot dog. That's somewhere along 30-36 centimeters of sausage, for us poundally (!) challenged. And no, Patrik, that's not what you're thinking of. Bourdain also visited a village in Mexico, from where at least four of his workers at his (and when I write "his" I mean the place where he's the head chef) Brasserie Les Halles in New York were spawned. He tried their tortillas, goat's head-soup, enchiladas and other delicacies which all looked fantastic and mouth-watering. Mikaela and I actually spent a little time tonight, roaming the cupboards, cabinets, the fridge and the freezer, in search of something delicate. Mikaela settled on a fresh piece of bread that she had picked up today at Skärholmen (the best part south of town, apart from Fittja, Hallunda and Norsborg, where you can pick up fresh and quite cheap vegetables, delicacies and bakery products) together with some butter, and I craved a fresh salad with cocktail tomatoes and leek. So good. Now it's time to sleep, ciao.

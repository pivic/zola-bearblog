I hope people realise that islamophobia not only exists, but kills; it should be critiqued and debunked every time its head is reared.

I don't adhere to a religion, nor do I support any of the major religions; I firmly believe that open, tolerant, and inclusive persons who believe in humanism should always be treated respectfully; this also goes for persons who find solace in supernatural rules, e.g. religion and capitalism.

For those of you who struggle to find a common denominator in all of this:

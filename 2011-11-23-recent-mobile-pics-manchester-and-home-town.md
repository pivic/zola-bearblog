Yes, my Manchester post is probably coming this weekend, I hope! Right now, just thinking of transferring and converting more than 300 pictures is a somewhat daunting thought...but it shall be done. Here be some mobile pics from the past week anyway!

From Arlanda Airport, before leaving for the UK.

...[Slim Shady](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNPnbI1arSE). I've no idea why the above pic makes me think of that song.

While this picture is quite shitty - I just took the picture because I was a little amazed that somebody'd bought huge ads trying to sell martial arts classes because Jeet Kune Do is a hybrid martial arts system and life philosophy founded by martial artist Bruce Lee ((Thank you, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeet_Kune_Do).)). Anyway, almost every building in Manchester struck me this way: big, quite old, brownish bricks in various stages of dilapidation.

Upon entering a place called Night & Day one lunchtime, we accidentally discovered that Neon Indian were playing there, that very evening. What's the chance? We couldn't buy tickets but a very kind man wrote our names down to make sure we'd get in later. We did, actually met and spoke with Mr. Palomo who was very nice and cool. Of course Neon Indian was good live. More pics and video to come of that when converted...

Ancient jukebox courtesy of Pop Boutique. They actually had another one, too.

Took me ages to decipher that name! Found on Kings Road in Stretford, the very road where Morrissey grew up. Guess why we went there?

A little cup we got at the [Manchester Visitor Information Centre](http://www.manchester.gov.uk/visitorcentre).

...and this! Woo, somebody's refurnishing Liljeholmen using LSD!

OK, returning to Stockholm is very lovely in its ways...especially when you stop to see this in the morning.

A friend tipped me about [www.outfoxed.org](http://www.outfoxed.org), a site which displays information on a film called "Outfoxed". I haven't seen this documentary, but it sounds promising. From the film-makers' site:

> Outfoxed examines how media empires, led by Rupert Murdoch's Fox News, have been running a "race to the bottom" in television news. This film provides an in-depth look at Fox News and the dangers of ever-enlarging corporations taking control of the public's right to know.

Europeans have come across Murdoch in a variety of ways, without even knowing it. This man has changed the political views of some of the greatest daily papers in Europe, by force of money and his enormous influence. See Al Franken's "Liars" for interesting views on Murdoch, e.g. his decision to pull BBC from the entire People's Republic of China until he had his political ways.

Europeans are more accustomed to [Silvio Berlusconi](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3034600.stm), a very dangerous man, quite close to fascism. He owns a very large part of the Italian media, and by that I mean over 75%.

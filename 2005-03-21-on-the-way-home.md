Sitting at the stone-and-concrete station that is Hornstull, listening to an advance copy of Beck's "Guero", is a very calming experience.

Sure, I'm tired. I imagined I'd get to read a little of Frank Miller's "Give Me Liberty" when home, but what the hell. The pleasure of being tired is (at some times) underestimated.

Soon the bed will greet me. It's 20 minutes left until then, though, and "Guero" is great. Good-night.

![The Bicycles](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-11-07-thebicycles.jpg)I've just stumbled across "Oh No, It's Love", what so far ((Hey, I've only listened to it once and am hooked.)) seems like a brilliant album by indie rock-band [The Bicycles](http://thebicycles.ca). It's joyous shit! They're a four-piece from Canada and are just releasing their second album; 19 tracks, 31 minutes. Twee meets bubblegum pop. It's as if [Silver Sun](http://www.silver-sun.co.uk) had a calm baby. I'm happy from listening to this, and the band's definitely got a sense of yuma. Just click the play-button after this little quote and you'll understand it:

> You could have been a cult leader! Or a philosopher! And those are two groups of people we choose to avoid, remember?

Guard your heart, peoples. Anyway, the band's tight and yet seemingly relaxed. Just try this sample, the first track off their album that's brand new. I love the hip-hop drums!

You can hear more of their music at [their Myspace page](http://www.myspace.com/thebicycles) and buy it from iTunes or [here](http://www.fuzzylogicrecordings.com/shop.html). Two downloadable tracks are available [here](http://www.fuzzylogicrecordings.com/thebicycles.html).

As usual, the tracks will be deleted after a weeks' passed. Buy the album!

I've just found four very good and different tracks on Soundcloud, so why not share them?

**Lightning Bolt**'s "_King Candy_" from the forthcoming rarities EP titelled "Oblivion Hunter":

**Mumbai Science**'s latest mix with tracks by artists like John Roman, Boys Noize, JÃ¤gerverb and AEROTRONIC:

Whoa! [**The Avalanches**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avalanches) are coming back with a demo that features none other than [**David Berman**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Berman_%28musician%29), partly the man who formed Silver Jews; it's the first bit of music Berman's made since disbanding the Silver Jews to fight his republican father!

For those who remember, The Avalanches released a dreamy, mixed-up album called "_[Since I Left You](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Since_I_Left_You)_", which you must simply hear if you haven't.

Then there's the Danish Brainshakaz label, spearheaded by Matthew Took, where **Braincrack** have unleashed the following drum 'n' bass howler, enough to compete with some Ed Rush & Optikal if you ask me:

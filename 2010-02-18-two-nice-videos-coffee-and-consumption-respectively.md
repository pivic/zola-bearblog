This one's courtesy of [Verve coffee roasters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_qM0DGU2I) on how they think you can best enjoy your [espresso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso "Espresso"):

...and this one's made by [Dan Meyer](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?page_id=2) who shows off his consumption for an entire year; I like it a lot, even though it's scary aspergeroid (and the production process is very well-described [here](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=5668)):

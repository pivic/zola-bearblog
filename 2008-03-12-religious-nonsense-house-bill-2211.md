Kaveh just sent me a link to House Bill 2211, which is real, almost certainly about to become law in Oklahoma and readable [here](http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:wS8Pbo3AKhkJ:webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2007-08HB/HB2211_int.rtf+House+Bill+2211&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=se&client=firefox-a); so, what is it about?

From [this article](http://www.edmondsun.com/opinion/local_story_067125346.html) in _The Edmond Sun_:

> The bill requires public schools to guarantee students the right to express their religious viewpoints in a public forum, in class, in homework and in other ways without being penalized. If a student's religious beliefs were in conflict with scientific theory, and the student chose to express those beliefs rather than explain the theory in response to an exam question, the student's incorrect response would be deemed satisfactory, according to this bill.

This means - if this bill is passed, and things do actually look that way - that if a christian student says the Earth is 6000 or 12000 years old, those notions would be deemed as correct in a classroom in Oklahoma, alongside any answer that's based on scientific evidence (as opposed to the aforementioned delusional idiocy). I wonder if this will expand, e.g. force [women to be obedient to men](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/1cor/14.html#34), and [letting a couple of bears kill 42 children because one of them's mocked a bald person](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/2kg/2.html#23) ((I seriously wish I was making this shit up.)). Of course, this expands to muslims, mormons and other kinds of people who live their lives according to fiction and call it "religion".

Does it mean I can create a religion, live by my own laws in class and be 100% correct? Must be OK, right? Sign me up, Oklahoma!

Even though a lot of [Americans do have drugs in their drinking-water](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=4416882), this is just unfathomable for anybody who mainly uses their brain for reasonable, rational thinking.

As [Richard Dawkins](http://richarddawkins.net) cannot do it better, I'll let wonderful, dead [Bill Hicks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hicks) comment this debacle in an edited brilliant monologue on fundamentalist christians:

_It seemed so plausible, aaah!_

Last night I dreamt that a friend and I walked through [Hallunda Centrum](http://www.hallundacentrum.se), a mall in the town where I grew up.

It was late in the night and as we walked the old, granite flooring that paved the closed-for-the-night mall, our steps echoed through the long paths. We walked past an old electronics-shop and I saw the keys were left in the lock. No-one was in the shop.

As this was a dream, I turned the key and the door opened. Right inside the place was a box with a handle on it. I zipped the box open and found a projector. I zipped it shut, took the box with me and locked the door, leaving the keys in the lock. My friend and I then left.

We went to my place, where I plugged in the projector and let it shine at the big, white wall in our living-room; a picture appeared, and it was a picture of my friend.

"Look, that's you!" I said. "Yeah, it's me," she replied.

We looked at each-other and smiled. The end.

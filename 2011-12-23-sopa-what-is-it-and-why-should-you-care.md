Here's a brief intro to SOPA, an acronym for an American act that might the Stop Online Piracy Act, from "[SOPA for Dummies](http://www.scribd.com/doc/76244080/SOPA-for-Dummies)":

> SOPA explicitly states that companies will be liable for everything their users post. Sites like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Wikipedia, or any sites that allow user generated content CANNOT exist under these laws. Immediately after this bill is passed, you will see the media mafia (MPIAA, RIAA, etc) replacing websites like Wikipedia with commercialized encyclopedia software. Mainstream media outlets will not cover this bill because they are the ones lobbying for it.

One of the biggest domain registrars - i.e. companies through which you can register domain names - in the world is the American GoDaddy. [They have supported SOPA a lot](http://www.thedomains.com/2011/11/15/here-is-godaddys-statement-in-support-of-the-stop-online-privacy-act-house-hearing-tomorrow).

Now, some really remarkable and brilliant people have responded to this.

[**The Cheezburger network** threatens to pull 1000 (!) domains from GoDaddy](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/12/22/cheezburger-ceo-threatens-to-yank-1000-domains-from-godaddy-over-sopa-support) unless they do something about it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>We will move our 1,000 domains off @<a href="https://twitter.com/godaddy">godaddy</a> unless you drop support of SOPA. We love you guys, but <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523SOPA">#SOPA</a>-is-cancer to the Free Web.</p>â€” benhuh (@benhuh) <a href="https://twitter.com/benhuh/status/149965881479397376" data-datetime="2011-12-22T21:33:47+00:00">December 22, 2011</a></blockquote>

[**Y Combinator**](http://ycombinator.com), a company that seeds funding for startups, state that [SOPA-supporting companies are not allowed at their demo day](http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/22/paul-graham-sopa-supporting-companies-no-longer-allowed-at-yc-demo-day).

[More and more](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nmnie/godaddy_supports_sopa_im_transferring_51_domains) leave GoDaddy, and there's [a good how-to on this at Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5870649/ditch-godaddys-sopa+loving-butt-and-get-a-better-web-host-at-a-discount).

[Here](http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/22/over-40-internet-companies-have-come-out-publicly-against-sopa)'s a list of 40 companies that have spoken out against SOPA, but there are [120 companies that supports it](http://judiciary.house.gov/issues/Rouge%20Websites/SOPA%20Supporters.pdf).

Now, how does GoDaddy respond to all of this? Simple. They [re-hash their stance and turn off commenting](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/12/23/go-daddy-publishes-position-on-sopa-and-turns-off-blog-commenting).

Here's to further backlashing! Riot!

This might be one of the most underrated videos ever. So, in a sneaky way to make it more well-known, here it is. I'm a sucker for videos in slow-motion and this is a good 'un, delving through emotions as felt by the main artist and his motions. The video's really good-looking to boot; must be because [David LaChapelle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%20LaChapelle) directed it.

And yes, that's [Justin Timberlake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/justin%20timberlake) as [Elton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton%20John).

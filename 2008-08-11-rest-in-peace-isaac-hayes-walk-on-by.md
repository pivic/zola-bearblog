![Isaac Hayes](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/129/405012441_3befdfcc02.jpg) "_So deep, suggestive and sensitive._"

The man is dead at 65 years of age. For those of you not familiar with his madness other than being a scientologist who got what he deserved through "South Park" at the end, check his history.

Nobody other could make tracks that descended into funk-psych madness like him, including his voice. I'm sure he scared Barry White at times. [This track](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk_on_By) is originally written by Bacharach/David for Dionne Warwick, with whom Hayes performed a lot. Nowadays tracks are often past the 4-minute mark, but this one's 12 minutes long. He was prone to do things like that, stretching tracks far and wide, adding an orchestra to mallet that melody into you until you swayed and bowed down to his voice.

And this track's off an album called "[Hot Buttered Soul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Buttered_Soul)". With an album title like that, who can go wrong? Enjoy. It's gone in a week.

[MS06-001](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/ms06-001.mspx), a.k.a. "Vulnerability in Graphics Rendering Engine Could Allow Remote Code Execution (912919)" has just been released, which means the following: if you're running MS Windows, patch your computer now by clicking [this link](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/ms06-001.mspx) and following the instructions.

Paul Thurrott has just written a piece on Office 12, check it out [here](http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/office12_inside.asp). Personally, I think the hype about the Office 12 ribbon will die quite soon after Office 12 is released, when people realise two things: 1) it's not worth anybody's time to be scared of because 2) you'll realise it will save you lots of time. And there's a lot under the hood of Office 12, check [my old, lengthy post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=774) about Office 12 about more on this, plus [another one](https://niklasblog.com/?p=823) on the new file formats and XML stuff, and there's even more from [this search for it](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?s=office+12).

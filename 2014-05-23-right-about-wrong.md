Please read [David Foster Wallace's speech at Kenyon College](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/20/fiction); I like it so very much. It's a lot of words on life, on perhaps going down negative routes automatically and changing that into realising potential, without him being a moral moron about it. "He reflects on the difficulties of daily life and 'making it to 30, or maybe 50, without wanting to shoot yourself in the head'".

I wish I'd heard it when graduating. Still, it's there now and it's never to late to change what you wanna change, y'know.

"The trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness."

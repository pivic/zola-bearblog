As it's DJ-night tonight, I spent yesterday evening hunched over my records, burning new ones into the night. I love being possessed by songs. It's little wonder that I started looking in my old CaseLogic-bag and got enthralled with playing some tracks, e.g. Frankie Valli's "_The Night_", Mr. Bloe's "_Groovin' With Mr. Bloe_" and Dusty Springfield's "_Magic Garden_". Not to mention Gorillaz' masterpiece lazyitis track with Shaun Ryder - "[DARE](http://pivic.posterous.com/gorillaz-dare)". For example.

All of those songs have been on my mind to and fro for weeks, even years at a time.

Thoughts. Mixing The Stone Roses' "_I Am The Resurrection_" with Bonde Do Rolàª's "_Solta o Frango_", New Order's "_Crystal_" with Depeche Mode's "_It's No Good_", Slayer and Atari Teenage Riot's "_No Remorse (I Wanna Die)_" with Popsicle's "_Not Forever_". Maybe not the last one. Maybe.

In any case, if you don't turn up for the event you might peek a glance of it live right [here](http://qik.com/pivic), as I aim to momentarily shoot a little live footage during the course of the evening. Feel very free to drop by! As I've pimped out everywhere and to everyone, details are found [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=2372).

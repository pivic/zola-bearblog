I thought I'd given in when it came to Pete Doherty, alarming man and somewhat known to the irate, general public as member of The Libertines and Babyshambles, but alas, no. [He's (perhaps inadvertently) fed a penguin a joint](http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=230023). A joint. At first I laughed, then felt sorry for said penguin (if the matter really has taken place) and then wondered when new music will arrive from the man, which really is all I care about. Strewth.

Speaking of which, [this article](http://suicidegirls.com/news/culture/20493) shows the American health-care system in a real shambles. The difference between the rich and the poor take on very tangible levels when displayed like this. [Noam Chomsky](http://chomsky.info) writes well about that in "[Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Dominance](http://www.amazon.com/Hegemony-Survival-Americas-Dominance-American/dp/0805074007)".

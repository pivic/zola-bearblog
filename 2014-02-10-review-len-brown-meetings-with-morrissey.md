[![Meetings with Morrissey](http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1328707907m/6589354.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6589354)[Meetings with Morrissey](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6589354) by [Len Brown](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/580222)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/838026843)  
  
This book is, in my limited mind, the best partner to Morrissey's "_Autobiography_". I have read Johnny Rogan's "_Morrissey & Marr: The Severed Alliance_" but it is nowhere near its main subject as this book is.

Brown is, in my mind, a brilliant researcher whose careful writing and restrained fandom - for make no mistake, he is an ardent Morrissey fan - makes this book essential for everybody who are into Moz.

Where Morrissey's "Autobiography" delves far deeper into Morrissey's internal workings where The Smiths and his solo work is concerned (not to mention everything else that Moz writes of), Brown's second person view is required and at times questions Morrissey and his thoughts.

This book is from the start of The Smiths and ends with Morrissey's "Ringleader Of The Tormentors", and as such, it covers a lot of areas, and also manages to focus on a few subjects, e.g. the human sexuality, vegetarianism, Oscar Wilde and female artists from the 1950s.

Essential to fans, and highly recommendable to anybody who wants to read a very human account of a very accounted human; Morrissey remains the funniest star in music, ever.

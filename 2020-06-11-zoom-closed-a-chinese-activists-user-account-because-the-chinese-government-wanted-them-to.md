> The U.S. video-conferencing company Zoom closed the account of a group of prominent U.S.-based Chinese activists after they held a Zoom event commemorating the [31st anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen](https://www.axios.com/china-tiananmen-square-anniversary-photos-ba82a6be-cf26-434f-9ac6-8200fb122414.html) Square Massacre

So, China cracks down on citizens who discuss the [Tiananmen Square Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests). Everybody knows China is extremely insane when it comes to monitoring their citizens. For example:

> Every citizen in China, which now has numbers swelling to well over 1.3 billion, would be given a score that, as a matter of public record, is available for all to see. This citizen score comes from monitoring an individual’s social behavior — from their spending habits and how regularly they pay bills, to their social interactions — and it’ll become the basis of that person’s trustworthiness, which would also be publicly ranked.

> This actually sounds worse than an Orwellian nightmare.

So, China is a raging dictatorship. Nothing new about it. It's horrendous and must be contested at all times, but nothing new.

Zoom, however, is a USA-based company that only exists to accumulate more money for their shareholders. That's their raison d'être.

Any company that exists should be concerned with morals and build a transparent ethical code that they adhere to. [As I have written numerous times before](https://niklasblog.com/?s=zoom), Zoom have behaved more than nefariously; they have, on both technical and business levels, acted shadily, to put it mildly. Read up on what they've done.

Therefore, it should come as a surprise to nobody, that they've now closed a Zoom user account because China asked them to.

This is an excerpt of how Zoom comments on this:

> We aim to limit the actions we take to those necessary to comply with local law and continuously review and improve our process on these matters.
>

As [The Citizen Lab correctly predicted April 4, 2020](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/04/move-fast-roll-your-own-crypto-a-quick-look-at-the-confidentiality-of-zoom-meetings/), Zoom could very well just bow down to demands from the Chinese government. This is why:

> Zoom, a Silicon Valley-based company, appears to own three companies in China through which at least 700 employees are paid to develop Zoom’s software. This arrangement is ostensibly an effort at _labor arbitrage_: Zoom can avoid paying US wages while selling to US customers, thus increasing their profit margin. However, this arrangement may make Zoom responsive to pressure from Chinese authorities.

**Note**: Zoom have not responded to queries of why they have deleted user accounts:

> **Details:** Zhou Fengsuo, founder of the U.S. nonprofit Humanitarian China and former student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen protests, organized the May 31 event held through a paid Zoom account associated with Humanitarian China.
> 
> - About 250 people attended the event. Speakers included mothers of students killed during the 1989 crackdown, organizers of Hong Kong's Tiananmen candlelight vigil, and others.
> - On June 7th, the Zoom account displayed a message that it had been shut down, in a screenshot viewed by Axios. Zhou has not been able to access the account since then, and Zoom has not responded to his emails, he told Axios.
> - A second Zoom account belonging to a pro-democracy activist, Lee Cheuk Yan, a former Hong Kong politician and pro-democracy activist, was also closed in late May. Lee has also received no response from Zoom.

To Zoom: just be decent human beings; you are currently not. This is horrendous.

I would never, ever use Zoom willingly. Just use [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/).

Also, if you've missed this:

In other words: Zoom only provide 'encryption' to paying users. I use hyphens because:

- Zoom have [lied about adhering to industry standards when they claimed to use end-to-end encryption](https://niklasblog.com/?p=24499), which means they might lie about all of this
- Zoom's code is completely closed, which means we cannot validate their encryption claims

> Yaqiu Wang, China researcher for Human Rights Watch said: “Laws in China are often abusive and don’t comply with international human rights standards. Yet tech companies have a responsibility to respect human rights.”
> 
> “Tech companies should stand together to resist Beijing’s censorship demands and uphold the right to freedom of expression. Otherwise, the grovelling will never end,” she said.

[![Moonage Daydream: The Life and Times of Ziggy Stardust](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1181078688m/1110065.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110065.Moonage_Daydream)[Moonage Daydream: The Life and Times of Ziggy Stardust](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110065.Moonage_Daydream) by [David Bowie](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10360.David_Bowie)  
My rating: [5 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/135846237)  
  
In the process of Mick Rock's start to become a rock photographer we get to see his visual documentation as he follows David Bowie around, annotated by Bowie himself.  
  
This is almost a photographic record of Bowie's kick-off into stardom as he is about to release "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars". The book follows his climb from local star into America and ends just as he's taking the next step, slightly during and after "Pin-ups", the fated cover album.  
  
During the entire book one cannot slip the feeling of Bowie being an icon in so many ways, staying humble through his own words, debunking myths (once as "tosh") and glorifying the people who helped him to garb, make-up and generally help him in a variety of ways, not least Mick Ronson and Mick Rock. The Micks.  
  
All in all, a very, very well-edited tome of one of the biggest - if not The biggest - pop-star these modern days have seen.

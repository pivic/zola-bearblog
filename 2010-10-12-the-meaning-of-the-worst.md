"This is the worst case I've ever come across."

![Dr. Phil](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-05-29-drphil.jpg)"He is without a doubt the worst serial killer ever."

"For what he did, he deserves to die."

I just watched "_[Dr. Phil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr.%20Phil%20%28TV%20series%29)_" during an episode that concentrates on one of the survivors who met up with [Rodney Alcala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Alcala), and sure, I deserve what I get for watching that show, but when I see people who desperately want and seemingly need to say somebody is _the worst_ serial killer I wonder...why?

What constitutes "the worst"? The number of people who are affected by the serial killer? The way in which the serial killer affected them? How he taunted the survivors and/or the victims' families? How...

I think trying to "reason" like that is just losing the plot. It reminds me of the times when people accuse serial killers of being "monsters", in order to try and say a human being couldn't do what they did.

Well, tell you what: if "the worst" serial killer "monster" is deemed according to what Dr. Phil and his cohorts seemingly would like to hunt with pitchforks and torches, take a look at your own government. And most governments across the globe.

And yes, I think the death penalty is utterly wrong. Dr. Phil...no more, please.

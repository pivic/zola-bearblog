It's not albums released in 2015, it's albums I've _listened to_ in 2015. And really, it's not just albums - it's live bootlegs, singles, EPs - anything that's basically released as _one work_. I hope some good comes out of this list, because I've seen some very strange misses in best-of-2015 lists, e.g. **[Torres](https://niklasblog.com/?p=17291)**' album, which is a container for remarkably good songwriting and performance, also **[Barbara Morgenstern](http://www.barbaramorgenstern.de/doppelstern)**'s new album, "_Doppelstern_", called a "collaboration project" by herself, which is astonishingly good - it's my favourite of hers, which says a lot. Also, **[Du Blonde](https://niklasblog.com/?p=17308)** has single-handedly wrapped up glam rock without being the least dull.

**Sleaford Mods** keep being current and probably the best duo in Great Britain since they came up, **The Charlatans** came back from death and California with their best album yet. Speaking of artists getting stronger, let's mention **Alva Noto**, **Nils Frahm** and **[The Libertines](https://niklasblog.com/?p=17515)**. Ah, _The Libertines_...talk about coming back from death, poetically speaking, here.

To sum up, either it's been a year where I've not liked electronic as much as non-electronic music, but the electronics are at the bottom where the twanged stuff is generally at the top.

Still, as far as 2016 goes, **David Bowie** has set a target and standard of sorts by releasing an album that's filled with electro-acoustic jazzy non-conforming stuff, and it's still poppier and definitely more alive and better than most of what I heard in 2015. So here's to the future, and here's the past:

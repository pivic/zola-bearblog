I'd like to see "[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362270)" by [Wes Anderson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027572), the director of "[The Royal Tenenbaums](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=157)". The soundtrack to the new film is really good, and the special songs are actually the ones by Mark Mothersbaugh (formerly the front of Devo) and the David Bowie-covers by Seu Jorge, who plays the guitar, singing them in Portugese. Sadly [his site](http://www.seujorge.com) is currently only available in Portugese, but will that stop us from accessing it? Go on. We're all international.

I'm also interested in one from director Joon-ho Bong \[sic\], called "[Memories of Murder](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353969)". Clearly I haven't been fed enough detective stories since getting the Sherlock Holmes set.

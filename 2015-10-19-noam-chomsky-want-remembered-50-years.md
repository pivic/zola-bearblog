> **Q**: Fifty years from now, how do you hope people will remember you?
> 
> **A**: It’s really not something I care about very much. I don’t like things to be personalized. I mean there are ideas that I hope people will regard as significant, develop, incorporate into their own thinking, and pursue further. That’s what matters. Whether a name is associated with it or not is insignificant. … I couldn’t care less.

The above is from a post where Noam Chomsky is answering questions from [Parlio.com](http://parlio.com/qa/noam-chomsky) on October 4, 2015.

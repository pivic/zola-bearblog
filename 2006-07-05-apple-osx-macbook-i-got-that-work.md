![Apple, c'est le bon manko.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ab/Apple-logo.png)The Apple [MacBooks](http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html) have been dissed a lot: [orange discolorations](https://niklasblog.com/?p=965) \[which [Apple may be taking care of](http://blog.wired.com/cultofmac/index.blog?entry_id=1511576)\], they're [really hot](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303848) (with some accessories even [burning](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/laptops/magsafe-burning-not-isolated-183185.php)), [some moo](http://moobook.com/?p=4) and [a few geeks are leaving Mac/OSX for Ubuntu](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/05/30/bye-apple), one of them even writing on [how he went about it](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/26/essentials-2006).

During this time, Apple have been attacked for using [sweat-shops to get iPods made](http://feeds.wired.com/CultOfMac?m=141) and are frequently (and rightfully so) assailed for their silence, both for being quiet on the whole, and for [not really revealing any coming products](http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2006/6/26/4446) (until people have bought theirs just before the new ish is released, and cannot exchange it for the new). At times, it seems [only a storm of voices](http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?RSS&NewsID=15119) can affect them; some even create [an entire blog dedicated to bashing Apple](http://appledash.wordpress.com), and I'm not saying that's wrong.

On the other hand, the MacBooks have been [nearly universally acclaimed](http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/macbook.ars), you can now run Windows off the blasted thing, it's extremely GTD\-oriented, devices you plug in don't need drivers, there are almost no virii for OSX, it starts up really fast...there's [a plethora](http://www.apple.com/getamac) of reasons to get one, if you can afford it.

There are [freeware alternatives](http://www.sebpayne.com/2006/06/27/one-thing-apple-did-right) to some of the programs Apple offer, for other operating systems, although they're mostly not made or supported by professionals - which can actually be a _pro_ rather than a _con_ when you consider how silent Apple is as a company, whereas open communities consisting of open source-fanatics tend to be quite quick in replying when one is in need of aid.

I have bought a MacBook, and I'll tell you why; the following list is not in any kind of order.

1\. Power. The dual-core Intel-processor runs fast, yet I strongly recommend anybody who thinks of purchasing a MacBook to go for 2GB's of RAM, instead of settling down with the 512MB that are included; the prices are quite low, anyway. And this is modern stuff, just check [the spec's](http://www.apple.com/macbook/specs.html). A built-in webcam, Gigabit Ethernet, DVD-burner, glossy screen and magnetic screen-lock are only parts of the solution.

2\. Programs included are well thought-through. [Spotlight](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight), which enables you to search your hard-disk for anything in no-time (unlike the very dysfunctional indexing-engine currently [built into Windows Vista](http://blogs.msdn.com/cheller/archive/2006/06/21/642220.aspx)) [Exposé](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose) and a variety of different applications, e.g. [iLife](http://www.apple.com/ilife), that covers my needs for importing, organising, sorting and exporting pictures (even directly to flickr after I installed a free plugin), burning DVD's that I have mucked about with myself, making a little music...it's good. Check [these tutorials](http://www.apple.com/ilife/tutorials) from Apple. And that's just a little bit. Look into Exposé, the widgets, the stuff that's years before Windows Vista or any other operating system I've found, and that's most definitely including Ubuntu, which I count as being the most noteworthy Linux-platform, and its [XGL graphics](http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=112411).

3\. Virtualisation. [Microsoft are using MacBooks](http://feeds.macuser.com/macuser?m=857) (Pro, though) to show Windows Vista, so why shouldn't I be doing the same? _And_ I can run [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com), which covers all my needs, and thanks to [Boot Camp](http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp), I can even run those OS's natively. Fancy, huh? _A-hu-hu-huh,_ too.

4\. The operating-system looks fantastic, feels fresh and runs steadily. Yeah, [it's beautiful](http://www.phillryu.com/2006/07/03/the-top-ten-most-beautiful-os-x-apps), which Microsoft are best at showing as they're constantly ripping OSX into Windows Vista. Sure, I can run around Windows because I have used it for more than a decade, but it still has a lot of stuff to learn from Apple - which, yet again, is why Microsoft are ripping OSX for a lot of features that are coming in Windows Vista.

5\. Security and safety. [It's safe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5150508.stm). It's built on [UNIX](http://www.unix.org/what_is_unix.html), old as streets and wise as Gods; I'm not saying OSX or UNIX is unpenetrable (it's built by humans, cry-out-loud-time) but it's the nearest we are at the moment according to a lot of people - and [Sophos, as linked](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5150508.stm).

All in all, I've been using my MacBook for little more than a week. I'm very satisfied. In fact, I've never been this satisfied with a laptop computer, but I'm not abandoning Windows, oh no. I like living in different worlds, savouring the flavours of all and getting a scent of what's good from "abroad", no matter where that is from. The Mac offers me the best choices where [productivity](http://www.macuser.com/ihnatko/ihnatko_underused_and_unapprec.php), integration and play are involved - for me, that is. I can't speak for any other person in this matter. Of course, there are downsides. I hate iTunes, I firmly dislike QuickTime, but there are so many upsides that it makes Windows look like the iron age. Thanks to programs like [Delicious Library](http://www.delicious-monster.com), [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com), [VirtueDesktops](http://virtuedesktops.info), [NeoOffice](http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php), [iStumbler](http://www.istumbler.net) and among loads of [beautiful](http://www.phillryu.com/2006/07/03/the-top-ten-most-beautiful-os-x-apps) and [necessary](http://paulstamatiou.com/2005/12/19/10-apps-every-new-mac-user-should-download) apps, among the [cool](http://feeds.macuser.com/macuser?m=855) little features.

**edit**: I've started to hate my MacBook for shutting down spontaneously and for having a hard time to boot. Check [this post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1027) for more info.

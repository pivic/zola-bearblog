A fresh study by [The Children's Play Council](http://www.ncb.org.uk/cpc) shows that British fathers do not spend enough time playing with their children. The report can be found [here](http://www.culture.gov.uk/global/publications/archive_2004/children_play_review_report.htm).

Among many varied subjects across the play spectrum, the report brings up the subject of British fathers' (which I suspect not only to be a British problem) inability to lose against their children, while in play. According to the report, as reported on in [DN](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=148&a=297270&previousRenderType=8) \[Swedish\], some fathers believe they will lose respect from the children, if they lose against them. On the contrary, if the children continually lose, they will feel demoralised and won't have fun at all.

Also noteworthy is that fathers feel they're playing with their children, just by being in the play-ground with them, i.e. not actually participating in their games. The children do generally not count this as participation. They want their dads to do stuff with them, for it to count as play.

I hope I'll become a great dad when my time comes. Oh sweet mother, I really hope I will.

Oh yes, I've discovered "_[Laguna Beach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguna_Beach:_The_Real_Orange_County)_", which is life after before "_[The Hills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Hills)_".

I'm impressed by the quality of the show, and reminded of what squabbles and trifles that surrounded high-school when I was there. Also, it's bisarre to note that [Kristin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin%20Cavallari) mentally hasn't aged at all. [Lo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo%20Bosworth) is the real magic. She's like a weird pixie, who sometimes may look confused but often in conversation suddenly erupts through a zen-like sentence, e.g. "Eat your Pink Berry and enjoy life!"

The second season is (so far, I haven't watched it all) weaker than the first, notably because Lo and Lauren aren't much in it, but I'm hoping for more lively - as opposed to _only_ drama - stuff to happen. I quote Will Sheff:

> And this film we once saw was reviled for it's flaws But it's flaws were what made us have fun

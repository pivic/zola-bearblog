As this year's edition of [the Eurovision Song Contest](http://www.esctoday.com) is about to kick off, Sweden is on the way to crown its finalist. The first of four weekly, live contests kicked off this past Saturday, and my fave - Amy Diamond with "_Thank You_"- won her way into the final. But there's another favourite, too.

As Swedish stately TV decided it was time to let a comedian entertain everybody in-between songs, I expected the whole thing to be pathetic, especially as [Kristian Luuk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristian_Luuk) hosted the show, parading his wonderful sense of humor with professionalism; I just didn't think another comedian would stand a chance. But hey, in stepped a guy named [Björn Gustafsson](http://www.bjorngustafsson.se) and stole the show. Sadly, his brilliant monologue beneath is in Swedish, but the first half of the video shows him dancing to Haddaway's "_What Is Love?_" without doing it like...[Germany's ESC-representatives](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivLUDKospzc) (who always seem to make complete asses of themselves without the slightest tinge of irony). Here's Björn:

Even though her voice is too fragile and uninteresting to last for an entire album, mostly because of her utter lack of phrasing and timbre, here's a video of my fave, Amy Diamond, doing her "_Thank You_":

The most pathetic entry was, of course, Christer Sjögren's "_I Love Europe_", as can be tragically witnessed [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naAq8aZ1Js); runner-ups for that title being Wille Crafoord (for writing the most tepid lyrics for one of the most vapid songs) and E-Type for plainly being himself.

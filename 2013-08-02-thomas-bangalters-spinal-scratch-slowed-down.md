I've always loved this song. I first heard it as part of a compilation issued by Swedish Bibel magazine, and now it's yours.

**[Thomas Bangalter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bangalter)** has made some really strong music as 50% of Daft Punk, but his solo stuff deserve credit. The most interesting thing about this track, "_Spinal Scratch_", is that this version is (un)intentionally slowed-down by the people who put the compilation out. I listened to it a massive amount before hearing it at the "official speed"; that version is here:

So please enjoy an alternative version that I think is a vast improvement on the original, which was issued in 1996 on Bangalter's [Roulé label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roul%C3%A9):

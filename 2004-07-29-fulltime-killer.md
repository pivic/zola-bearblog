I recently saw "[Fulltime Killer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286635/combined)", a total action film from Hong Kong.

It contains nice footage and quite good music, for being an Asian film. Of course this is prejudiced of me, yet I have still to see an Asian film with good music. Of course, it's hard to find this in Hollywood films as well, but the Asian ones are filled with stuffs that suddenly...make [Andrew Lloyd-Webber](http://www.reallyuseful.com) palatable.

About the film: I saw it with Frederic, who early on said it reminded him a little of "[Desperado](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112851/combined)" (or possibly "[El Mariachi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104815/combined)"); right after having said that, the more interesting male lead character, Lok, tells us his situation reminds him of "Desperado". Wah! He goes on making drab film references, and there's the usual bit of stealing Kubrick's idea of using classical music during ultra-violent phases of the film. Of course, that's not entirely Kubrick's idea, you say, but what you don't know, until now, is that Beethoven's ninth is clearly hearable during some slow-motion plays of a guy in an American president mask (which isn't just a reference to "[Point Break](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102685/combined)" - this film is also referred to in conversation during the film) who kills everybody in sight.

Another drab action film with some spots of light shone at bisarre moments. Another thing: just when we thought the film would end, it goes on. And that happens again and again, until some weird sort of "Apocalypse Now"-writer's period is included, and it goes on a bit more, and just when you think you can't take any more, you realise the film's ended. Wow. Credit rolls, usual horrid Asian film music starts. What a kicker!

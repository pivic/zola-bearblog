[Dagens lapp/Note of the day](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/2306637435/)  

Here's a little poetry to brighten up your day.

I found this note at an institution where I worked today. My translation from Swedish:

_I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE DARK . BUT I_ AM _AFRAID OF LONELINESS. THE DARK DOES NOT SCARE ME WHEN I AM ALONE, BUT,,,,LONELINESS SCARES ME EVEN IN THE DAYLIGHT._

Three years ago I picked up "[Blue Spring](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309291)", which was great because of two reasons:

1\. The film is fantastic, surreal and about youths in school where no rules apply. See it. 2. I discovered [Thee Michelle Gun Elephant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thee_Michelle_Gun_Elephant), whose album "[Rodeo Tandem Beat Specter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodeo_Tandem_Beat_Specter)" is prominently featured in the film.

Here's the intro from said movie, which not only shows the great start of the film ((With stunning cinematography, sound and colours.)) but runs TMGE's brilliant song "The Redhead Kelly" (also known as "No akage Kelly"). Enjoy.

A problem anybody ((Hopefully, which means you're actually trying to present your digits in the optimal fashion.)) faces when trying to present or even create a chart is picking the correct type. They range from the simpler - bar, column and pie charts - to the more complex - bubble, circular and scatter charts.

Thus, I was happy to see [this page](http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/2006/09/choosing_a_good.html), where Andrew Abela had created a flowchart designed to help you decide which type of chart to opt for. Sweet.

Let the below embedded document serve as a zoomable preview, and go [here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/10966493/Choosing-a-Good-Chart-09) if you wish to get the bigger picture or download it.

Last Thursday I went on a car-ride with two colleagues. We travelled from the posh side of Stockholm city - i.e. à–stermalm - to the less-posh-but-still-ridiculously-expensive bit called Södermalm.

Here's a glimpse of how Stockholm can look on a sunny day. Old houses, cars, vespas, people in all shapes and forms and even a tunnel-ride is promised herein, all to the tones of Mogwai, Jorge Ben Jor and Beck. Enjoy!

As I walked out of a subway station this morning I was handed something I though were a packet of [sparklers](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Sparkler.JPG). "Cool!" I thought, but I wasn't prepared for a christian candle inside a little box!

I wish it were a sparkler.

By the way, today it's 6 years, 8 months and 9 days since I formally resigned from christianity.

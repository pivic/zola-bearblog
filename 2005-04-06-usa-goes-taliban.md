Today [Andreas](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreasflodin) e-mailed a very interesting article to me, titelled "[Introducing The Constitution Restoration Act: Say Hello To Taliban America And Goodbye To Godless Judges, Courts And Law](http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=104&ItemID=7569)", which is written by W. David Kubiak. Here's the synopsis:

> Tired of waiting for the Second Coming to enforce Christ's rule on Earth? Fortunately, so is your Congress and they know how to "bring it on."
> 
> Just when you thought the corporatist/Christian Coalition had milked the 9/11 "surprise" for all it was worth in powers, profits and votes, we regret to report that you may have to think again. Just in case you've briefly fallen behind on your rightwing mailing lists, you might have missed the March 3rd filing of Senate bill S. 520 and House version is H.R. 1070, AKA the "Constitution Restoration Act" (CRA).
> 
> In the worshipful words of the Conservative Caucus, this historic legislation will "RESTORE OUR CONSTITUTION!", mainly by barring ANY federal court or judge from ever again reviewing "any matter to the extent that relief is sought against an entity of Federal, State, or local government, or against an officer or agent of Federal, State, or local government (whether or not acting in official or personal capacity), concerning that entity's, officer's, or agent's acknowledgment of God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or government." \[Emphasis demanded - see full text [here](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.520:).\]
> 
> In other words, the bill ensures that God's divine word (and our infallible leaders' interpretation thereof) will hereafter trump all our pathetic democratic notions about freedom, law and rights -- and our courts can't say a thing. This, of course, will take "In God We Trust" to an entirely new level, because soon He (and His personally anointed political elite) will be all the legal recourse we have left.
> 
> This is not a joke, a test, or a fit of libertarian paranoia. The CRA already has 28 sponsors in the House and Senate, and a March 20 call to lead sponsor Sen. Richard Shelby's office assures us that "we have the votes for passage."

What a god-damned (pun intended) hell on earth this is. The evangelical, conservative christians of the USA must be laughing their heads off this very minute. How the hell did they ever get this mental fuck-fest going? The problem I see, is one: the televangelists, the SuperHoly people, everybody who claim they're a channel of God's voice, are going to say they're right by law to do what they do. Imagine the people bombing abortion clinics. Do you think they'll get a harder or easier time in court? "Well, God says abortions are bad, so sorry, court." And that's just on a very small plane. Imagine...the USA invading other countries while their mad presidente claims God's on their side? Oh sorry, that's already happened. But imagine nuclear holocausts happening because people like Rush "[illegal immigrants are invasive species](http://mediamatters.org/items/200504040001)" Limbaugh, Dubya, Pat Buchanan, Ann Coulter, Pat Robertson and the rest of their pack pushes the buttons required? Choo-choo, the total-and-utter-annihilation-train is on its way, next stop: you.

Click [here](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009JYAG2/103-4131982-7739061) to go to a page on Amazon, where you can download the song "Black Dialogue" by [The Perceptionists](http://www.definitivejux.net/jukies/the_perceptionists). I've been nagging about these guys [before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=472), but do it! Theirs is the best hip-hop album of 2005, this far, and is also titelled "Black Dialogue". Besides, visit [this page](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0009JYAEO/ref=j_disp_dwnld_2/103-4131982-7739061?v=glance&s=music&st=digital-music), where you'll find "Let's Move", a great track off the album.

MP3.com offers [this page](http://music.download.com/theperceptionists/3600-8543_32-100480132.html), where you can download their "Memorial Day", one of the best songs of their latest album.

That's three free tracks, people! Don't miss them.

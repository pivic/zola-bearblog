![Morrissey - Years Of Refusal](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-05-yearsofrefusal.jpg)

So, the cover art has been blown. The man's standing straight, lungs filled with air, sporting a Fred Perry shirt against a Photoshopped blueish grey backdrop, setting the scene for a 60s-ish typeface to show the man holding a baby in what may be his most symbolic cover art yet. This is light-years from what I thought were possible, had you asked me circa "Vauxhall And I".

Many interpretations - some more vile (even touching pedophilia) than others (mentioning a "W" or an "M" on the child's forehead and what that may imply) - are [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2008/dec/04/morrissey-years-of-refusal) and what I deem to be his worst cover art ever is [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1811).

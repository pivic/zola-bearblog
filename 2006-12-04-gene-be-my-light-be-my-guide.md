![Gene](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-12-04-gene.jpg)English [Gene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_%28band%29) had their heyday during the 90's, being known for a slew of tracks such as "Olympian", "London, Can You Wait?", "Haunted By You" and "Sleep Well Tonight". They split up at the end of 2004, amicable and from [good reasoning](http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20041117_gene.shtml).

Despite being compared with [The Smiths](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:3x61mpm39f8o) - despite more rocky tracks with infinitely simpler guitar-arrangements (no diss though) - they stood their own with good melodies, fine guitar-driven tracks and Martin Rossiter's quite singular voice and lyrics. They also cared about their b-sides and fans.

The best comparison that could be made is that [Gene's second album](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:lz0xlfaehcqi) also is a good collection of b-sides, alternative versions and live cuts, just like "[Hatful Of Hollow](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:8n0xlf3egcqt)".

Still, their first album, "[Olympian](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:rjyvadsky8w3)", is the money-shot for me, bringing great tracks such as "Sleep Well Tonight" - coupled with [this great English everyday video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdJhMDRCQVM) for that song.

I recommend their greatest hits-album, "[As Good As It Gets: The Best Of Gene](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wduw6jp271q0)", and here's "Be My Light, Be My Guide", a great track that represents Gene well.

As usual, the track will be deleted in a week.

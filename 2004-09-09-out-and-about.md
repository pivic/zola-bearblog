First though, I've gotta sing praise for the NEC DVD-burner. It was very easy to flash (not making quarrels about it, unlike my old bulk \[OEM means part of a full PC package or external USB/FireWire variant, bulk here means a single burner purchased without any cables or extra mumbo\] Sony burner - mind you, Sony didn't make firmware updates for their bulk burners. Anyway, it works like a bag of charms.

Yesterday my hearing started to work out. Last week I accidentally plugged in my headphones into my POD_xt_ after having lined it out to the amp, which resulted in me striking a power chord and hearing the blast at maximum volume. Mikaela, who was appx. two yards from me at the time, thought I was fretting at a medium volume on the amp. On the amp! I didn't hear a ringing, but my hearing has been impaired for the past week. As I wrote, yesterday my left ear, which I was having the most problems with, started popping, as when you yawn and your ears pop, resulting in a "clearing of noise". That happened a lot yesterday, and now it seems a lot better. I hope it's all working out. At least I'm not so sensitive to treble as I was the days right after it happened.

Anyzay, Zak and I met at SÃ¶derhof and drank while people watched the soccer game between Sweden and Croatia. Apparently, a referee made an error which could have resulted in Sweden being defeated, but what the hell, I was only happy watching the sports buffoons taking things too seriously. It's a game! My gawd. This didn't stop them from standing up like drunk apes, hollering. It was fun, like going to the zoo. I'm not saying this because I didn't drink, hell, I'm an ape when I'm drunk like most, but sports fanaticism can really be fun when watching the attendees.

By drinking I mean Zak drank beer, and I drank some rotten version of orange juice. The bartender was very nice though, and hence I had three while Zak downed his beers and I walked out of the whole thing unscathed and feeling great, while Zakkie bwoi staggered homewards, drunk and feeling like the #1 producer that he is!

When I stepped on the train home I entered the first cart as usual, and just after leaving the station the door to the driver opened, and lo and behold - Daniel, a mate! I stepped into the driver's cabin and was amazed by how cool that felt. Daniel told me about a semi-recent suicide he'd encountered, driving a train when suddenly a man jumped out and ended his life on his wind-shield. What a shock. At least, Daniel was immediately relieved and went to see a psychologist the day after, on the company's expense, of course. Can't be much use otherwise. Daniel told me he still gets flash-backs when he sees people, often drunks, careening toward the platform edge, no wonder. Such a selfish way to commit suicide!

Came home, showered, threw all my very ill-scenting clobber into a hamper and went to bed, knackered. Woke up in an empty bed as Mikaela had slept at her parents' place; she tried out Sebastian's [tempur mattress](http://www.spineuniverse.com/displayarticle.php/article2058.html) as we're thinking of getting a big one ourselves. It costs a bunch of money, but would probably help infinitely with our semi-bad backs.

Now I'm just drinking Lipton's Earl Grey, trying to think it's Yogi tea. No head-ache. No hang-over. Lurvly.

I've written [this post](http://juvenal.wordpress.com/2005/12/16/noam-chomsky-on-propaganda) at Juvenal, where you'll find a lovely quote from [Noam Chomsky](http://www.chomsky.info) on propaganda, on how to handle it (i.e. use common sense) and a snippet on the importance of questioning matters.

As Dagens Nyheter, the biggest daily newspaper in Sweden, has slipped up on their distribution today, they're offering everybody who can read this the chance to download the entire paper (or bits of it) as PDF's. You can find them [here](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1348&previousRenderType=3). Edit: the PDF's have been removed since that day.

This morning at work, tired as hell, I walked towards the toilets. I heard a scream from their direction. A man whom I've never met before scuttled towards me, pants at his ankles.

"Don't go near the toilets! Don't!"

He went past me. I asked him if I could help. I saw a couple of blobs of blood on the floor from where he'd come.

"No thanks, but don't go near the toilets, _please_!"

I went the other way and when I later returned, everything was back to normal - except for my mind.

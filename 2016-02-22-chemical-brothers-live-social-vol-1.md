Part of what I loved about the 1990s is the fact that The Chemical Brothers not only brought a new era of electronic dance music, but a seldom-seen sensibility towards great old-school hip-hop and funk, which reverberates throughout most of what they've done, from being named The Dust Brothers until today. Here's evidence of that, [this post](https://medium.com/@pivic/primal-scream-jailbird-dust-brothers-remix-52232590e2d7#.2jiznecfv) I made on The Dust Brothers' remix of Primal Scream's "_Jailbird_", which contains a brilliant [Spoonie Gee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonie_Gee) sample.

In 1996, as part of the regular gamut of DJs who collated to play at Heavenly Recordings' parties titled [The Heavenly Sunday Social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavenly_Recordings#The_Social), and this is a recording from such a night, where The Chemical Brothers play it out. Eclectic shit, but more for dancing and love than trying to show off.

OK, below's the mix album in its entirety, but go [buy it](https://www.discogs.com/Chemical-Brothers-Live-At-The-Social-Volume-1/release/3314)! It's so worth it.

You've got [Cash Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Cash_Money) & Marvelous great "_Mighty Hard Rocker_" alongside Davy DMX's "_The DMX Will Rock_" and Selectah's "_Wede Man (Hoody Mix)_" which is so grand, an after-hours closer of sorts for when you're winding down, wound-down from dancing and ready to go home even though you don't want to. Lionrock's "_Packet Of Peace_" is well-mixed by the Chemicals to start with but incorporated here, it's a bass-intense wind-up. And then you've got [Eric B. & Rakim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_B._%26_Rakim)'s ever-mighty and a #1 hip-hop track "_Juice (Know The Ledge) (Main Mix)_" which is mixed to be better than the original...there's just too much goodness here.

Then, there's always this...

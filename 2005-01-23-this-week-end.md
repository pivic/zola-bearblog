![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-01-23-dad.gif)First, I've gotta show you some pictures of which most are taken today, when my parents and my grandmother dropped by to give me some presents. How nice of them! Anyway, check the pictures [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-01-23). The grainy pictures, of food and the guys in the beginning, are from Thursday when I went on a mini-conference with my work-mates. [Here's a film](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-01-23/video_00011.mp4) \[MP4, 400KB\] from the lunch at that conference, by the way. The pictures from today are great. My mother's so photogenique, I wonder from where I've inherited that trait, hee hee. My dad's deerlight face isn't bad either!

[Here's a film](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-01-23/video_00009.mp4) \[MP4, 600KB\] from the auction that Mikaela and I visited with Staffan and Patrik last week. [Here's a film](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-01-23/video_00010.mp4) \[MP4, 700KB\] from where we went after that to have a coffee. Note Patrik with his new toy, the video camcorder. Be sure to note his reaction when he finds he's not the only helmer around. Speaking of that, note [this very weird guy](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-01-23/image_00001.jpg) from when Zak and I were on our way to Grill last week-end. He sat opposite to us and hid his face the entire time, sniggering, saying "You cannot see me...but I can see you!". The one-man army!

On Friday Mikaela and I went to Frederic to cook some food and just hang around. That is, Mikaela and Frederic cooked and I watched. Anyway, the lamb they had bought from Vivo Hornstull was rotten! ROTTEN. It had been purchased the day before, so either they're incompetent (which normally, according to Frederic, isn't the case) or just neglecting their duties on purpose. Well, they went to the place and got some steaks instead. Tough luck, but the food went really well with some grilled garlic and other wonderful delis. Check out [this little film](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-01-23/video_00012.mp4) \[MP4, 1,3MB\] showing Mikaela and Frederic at work in his kitchen.

Yesterday Mikaela and I went to åsa's birthday party. åsa is a work-mate of Mikaela's, who is also the owner of Frasse, the little British shorthair-kitty I've posted pictures of on this blog. Anyway we went to the party where Patrik and Staffan were also. Everybody were handed a fortune cookie-shaped bit of paper carrying either a slogan or the name of a house-hold brand. The idea was that people should mingle and seek out the person carrying the paper-scrap that matched one's slogan/brand. I didn't hurry, as the seats were labelled with the brand names and I knew mind. I sat to the left of a lady who (I was later told) hurried to tell me she was part of "the singles club", and was very everywhere-at-once, jumpy. Mikaela was next to some clean-cut guy she seemed to get along fine with. Gah! I sincerely hoped for some good company. Anyway, I found myself neighbour with Magnus, a guy who used to work at the same company as I did, which was nice. I landed myself a future DJ job with the lady to my left side, which seems promising; her daughter's having her defence of a doctoral thesis and on the evening I'll play, if everything turns out alright. I actually feel like playing again, it's been ages! DJ'ing to students, especially those who've studied for ages, certainly appeals to me. It feels like they're letting their hair down a mile to unwind for the first time in years, and I love to play eclectic mixes to that kind of crowd. Magnus told me he'd been to Vardagsrum the day before, where Neneh Cherry and a few of her brothers and sisters (like Eagle-Eye and Kayo) played together as they all seem to have moved back to Stockholm. Staffan sat almost opposite to me which also was nice. People had polite conversations, åsa was congratulated by her mother who sang her a tune and gave her a family jewel of sorts, which was nice. The mom had made all the food at the party, which was a pasta-and-meat-soup. There also was dessert.

After the dinner, there would be games. I hate frikkin' games at parties! Demented. Anyway, this wasn't so hard, as we were to team up with our table-partner and endure a guessing-game based on songs. We were the only ones who figured out which group that became a one-hit wonder with "Eye Of The Tiger" (Survivor) but I'd be damned if we'd know who played the female lead in "An Officer And A Gentleman" (Debra Winger). We didn't win, so a mid-sized bottle of Freixnet went to...the hosts, who won! Hm. [Here's a little film](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-01-23/video_00013.mp4) \[MP4, 850KB\] from where we sat and endured the contest.

After that we gave up on the place, so Mikaela, Patrik, Staffan and I went to Cattelins where we met Frederic and partied. After that we went home and to bed. I woke up this morning with a classic head-ache that went away as soon as I went to sleep again, erhm. All well, my parents and my grandmother showed up to woo me, which was really nice. Grandma gave us some wonderful tulips, and I was given a knife-set and a very weird oil-lamp that burned enough to almost soot our kitchen. We threw it out, but it'll probably need a bit of tweaking.

Tomorrow we're going to [Texas Longhorn](http://texaslonghorn.lunchinfo.com), a restaurant which focuses on ribs, as Alexander, one of Mikaela's brothers, is celebrating his birthday there tomorrow. Lurvly.

New Order's dropped a new single, "[Krafty](http://www.neworderonline.com/News.aspx?NewsID=878)", melodic and it actually remembered me of Monaco, the Peter Hook side-project. Strange, that.

Besides, I just saw the first episode of season four of "[The Surreal Life](http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/the_surreal_life_4/88629/episode.jhtml)" on Rade's behest, and it's GRAND. Vern "Mini-Me" Troyer's piss-drunk as he's eating sushi off the girl who won the first Top Model season, sitting next to Peter Brady, while Da Brat's not saying anything as Markus Schenkenberg's being subtitled as he's a nutty Swede and...Vern's God. He's the man. This is the apex of reality shit shows.

At. Long. Last. The release date for "The 3rd World", the third album by [Immortal Technique](http://www.immortal-technique.com), has just been set as I received the following from Immortal's record company:

> **Artist**: Immortal Technique
> 
> **Album**: The 3rd World
> 
> **Release date**: June 24th
> 
> **Label**: Viper Records
> 
> **Distribution**: Koch Entertainment
> 
> **Features include**: Chino XL, Crooked I, RasKass, Psycho Realm, Diabolic
> 
> **Production includes**: Green Lantern, Southpaw, Buckwild, Scram Jones
> 
> \[...\] Immortal Technique and DJ Green Lantern (DJ for Jay Z & Sirius Satellite) complete their vision of colliding their worlds into one full-length album, The 3rd World. The mix of street Hip Hop with the vivid landscapes of global struggle shows that world politics and music politics are almost one in the same. While still a full-length album, DJ Green Lantern blends and mixes it from start to finish, with about a 1/3 of the production to his name. Expect to hear Immortal Technique's striking lyrics on an even more street influenced production that occasionally fortifies him to show his bi-lingual versatility on the mic.

From now on, I'm counting the days.

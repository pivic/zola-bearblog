[![Skulden är inte min](http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1375678567m/18284296.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18284296-skulden-r-inte-min)[Skulden är inte min](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18284296-skulden-r-inte-min) by [Madeleine Nyvall](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7205599.Madeleine_Nyvall)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/686307358)  
  
Great Swedish anthology that picks up on sexism, feminism, individuality and prejudice, among other subjects. I think the best bit about this anthology is how the writers have picked up the little things that I believe a lot of men (and women, to a lesser extent) need to hear in order to understand how structural and widespread antifeminism is, and how important that is to combat.  
  
Worth every penny.

Note that there's a blog, which is the basis for this book, available [here](http://skulden.wordpress.com). As this book is self-published, get it from [here](http://skulden.wordpress.com/boken); it's circa 70 Swedish Crowns cheaper if you e-mail the guys instead of buying it online.

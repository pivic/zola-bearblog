Hunter S. Thompson's "The Rum Diary" is finally going [to become film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376136). Yes!

[Bruce Robinson](http://www.idler.co.uk/html/interviews/interview12.htm), the man who made one of the top cult films ever, "[Withnail & I](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=119)", is set to direct the film with Johnny Depp playing Hunter again, as he did in "[Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=175)". This is [reported by Variety](http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=upsell_article&articleID=VR1117923091&cs=1).

No date is set for the premiere, but I hope production will start this year.

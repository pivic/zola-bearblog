Blixa pictured yesterday. I think she may be looking forward to Spring (with birds chirping and flying) more than I am.

Dinner made on Saturday! It's a lentil stew on a bed of spinach leaves, topped with a yoghurt dressing with fried red onion. Absolutely brilliant.

This is taken from [the Finland ferry trip](https://niklasblog.com/?p=9863) some time ago. The culprits, left to right, are Conny, Andrey and Magnus.

Dinner at [Tabbouli](http://www.tabbouli.eu) SÃ¶dermalm, a Lebanese meze-joint. My cousin Katarina turned up as part of a conference gig and we joined forces and basically ate the hell out of that place.

The day after Tabbouli, we went to my parents and ate semlor ((I must admit, I'd love to pluralise the word into "semlae" or "semlii" just because I can.)), because it was "[fat tuesday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fettisdagen)", when you - of course - eat loads of [semla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semla).

Dad was so happy because of the hat he was given by the Yugo-relatives!

This might be the weirdest pic of a calm Blixa; her arm, her tongue, her lazy eyes.

The bizarre, the Blixa.

Since I'm not into creating graphics or coding, [Apple Design Awards 2006](http://developer.apple.com/ada) did not hold much for me, yet I hereby list the three most interesting products that actually caught my eye - and won awards:

**1**. [iClip Lite 2](http://inventive.us/iCliplite). It's a "multiple clipboard & scrapbook widget", sporting impressive show-and-tell-features to quickly let you get hold of that something you copied an hour and five Apple-C's ago.

**2**. [WeatherBug Widget](http://weatherbug.com/weather-widgets/mac). Another widget, yet this one gives you the weather. International weather is incorporated, and if you cannot see your weather using a live camera through the widget, it will display a satellite-feed for you, plus a forecast and externalia such as precipitation maps. Free as a (non-captive) bird.

**3**. [PhotoPresenter](http://www.arizona-software.ch/applications/photopresenter/en). This one's not a widget, but a little application that allows you to create slideshows with both photos and videos. The [feature-list](http://www.arizona-software.ch/applications/photopresenter/en/features.php) is impressive, and if you want to get rid of the reminder that nags, you merely pay the makers 8USD.

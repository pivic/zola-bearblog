[Here's info](http://www.neowin.net/comments.php?id=25439&category=main) on Novell settling out of court with Microsoft. MS pays 536000000 US dollars to Novell. That's a lot of money. No, wait. It's an EXTREME amount of money! So, they settle out of court? Tell me, is there any way they wouldn't, if they weren't guilty for bending or breaking some anti-trust laws?

Think about that sum again. Microsoft is the biggest company on this Earth, and has just avoided to have to pay an even larger sum of money, by doshing out that half a billion of US dollars. It's probably enough to buy a country or two. That's sick, like Dubya spending another four years in office.

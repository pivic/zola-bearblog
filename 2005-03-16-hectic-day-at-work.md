I haven't been this busy in a while. All sorts of micro-operations going down around me, and I'm constantly needed for something critical. Bwah. This is a tad techy, and a little ditty on what's happened today.

This morning, I thought I was going to have time to spend on a couple of critical projects. Wrong. A developer had a big problem with time-outs in an SQL database. The only way to solve the problem, as he couldn't reach his home network due to problems with his new router, was to tell all users to exit the affected database (although I had to kick some out using a Novell program), back it up, move it to his computer, perform the needed operation on it and then restore it on the production server. All went well, but took time. At the same time, I was questioned on the whereabouts of a consultant whose boss I recently contacted, to find out more: his resources are drastically needed, and I haven't even reached him once in a couple of weeks. Anyway, his boss is now unreachable.

Then another developer showed up, who was to exhibit a new system to a lot of people. He didn't stir anything up, but as I was installing a new server, his "Do all the current users belong to the correct groups?" made me lose my train of thought, and at the same time, an SQL Server (on a test server) went unreachable, so I had to check that out, and also contact a couple of people by phone. I went to lunch 45 minutes later than I usually do, ate (chicken stew pot, a fresh salad and a little feta-cheese sandwich from Pappa Ray Ray) at work with my nice colleagues, but then had to break that off as I had to proof-read a little documentation, meddle with a MS Office-installation and then also make time to check info on the new Fedora core 4 which is in its first test phase.

Then Kalle showed me a little of [how to configure a Cisco switch](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/6663034). Easy!

Now I've been planning for a move of a test server from one physical location to another one, and I'm going blind constantly checking on how many MS-%'s it's complete. Gharr!

Anyway, a little bit of fun is to be had, so check [this link](http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/lacingmethods.htm) on how to tie your shoe-laces in many a fancy way (courtesy of [Mr Anos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/6510771)) and also [Rade](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/6649479) mentioned he loves the way the [Pimpzilla](http://people.zeelandnet.nl/marco/pimpzilla) theme for [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/start) enables the user to make the virtual diamonds sparkle on mouse-overs, which in turn meant I just had to film a little of the action for you peeps out there. Check it [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-16-bling.gif), in the shape of an animated GIF file.

But to end this day on a droll note: how the fuck fucking fucking hellish fucking way could Dubya's goverment contrive something as evil as nominating Wolfowitz to become head of the world bank? I'd say "hell yeah" if I were a war-monging idiot, but I'm not. Right? Anyway, enough ludicrous and mad stuff for today. Time to go home and worship an advance copy of Beck's "[Guero](http://www.beck.com/diskobox/index.php)", which seems set on turning into a masterpiece.

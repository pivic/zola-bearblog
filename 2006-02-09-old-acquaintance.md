While quickly walking through -10 degrees Celsius (plus trickling, thick snow) on the way to the subway, I jogged over a zebra-crossing when I suddenly recognised a figure in front of me; a tall, bearded, bespectabled, hat-wearing man with a purple scarf twirling all around his trenchcoat - good heaven, it's Kaj!

He recognised me in the same way, and we both smiled and stopped (not in the middle of the road, though) to chat some. I've known him during various times for roughly 19 years. He's always treated me great, more like a peer than a child (at the time), always being informative, thinking and personal. So, who's Kaj, and why have we met intermittently?

The reason is simple: Kaj has been the #1 librarian in my old neighbourhood for as long as I can remember.

I cannot recall the many tips he's given me, the extremely numerous times he's photo-copied many-a-chapter from too-many-a-book for me, the one time he helped me when I almost got locked-in at the library, discussions on Baudelaire and Rimbaud and how he's always been...there, in a very good way. Believe me, there were times I basically lived at the local library, which by the way - much thanks to Kaj - had the most extensive collection of audio-CD's I've ever come across in a public institution,

Therefore, I felt glad when he asked me for my phone-number to get in touch. It's not like we know each-other, but seeing him again, getting the same this-is-an-individual-who-really-listens-and-is-fun-to-hang-around-with-vibe was very cool. I hope he calls soon.

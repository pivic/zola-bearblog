Play or download here. **[Torres](http://torrestorrestorres.com)**' new album, "_Sprinter_", may be the best album of the year; fuck comparisons with PJ Harvey and Scout Niblett, she's just so good; I haven't heard emotions this raw since I discovered Lykke Li's latest album. **[Du Blonde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Jeans_Houghton)**'s debut album is coming, but this is the first single and it ROCKS; do also check out [her prior stuff](https://soundcloud.com/muterecords/beth-jeans-houghton-the-5) as Beth Jeans Houghton. **[Zefur Wolves](https://www.facebook.com/zefurwolves)** sing in both English and Spanish, and it's a rawky album that [Cian Ciarán](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cian_Ciaran) from Super Furry Animals have been into. It's a solid album. **[Annette Peacock](http://www.annettepeacock.com)** made a great album in 1972 called "_[I'm the One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_the_One_%28Annette_Peacock_album%29)_", which is a funky, souly, jazzy trip where she's dragged her voice through a Moog synthesizer; it's strange and great.

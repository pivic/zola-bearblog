This book is a funny, boring, and insightful God-level gaze into the minds of some people who work at a public-relations company in the USA. They use [Slack](https://slack.com) to communicate.

Two examples from the book:

* * *

**Nikki, pradeep, Louis C**

**Nikki** Why do we have these calls? What is he even saying?

**pradeep** I have no idea I tune out whenever this dude talks what’s his role over there again?

**Louis C** He’s their comms director.

**pradeep** if they have a comms director then why did they hire us?

**Louis C** Because he isn’t a very good comms director.

**Nikki** You’re both missing my point. I mean, _what is he actually saying_? It sounds like he’s taking this call from the bottom of a well.

**pradeep** if he’s been stuck in a well for a while, that might explain his grasp of like the entire internet

**Louis C** I believe their offices are located in the greater Tampa area.

**Nikki** Is this what Tampa sounds like?

**pradeep** please tell me this dude didn’t just say “myspace” please tell me I did not just hear him say that

**Louis C** Yes. This is what Tampa sounds like.

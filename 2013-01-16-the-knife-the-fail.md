Today The Knife issued pre-sale tickets for their fans. I'm a fan.

First, their site broke down. Then, they posted another URL to get tickets on Facebook. Chaos ensued: "UNAVAILABLE" was the only text for the quantity of tickets I could get. Alright, sold out. F-iiiing...

Then, I reloaded the page a little later. This text popped up having picked Stockholm and 2 tickets:

> THE QUANTITY YOU HAVE REQUESTED IS MORE THAN WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN STOCK. THE MOST WE CAN PROVIDE IS 0. PLEASE GO BACK AND SELECT A SMALLER QUANTITY.

Somebody's already posted an accurate response to this:

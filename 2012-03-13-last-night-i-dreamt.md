Dear Diary,

Last night I dreamt that the news were on while in Barcelona. X was in the shower and I watched CNN where some shit-fragrant news-caster told me that Morrissey had died, 39 years of age, from apparent heart failure.

In the background, they played "_Lifeguard On Duty_":

> Lifeguard Save me from life Save me from life Save me from the ails, and the ills and from other things

"What total bastards", I thought, as the news went on proclaiming a nuclear disaster ((Which probably is lifted from [this story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_%28The_Smiths_song%29#Composition_and_lyrics).))somewhere in the world.

X stepped out from the shower, happy as an E'd-up Spud, and I started crying, not knowing how I'd tell her the truth, while I was wondering how come Morrissey was only 39 years old.

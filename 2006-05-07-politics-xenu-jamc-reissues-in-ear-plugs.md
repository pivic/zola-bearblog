![Colbert vs Dubya](http://static.flickr.com/45/140441958_293ad220d1_m.jpg)From Memeklas, the blogger formerly known as Niklas: if you're not going to [sing "Stairway to Heaven" backwards](http://www.looptvandfilm.com/blog/stairway/stairway.html), you can always [be Stephen Colbert and rule the USA](http://dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/4/30/1441/59811). Just like [Jon Stewart loves him to](http://editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002426019&imw=Y). But why not [double-talk like Lady Dubya](http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2006/05/lady_doubletalk.html)? Watch that clip from "The Daily Show" and marvel at her amazing rhetorics. Or you can stop and wonder [why people uninstall Firefox](http://people.mozilla.com/~schrep/survey2.png), while [Apple hates Somethingawful](http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/05/06/2045255) for discussing why the new Macintosh laptops run at 95 degrees Celsius at times.

Or you could opt to see "Mission Impossible 3" [like Xenu would](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/05/lord_xenu_makes_came.html). Oh, don't we love the guy wearing a tee that says "Psychiatry is a FRAUD"? I'd like to inject that man with ten cafÃ© lattes; the effect, oh, [the effect](http://www.bustedtees.com/shirt/imsoexcited/male). Like [Sarah Silverman as David Chappelle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IpWhUedQlo).

Oh, [The Jesus And Mary Chain are reissuing all their albums](http://www.filter-mag.com/news/interior.3188.html), or rather, Rhino are, come 2006-06-11. _Finally_:

> The Dual Disc packages feature a remastered version of the album on the audio side, while the DVD side boasts a high-resolution audio mix and three music videos from the era.

I've basically worn out their ["Psychocandy"](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=niklasblog-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00000I2UF)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1) as I've played it more than fifty times (without exaggeration) already. I will get all of these reissues, yes, I will. In the mean-time, feel free to get hold of [Rhino's 180-gram vinyl-version of "Psychocandy"](http://rhino.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=78059). The "[Upcoming Releases-page](http://rhino.com/store/upcoming.lasso)" at Rhino doesn't reveal much yet on the reissues, but I'm waiting, waiting.

And I might be able to enjoy them with [the coming Sony MDR-EX90SL 13.5mm In-Ear Headset](http://www.atraclife.com/2006/04/03/sony-mdr-ex90sl). Looking nice at 100USD. More info [here](http://news.com.com/2061-10801_3-6067631.html).

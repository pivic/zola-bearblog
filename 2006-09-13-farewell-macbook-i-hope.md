I've had it.

Since I got my MacBook back from [LAN Master](http://www.lan-master.se), I've had to zap the PRAM almost every single time I boot it, in order to boot it correctly. This is how it goes:

1\. I boot the computer. 2. It gives me a hazy screen and nothing else. 3. I press the power-button until it shuts down. 4. I press Cmd+Alt+P+R and the power-button; it zaps the PRAM, I release the buttons and it starts correctly, i.e. displays a non-hazy screen during the boot, plays the Apple boot-up sound and gives me the login-screen.

I was thinking of contacting LAN Master about this today to have this fixed, but _this very morning_, something else happened: the computer would not boot despite performing the above procedure. I tried to PMU it. Didn't work.

I called [inLife](http://www.inlife.se), the retailer from where I bought the MacBook, and was patched through to a person who heard me say I wanted to annul my purchase. He told me I had to contact Apple on why, first, but I said that's not the case; according to the [The Swedish Consumer Agency](http://www.konsumentverket.se/mallar/en/startsidan.asp?lngCategoryId=646) I can ask to annul any purchase within reasonable time if the product or service displays an _essential_ flaw. If the flaw is essential or not is up to me, and I seriously doubt anybody would say my claim is ludicrous.

I was connected to another person at the support department at inLife, who was quite service-minded. He told me that Apple, "a couple of days ago", have upgraded "the version of the logic" (which I guess means that they have either upgraded the software for the motherboard or upgraded the motherboard itself) which "should solve all of your issues", he told me. Both he and I agreed that Apple have not posted any information whatsoever, saying this problem would, in fact, solve my issues, and he stated he had a strong "gut feeling" my problems would be solved by this.

No disrespect to the nice person's gut, but I'd rather fling myself at a pitchfork rather than wait for Apple to correct this. I cannot believe the arrogance they're displaying about this matter; being silent _is_ saying "we don't give a toss about you", foremost to the customer, but also to their own people, i.e. the front-line at AppleCare who cannot say more than "we don't know" about the matter. Apple has to lose their [air of secrecy](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1018) if they wish to gain respect and not lose it.

My contact with inLife ended with the support-person telling me he would further my case to one of his colleagues, who would probably call me today. I hope this matter can be swiftly and promptly handled by inLife. Should that be the case, well, I will most definitely keep them in mind if I ever return to purchasing a product made by Apple.

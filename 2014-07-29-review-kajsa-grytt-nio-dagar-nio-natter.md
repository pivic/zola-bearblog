[![Nio dagar, nio nätter](http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1385849075m/19072613.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19072613)[Nio dagar, nio nätter](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19072613) by [Kajsa Grytt](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4840427)  
My rating: [3 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/995698523)  
  
This book is in Swedish, but yes, I'm reviewing it in English.

It's not very pretentious, which is one of its fortés, but it lacks in the dialogue, which feels strained and forced at best. The interchanging between the four characters is well executed, and I am a sucker for reading about characters roaming around Stockholm; it's well done.

Just like Grytt, I have also worked in the Swedish Social Services - actually I've changed Grytt's network password once, fancy that - and I recognise that "Alpen" and "Eken" are actually words from within the Social Services that refer to a registry system and a half-way house, respectively. Grytt has herself worked for a recovery facility in Västberga, Stockholm.

All in all: entertaining, real, yet the dialogue should have been more well-written, and I also think the book slacked some where pace in concerned almost half-way through the book.

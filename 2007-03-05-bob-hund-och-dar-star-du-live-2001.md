![bob hund, 2001](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-03-05-bobhund.jpg)[bob hund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_hund) is one of the bands I'm utterly happy to have seen live. Their albums are great and I perennially find myself trying to push their stuff into the hands of friends as well as complete strangers, obviously.

This is a six-piece rock band with more will to live and breathe than most bands I know put together. Ask me why I love them and I cannot give you a straight explanation; it's like trying to verbally disassemble an orgasm, create a dandelion or choke yourself to death: hard. The closest connections to other bands I can think of is a mix of [Pixies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies), [Kraftwerk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk) and [The Stooges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stooges) with a real dash of uniqueness.

This track is from their greatest hits-compilation called "10 år bakåt & 100 år framåt" which was released 10 years after the band started, and I really recommend that album if you want to sample more of them; it consists of two discs, one with studio-tracks and the other with a live gig they played in London in 2001, from where this track is pinched. I've manually edited it some to give you Swedes a treat of Tomas à–berg's brilliant talk before and after tracks; rarely has any stage been graced with such a presence of verbal force, dangerous dance, seminal lyrics and use of stupidity.

The bit in the track where I explode: right after the bass-and-drums break where à–berg erupts with the rest of the band. One only has to listen to a small portion of this track to realise what [Graham Coxon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Coxon) was on about when talking about the band while donning a bob hund t-shirt on the cover of Q Magazine a bunch of years back.

For an amateur translation of the lyrics in English, check [this page](http://hem.bredband.net/robcum/Musik/Bobhund/bob_hund11.html) and search for "and there you are". Swedish rocks, but if you need bob hund with English song, they're then called [Bergman Rock](http://www.bergmanrock.com) and play a different set of tracks; I recommend [this video for the track "Jim"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNOcNq0wKI0).

For more free music by bob hund, check [this official page](http://www.silence.se/bobhund/ljud/ingenting/default.asp?m1=&m2=download&typ=256&text=ingenting) out, where you can download a very old not-very-officially-released album of theirs, called "Ingenting".

As usual, the track will be removed a week after it has been posted here.

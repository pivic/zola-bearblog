This evening, I saw a great documentary called "[The God Who Wasn't There](http://www.thegodmovie.com)". In it, the main maker of said documentary, starts with an image of the Sun. Then, you get to see Earth circling it. "But", a narrating voice tells us, "it wasn't always that way", he continues. "The Sun used to revolve around the Earth, it was like that for hundreds of years, until it was discovered to be otherwise - and, even, for a few hundred years after that. But, ultimately, after much kicking and screaming, the Earth did, in fact, begin to revolve around the Sun. Christianity was wrong about the solar-system. What if it's wrong about something else, too? This movie is about what happened when I went looking for Jesus." That's the voice of Brian Flemming, the man who made the documentary. In it, he goes looking for the truth behind Christianity. It's quite the interesting doc, and I don't want to give too much away, but this is a snippet of what it contains:

> In this provocative, critically acclaimed documentary, you will discover:
> 
> The early founders of Christianity seem wholly unaware of the idea of a human Jesus
> 
> The Jesus of the Gospels bears a striking resemblance to other ancient heroes and the figureheads of pagan savior cults
> 
> Contemporary Christians are largely ignorant of the origins of their religion
> 
> Fundamentalism is as strong today as it ever has been, with an alarming 44% of Americans believing Jesus will return to earth in their lifetimes
> 
> And God simply isn't there

Well, there you go.  

Wait, I'm not through. The interesting part of this is where [Sam Harris](http://www.samharris.org) says something like: "If a person says he or she is a great surgeon, that he/she has come up with ground-breaking surgical methods and would like to practice them, you would probably go 'Well, let's see your scientific evidence for it', and if that person tells you he/she can't show it to you, that said practices are _felt_ and not scientifically proven, he/she'd get laughed out the room. But that doesn't happen to people of faith."

The power of faith is indeed strong, and at times runs over the intellect without stopping. At work today, a bunch of my colleagues and myself sat around a table, where we discussed issues. Once again, we slipped into the old man-vs-woman stuff. In Sweden, there's a new political organisation, called [Feministiskt Initiativ](http://www.feministisktinitiativ.se) (Fi, for short). When they first arrived on the political scene, just a few months ago, people started stirring almost immediately, throwing quotes and images making me recall Valerie Solanas' "S.C.U.M. Manifesto". I didn't care much about the organisation at first, until people started talking shit incessantly about them. I decided to check their web-page out, where they've got their agenda written down. Anyway, about Fi: I haven't heard as many distorted quotes and pre-conceptions about a Swedish political organisation (or even a party), since Ny Demokrati, a very short-lived anti-immigrant party, came along and flaunted such themselves. Fi is, according their official web-page, a non-profit organisation that place feministic questions first, when it comes to the political agenda.

Mind you, I've found that a lot of people cannot define feminism. I have met many people who've instantly retorted a "Everybody knows that!" but cannot explain the term. What it actually means, is a point of view stating that men and women should be equal, in social, political and economical senses. Does anybody say that should _not_ be the case? Thought you'd agree with me. Many Swedish political parties say that they obviously share that feministic sentiment of Fi, even though they don't say it as loud. Now, the problem is that Swedish women still are very much second to men, when it comes to quoted "obvious stands". Of course, this means that feminism still does not yet truly exist in Sweden.  

Back to the milieu at the tableu. Usually, I find that people say things hap-hazardly. I do it myself, but I can stand corrected with no error, if that's the case. Caught red-handed not knowing what to say? No problem, I'll gladly admit my mistake and move on, taking something of value with me. The problem is not that I think many people don't know what to believe about Fi. My problem is that ignorance isn't stopping a lot of them to accuse, and even slander them without a thought about facts. Here are a few of the quotes from the people around the table at this specific time:

- Fi wants to fight for _women only_ to have the right to work 6 hours a day
- Tiina Rosenberg (one of the members of the board) has said that women who sleep with men are _gender-traitors_
- "What damn bitches they are."

Except that I didn't ask the person who called them bitches to explain away, the rest had to. The first quote quickly turned into "Well...maybe it's Vänsterpartiet (=Swedish leftist party) that said so", which is also wrong, and the other one is simply jibberish. Check out [this interview](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1042&a=463156&previousRenderType=6) (in Swedish) with Rosenberg, who by the way is a Professor in Gender Sciences, where she debunks that quote (among a lot of other pap, plus writes about receiving death-threats just because she's a member of the board in the most popular Swedish feministic organisation).

I told the person who called them bitches that I understood Fi thoroughly through their web-site and that I think their politics make more sense than that of any of the current Swedish major parties. I also told said person that even though Fi want to attain a feministic society by destroying the patriarchal system we live according to, today, it's equivalent of any struggle where the discriminated want to destroy the evil that's opposing them. In this case, they want to destroy a really bad thing, of course. As a parallel, I suggested Iraqis who fight for their life against American forces. My dear colleague said "That's not a good comparison" to which I said "Why not?" to which he said nothing. Dead silence.  

Once again, here's **something felt, but not scientifically proven**. One doesn't have to be a demi-God to ask for proof. If there is none, rest assured a person who says he/she's telling the truth, is probably lying.  
  
So the bitch was, in fact, he.

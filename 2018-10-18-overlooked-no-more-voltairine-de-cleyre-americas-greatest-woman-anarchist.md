First, I'd like to credit Michael B. Dougherty for writing the article above which made me discover de Cleyre: thank you.

Second, just read this, from his article:

> At 24, Voltairine de Cleyre appeared before Philadelphia’s Unity Congregation to deliver a lecture, provocatively titled [“Sex Slavery.”](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43098/43098-h/43098-h.htm#Sex-Slavery)
> 
> She appealed to the assembled crowd: “Let woman ask herself, ‘Why am I the slave of man? Why is my brain said not to be the equal of his brain? Why is my work not paid equally with his?’ ”
> 
> The year was 1890. 

To imagine that taking place, one must let our minds travel to a world where non-men were to be seen but not heard, appeasing men.

_Then_,

And how about some bone-hard convictions?

> The following year de Cleyre had her own brush with an assassin. A former student of hers who had become romantically obsessed with her shot her in a jealous rage. She survived, and then worked for his release on her recovery.
> 
> “It would be an outrage against civilization if he were sent to jail for an act which was the product of a diseased brain,” she wrote.

She had her shit sorted—if one shies away from the fact that she sadly turned mentally ill towards the end of her life, dying only 45 years old.

> Her contemporary, Emma Goldman, called her “the poet-rebel, the liberty-loving artist, the greatest woman anarchist of America.”

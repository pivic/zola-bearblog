[Henrik Berggren](https://www.instagram.com/_henrik.berggren_/) is one of the most celebrated figures of Swedish music in perhaps a century. His work in [Broder Daniel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broder_Daniel), along with his ongoing solo work, has influenced generations of Swedish listeners.

Afflicted by [chronic fatigue syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome)—unknown to the general public—he has been away for a long time.

Now he's being highlighted in a brand-new documentary that today is premiered for free at [this web site](https://www.illbegonefilm.com/). It's available for a limited time only, so see it soon! Also, sign [their petition](https://www.illbegonefilm.com/action) to have Broder Daniel's music returned to Warner/Parlophone Label Group and re-auctioned.

This film is lovingly composed by independent-documentary filmmakers Amelia Trask and Sasha Hecht, who made the film with Henrik Berggren's full cooperation.

People like Håkan Hellström, Lars Malmros, the magazine _Magasinet Filter_, and the company Woah Dad, all agreed to help.

What happened after that is a story of broken promises, nefarious greed, threats, and journalistic fallacies; the love of music is nowhere in what those people did. It's important to stress that none of these things is applicable to Henrik Berggren.

Read the [conflict timeline](https://www.illbegonefilm.com/conflict-timeline) and the [documents](https://www.illbegonefilm.com/documents) and make your own mind up. And stay far away from those kinds of vampires.

The truth sets you free.

[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-07-07-pile.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-07-07)Today I went to [Bonden](http://www.bondenbar.nu/bar.html) to pick up my monies due from [DJ'ing on the 17th of June](https://niklasblog.com/?p=662). The guy who hired me for the gig hasn't exactly been fervent in letting me get my pay - in fact, I had to call, e-mail and text (SMS) him in order to get my cash, and in a quite unorthodox way; I picked up all the money that the two other DJ's of the evening are to split, and am to give the guy the dosh later next week. Mental note: _never, ever, ever_ deal with an unprofessional person again when it comes to DJ'ing.

On the other hand, I got the chance to take some pictures; [the King of Stockholm](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/24309845) was one, and he wears his title well. It's sad to see a homeless person like [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/24322854), sleeping on the side-walk, yet it's a reality we all have to face. Where I work there's [a unit that works entirely with the homeless](http://www.stockholm.se/templates/template_121.asp_Q_mainframe_E_template_120.asp_Q_number_E_59126_A_category_E_320_A_cat1_E_163_A_cat2_E_394_A_cat3_E_13123_A_cat4_E_13079_A_c_E_13123_A_name_E_Enheten+f%F6r+heml%F6sa) and [here](http://www.stockholm.se/templates/template_120.asp_Q_number_E_1191_A_category_E_320_A_cat1_E_163_A_cat2_E_394_A_cat3_E_13123_A_c_E_394_A_name_E_Heml%F6sa) is some info and some tips on how homeless persons can help themselves, and how you can help them to help themselves! There are thousands of homeless persons in Stockholm, and they all have the right, by law, to have a roof over their heads every single night - _if_ they contact their municipality about it, before midnight, and it doesn't cost them a penny.

I took [this picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/24255117) of a Bush quote ("The killers have evil in their heart") and posted it on flickr. Wazoo, over three-thousand views later, it's become a political thing. Luckily, people have better things to care about than that particular photograph, so they view either the gory or the personal pictures. I favour the personal ones, any day of the week. "Gory personal" would be OK, I think, but those haven't surfaced; people only take pictures of magazine covers or the TV, often showing people bleeding.

Another thing I noticed right after the attacks happened, was the difference between BBC World and CNN; BBC World spoke about terrorism and fear to a small level, and seemed quite interested in getting to know who had committed the heinous deeds before blaming an organisation. CNN was much more...fire and brimstone, wanting to find a scapegoat, letting their commentators use a lot of superlatives all the time, staying aggressive. Woo-hah! You don't have to be [Al Pacino](http://images.art.com/images/products/regular/10103000/10103257.jpg) to know what's going on. I wonder what FOX News are saying about all this. Do you think "Bomb Osama!" is too far off target?

Mikaela made a very nice omelet today, consisting of broccoli, chorizo, yellow onion, red paprika, salt and ground black peppers with a lovely lentil-based salad. Mmm. Tomorrow I'm making pasta putana after a recipe by Jamie Oliver.

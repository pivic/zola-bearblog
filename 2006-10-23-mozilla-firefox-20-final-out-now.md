[Not announced yet](http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&id=35772), but you can download the final version of Firefox 2.0 from Mozilla.org's FTP-servers. Mind you, they're choked right now, but you can get the American-English version straight from [here](http://mozilla.osuosl.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/2.0/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%202.0.exe) at high speed.

[Here](http://arstechnica.com/reviews/apps/firefox2-rc2.ars)'s the best round-up of the new features that I've found.

**edit**: a mirror for all available languages is found [here](http://mozilla.ussg.indiana.edu/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/2.0/win32/).

I also recommend downloading [the British-English dictionary](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3366/).

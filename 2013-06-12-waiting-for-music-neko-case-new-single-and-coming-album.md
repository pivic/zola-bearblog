Finally, **[Neko Case](http://nekocase.com)** is releasing an album, titled "_The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You_", on September 3rd. Seeing her play live at the Primavera Sound festival this year was lovely, and she played a couple of new tracks; they sounded clearly different from her last two albums, and they were a long distance from "_[Fox Confessor Brings The Flood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Confessor_Brings_the_Flood)_", that in my mind is her Masterpiece so far.

Here's an album trailer and the first single from the album; the track is named "_Man_" and features M. Ward on guitar.

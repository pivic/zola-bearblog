I just ordered "[Night Fisher](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=niklasblog-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/1560977191)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)", a graphic novel by R. Kikuo Johnson, that looks very interesting. Check the URL out, and while there, look some in the book. The style is black-and-white sloppy, yet not sloppy at all. Don't I have a way with words.

Don't forget to get [your Steven Segal drink.](http://www.xoxide.com/lightning-bolt-asian-experiance.html)

If you're into making music using a sequencer, check [this link](http://www.vstunnel.com/en). Description lifted from the site:

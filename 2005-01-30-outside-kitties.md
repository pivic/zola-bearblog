[Here](http://www.video-c.co.uk/micrositelaunch.asp?vidref=fatb003)'s a link leading to the new Fatboy Slim video that's made by the winner of a contest to make a video for him. Hundreds of kittens!

I had my hair cut by Nicola at Twisted yesterday. Very nice (as usual I must say) and it turned out like [this](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-01-30-me.jpg). Note that the picture is taken after we'd come home last night, semi-drunk. Looks weird, doesn't it? Well, as I've stated before, I'm someday going to get myself a camera with a decent flash.

We went out last night, met Staffan, Patrik and Anos at Gondolen, a place up high in the sky, center of Stockholm, where the bartenders make wonderful drinks. We went crazy on the drinks, Mikaela downing Ginger Drops like mad and me trying everything from their Knickerbocker Special (quite nice even though it's a mad mix of ingredients that makes you wonder how ever the person who invented it thought in the first place) and Top Dog (dishwash-looking-and-almost-tasting drink with a salt-frosted rim) to their Gondolen Sour (their variety of the Pisco Sour, which was served in a very small glass, red in colour, extremely sour-sweet to the taste) . Very nice!

Anos left to meet friends at Golden Hits, a schlager place. We went on to Sidetracks, a gay bar \[[gay bar! gay bar!](http://www.rathergood.com/gaybar)\] where old people stood still in the hallways while 80's semi-electro-hits blasted. I liked the music, which seemed to be emanating from somewhere live, as new stuff was also incorporated into the mix. We left and headed for Skratch, a bar a few yards from Sidetracks. It was virtually dead. A few of its clientele couldn't leave their chairs as they would have fallen off.

We then said good-bye to Patrik and Staffan, and went home to shower and fall asleep. The end!

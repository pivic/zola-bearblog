![Belle and Sebastian - Sonics](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-12-20-bs.jpg)_What you gonna put/Under my Christmas tree?_

Four years and two days ago, [Belle and Sebastian](http://www.belleandsebastian.co.uk) played a blinding set consisting mainly of Christmas tracks for [John Peel](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel)'s yuletide show. I don't know how many times I've played that album, and I've grown to love a lot of their covers.

Among them is this classic, [The Sonics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sonics)' "Santa Claus", which B&S churns out in a true-to-word garage version. Even though the double-A-side of the original track is "I Don't Believe In Christmas", this should be a modern classic next to "[A Christmas Gift To You From Phil Spector](http://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Gift-You-Phil-Spector/dp/B000003BD7)".

Pardon me for the glitches in the track, and it's snagged over analogue radio, so expect no [DAB](http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalradio/about). As usual, the track will be deleted in a week.

P.s. Don't miss out on DJ Riko's "[Merry Mixmas 2006](http://www.djriko.com/html/mixmases.htm)" for a newish snowy treat!

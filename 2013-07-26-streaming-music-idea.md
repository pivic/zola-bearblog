Since Spotify and most other big music-streaming companies [don't care much for paying the artists what they really should earn](http://pinterest.com/pin/59954238760687736/), I've got an idea that's got streaming music covered.

As a user, you pay a fixed sum every month that you subscribe. Depending on what you play, the money goes to the record label (or unsigned artist) that you play; they earn a different amount depending on how many times you've played their artists.

Simple, right? Of course a bit of the money must go to the streaming supplier, but otherwise I can't see this model failing.

Say you play 100 tracks on one month. 45 of these are [Okkervil River](http://okkervilriver.com) tracks. So, their labels (that they have been and are signed to) get 45% of your monthly subscription money (minus what the streaming service needs, _and is reasonable_). And Okkervil gets their fair cut of that, and not the shitty $100 per 1 billion plays that Spotify and their ilk pay, or use to insult the artist with, I should say.

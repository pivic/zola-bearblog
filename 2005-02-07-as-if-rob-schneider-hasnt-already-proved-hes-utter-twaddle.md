As if everybody doesn't already know [Rob Schneider](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001705)'s an idiot, check out [this link](http://www.defamer.com/hollywood/gossip/rob-schneider/by-request-rob-schneiders-attack-ad-032113.php). In it, you'll see the full-page-advertisement he's paid to have shown in "Variety" magazine, where he slams a reviewer. That's right. He shows he's an idiot by saying somebody who reviews his latest film is an idiot. At least he's being his crap self, I'll give him that much.

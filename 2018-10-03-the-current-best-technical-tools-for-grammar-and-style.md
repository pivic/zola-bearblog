A ProductHunt user [asked](https://www.producthunt.com/ask/10508-what-tool-do-you-use-to-correct-grammar-and-spelling) which products others use for correcting grammar and spelling, so I answered; here's my answer, rewritten.

* * *

I'm going for **[Grammarly](http://grammarly.com)**. I am a premium user—i.e. I'm paying for it—and there are many advantages that go with this, mainly as it corrects my language _and_ style depending on what kind of documents I'm writing; this is especially helpful when using their standalone app, which allows you to set goals when writing/importing a new document. A screenshot of this:

Also, I must shout out to **Microsoft Word** as it is today. I'm using the Word 365 version, where their "Grammar & Refinements" section is greatly improved where it comes to correcting style.

Here are a few screenshots of what they're checking, e.g. "Clarity and Conciseness":

"Formal Language" and "Inclusive Language", which is very interesting where "bias" is concerned:

...and "Punctuation Conventions":

Still, I believe Grammarly truly shines where using their "Insights"; an example of this:

Grammarly wins for reasons of clarity, style, and simplicity. Still, they have a long way to go where technical writing is concerned; I use [Microsoft's Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide) professionally, and Grammarly is not really adhering to their ways of thinking. Gotta give MS claps for using GitHub for their Style Guide, by the way. All in all: Grammarly is something I dig, as it allows [the use of add-ons for Chrome, Firefox, et cetera, and also plugins for the MS Office products](https://app.grammarly.com/apps).

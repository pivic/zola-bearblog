[The Angel's Game](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4912857) by [Carlos Ruiz Zafón](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/815)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1011963363)  
  
This is an epic tale. Not as a fable, but more as a detective/mystery/friendship/love story. It is so well-written, that any cliché is useless against it. Sure, it contains a few usual pushes and pulls, common in detective stories, but for example, one quarter into the book, it goes into a completely (for me) direction than I expected, and it goes on like that. Not in a tiresome way, because the book really breathes; it allows the reader to go up and down and back and forth in great ways. And there's love. And people lovelorn:

> Tomorrow, or perhaps the next day, I’ll write again to tell you that I love you, even if it means nothing to you.

> ‘I owe you much more than an explanation . . .’ ‘Then tell me about her.’ Vidal looked at me with desperate eyes that begged me to lie to him.

There's so much more to this book than I'm able to do justice to. It's truly an epic book, which is very well told. Recommended for all who like mysteries, suspense, figuring stuff out and...well, people who like to read should read this. :-)

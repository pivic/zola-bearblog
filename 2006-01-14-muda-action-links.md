[![Meet the Mudas](http://static.flickr.com/41/86367360_55737ef5e2_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=86367360) In the beginning, there was [_testis_](http://www.answers.com/testis). The most popular Slavic slang-word for testis is _muda_. Hence, imagine my surprise this morning, when I opened up a page displaying a bunch of people trying out different types of foods, and two of the people involved both carried the surname Muda. The male even has [a muda web site](http://www.muda.se). By Bog, I've actually DJ'ed with him once, during the IT boom! Scary. Anyway, I salute you Mudas. Bog, I wish I could acquire the site jebi.se.

Turning to something else, Mikaela was thrilled to see that another place for clobber has opened up in Stockholm. [Beyond Retro](http://www.beyondretro.com) is a well respected English place, which has now opened in Stockholm. The place is a former bicycle-shop where one can now find over 5000 pieces of clothing; among them, loads of vintage stuff from the 50's to the 90's, and everything's from the USA. They're having an opening party on the 26th, this month.

Speaking of the USA, [I did mention](https://niklasblog.com/?p=853) that Microsoft censored a Chinese blogger who was critical against the Chinese government, a while ago. I did not, however, know that [Yahoo! was doing the same thing](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/13/nazi_yahoo_defeat), until yesterday. Well, Yahoo! have just lost a court battle where they 1) wanted the right to sell nazi merch off their site and 2) really not care about laws. Interesting.

Do you want to move to using merely OpenOffice as your Office software of choice? Then your only problem is converting existing Office files, probably manufactured using another piece of Office software, right? Sifting through tedious amounts of files and re-saving them in another format is Hell, so check [this page](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/01/11/from-microsoft-to-openoffice.html) and learn how to batch-convert any number of Office files into different formats, through OpenOffice.

I just read an interesting post on a boy wanting a PSP so bad, not only does he know everything about the console and the games for it, but he's even drawn loads of pictures of the thing - and sold them for 15 US cents a piece, so that he may one day afford a PSP. What he (I suppose) doesn't know yet, is that a PSP has been bought for him due to donations made through [this post](http://hooptyrides.blogspot.com/2006/01/hooptyrides-corporate-art-collection.html). Pictures of the PSP are to follow - I sincerely hope. Damn, that kid seems even more materialistic and manic than myself!

Another good WordPress 2.0 plugin: [Contact Form \]\[](http://chip.cuccio.us/projects/contact-form-ii). Scary name, great feature, especially if you're seeking to communicate with your readers. I might be using that in a contest later this month. _Same bat-channel_, bitches.

[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-07-12-honeydrippers.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-07-12-seaoflove.mp3)This podcast is entirely about The Honeydrippers' 80's cover of Phil Phillips' 50's slick love-song "Sea of Love".

It's a really slick, 80's production, but apart from that, it's got Robert Plant and Jimmy Page (aka [Led Zeppelin](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:ngjueat04xg7)) on it, plus [Jeff Beck](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:7udsyl2jxp9b), [Nile Rodgers](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:g9d0ylkjxpvb) (half of one of the few good disco bands, [Chic](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wifxlfhe5cqi)) and [Paul Shaffer](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:5sua6j4h71u0) (...the Letterman Show - but remember, folks, he's actually responsible for having written "[It's Raining Men](http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/coldfeet/itsrainingmen.htm)"). They're cast as [The Honeydrippers](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:2e861vyjzzza), and they're pouring their honey's worth into this slimey, great ballad.

This is buttery r 'n' b, and good. Get it [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-07-12-seaoflove.mp3).

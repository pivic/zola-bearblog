A British rock-journo got thrown out of Interpol's dressing room the other day, true story. When noticing they couldn't tell the difference between New Order and Radiohead, he said: "You're just an American rock band, so you're not meant to understand anything." From a [DN article](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1323&a=349326) on their recent gig in Stockholm.

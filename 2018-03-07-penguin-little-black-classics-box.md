As you see, I got hold of the Penguin Little Black Classics box. It's a collection of 80 books from Penguin's classics series, every kind of stuff from Dostoyevsky to Shaw, Wilde, Chekhov, Balzac, Ovid, Austen, Sappho, and Dante. It's a lot of books, and I got it on sale - thank Bog!

Can't wait to get into authors that I've never even heard of, and those whose works I've just felt to be too..._classic?..._to get into.

It's time. Here goes.

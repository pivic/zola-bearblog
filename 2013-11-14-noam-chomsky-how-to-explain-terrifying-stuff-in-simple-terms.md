[![Noam Chomsky](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2013-11-14_1124.png)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2013-11-14_1124.png)

From **[Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky)**'s "[_How The World Works_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10728838-how-the-world-works)":

> The doctrinal system, which produces what we call “propaganda” when discussing enemies, has two distinct targets. One target is what’s sometimes called the “political class,” the roughly 20% of the population that’s relatively educated, more or less articulate, playing some role in decision-making. Their acceptance of doctrine is crucial, because they’re in a position to design and implement policy. Then there’s the other 80% or so of the population. These are [Lippmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Lippmann)’s “spectators of action,” whom he referred to as the “bewildered herd.” [They are supposed to follow orders and keep out of the way of the important people. They’re the target of the real mass media: the tabloids, the sitcoms, the Super Bowl and so on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfd0_7BcU-0).
> 
> These sectors of the doctrinal system serve to divert the unwashed masses and reinforce the basic social values: passivity, submissiveness to authority, the overriding virtue of greed and personal gain, lack of concern for others, fear of real or imagined enemies, etc. The goal is to keep the bewildered herd bewildered. It’s unnecessary for them to trouble themselves with what’s happening in the world. In fact, it’s undesirable—if they see too much of reality they may set themselves to change it.
> 
> That’s not to say that the media can’t be influenced by the general population. The dominant institutions—whether political, economic or doctrinal—are not immune to public pressures. Independent (alternative) media can also play an important role. Though they lack resources, almost by definition, they gain significance in the same way that popular organizations do: by bringing together people with limited resources who can multiply their effectiveness, and their own understanding, through their interactions—precisely the democratic threat that’s so feared by dominant elites.

This evening, Mikaela and I have attempted to get the minipods onto one of our living-room walls. Believe me, the old saying is true: just because something is more expensive than IKEA, don't figure it to react that way.

When we finally had drilled three holes for the device that will hold the first speaker, we meticulously used a water level to fit it and then mounted the screws...to find that the blasted bottom part that holds it in place wasn't properly fitted with the aluminium stick that fits in it. Hence, it missed appx. three millimeters, causing our project to be delayed, at least until tomorrow, when I'll be visiting [Hifi Klubben](http://hifiklubben.se) with the stuff in hand. Aw, the agony.

Alas, we wanted to try the speakers out. As you can probably catch an inkling of, thanks to my trusty, hated Pocket PC, the minipods are blaring [Underworld](http://www.awrc.com/review/u/dark_and_long.html) and the sound is remarkably crisp. I'm no audiophile when it comes to speakers, but these are very nice indeed. The former ones, a couple of big speakers by Sony surely produced more of a wall of sound, but these small ones will rock when they're properly in place.

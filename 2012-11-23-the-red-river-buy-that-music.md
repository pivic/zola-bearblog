The fact that you can buy all of [**The Red River**](http://theredriver.bandcamp.com)'s albums for a mere $10 is astounding. Click the link above. Go! And you'll find a lot more links by hovering the mouse button on top of the band pic.

Just listen to some of the tracks from "[_Little Songs About The Big Picture_](http://theredriver.bandcamp.com/album/little-songs-about-the-big-picture)" which is a really good album. And you can get it for $5. Sick!

The music is almost Voxtrot mixed with Scott Brackett and David Lynch. With a feel of people sitting around a campfire with a guitar and makeshift percussion stuff. And some horns and triangles thrown in sometimes. It's better than I make it out to be. By the way, isn't "_Grand Fasse_" quite like the old "_White Christmas_" just between two chord changes? The Red River track is an indie crooner track. As though Frank Sinatra sung with another person's voice, having been raised by Okkervil River.

**Bonus**: a) [an NPR mini desk concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKiZB_ltXM0) and b) Bill Roberts from The Red River's [mixtape](http://www.indierockreviews.com/2010/11/the-red-river-mixtape-by-dhani-rosa).

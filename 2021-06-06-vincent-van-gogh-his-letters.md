I'm reading a lovely and fairly new and abridged book that contains letters from Vincent van Gogh.

It is breathtakingly naturist and honestly told; they are letters and Vincent van Gogh was a beautiful thinker and writer.

I will write a review of this book soon after I've finished it. [Here](https://niklas.reviews).

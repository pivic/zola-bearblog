Well, even though Apple aren't the ones fixing my laptop, the gracious people who are currently repairing it - as well as being really professional and nice - also known as [LAN Master](http://www.lan-master.com), Apple should get off their ass and start fixing stuff rather than only voicing that people want MacBooks so much [they still can't meet demand](http://blog.wired.com/cultofmac/index.blog?entry_id=1544183).

Meet this: owning a MacBook is splendid, while it works. When it's not, you're a stepchild. And your adoptive family are the Hitlers. And even though that family may give you a lolly at times, it sure is a [horrid fucking lolly](http://www.macuser.com/huh/macbook_saga_hits_a_curve.php).

And oh, [Apple are recalling 1.8 million batteries](http://news.com.com/2100-1041_3-6109198.html). Only strange thing: it doesn't affect MacBooks.

Anyway, [a lot of people aren't happy](http://www.macintouch.com/readerreports/macbook/index.html). I would be...if...I could only touch my Mac from afar...unless if it decided to shut down spontaneously, which would lead to my killing of it. What could be worse, somebody making "[Saw 3](http://www.apple.com/trailers/lions_gate/sawiii/)" or [Jay-Z breaking his promise of never making a comeback](http://www.prefixmag.com/news/Jay-Z/7983)?

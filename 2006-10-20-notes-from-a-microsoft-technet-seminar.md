By the way, the presentation of Office 2007 was great, and Sharepoint Portal Server 2007 wasn't very convincing, at least not for me.

**edit**: [MS and Apple spew hate at each-other right now](http://portableaudio.engadget.com/2006/10/19/microsoft-blames-apples-quality-checks-for-ipod-virus) as Apple managed to sell iPods that were carrying virii. As this virus was spread by a person in the manufacturing-process who was using Windows...Apple blamed Microsoft for it. Really. That's weak. Microsoft, in turn, have acted against Apple using [Tyra Banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyra_Banks)' #1 weapon: fierceness. From the Engadget article:

> Microsoft didn't know what they were shipping \[...\] Microsoft's current quality assurance guru, finished off the tongue-lashings by prompting Steve Jobs to "contact Poon if he needed someone to advise on how to improve quality checks."

Fight, fight, fight!

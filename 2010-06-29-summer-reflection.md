Another summer day. Just a week until our Texan friend lands. The week-end was sublime, both meeting Maylinn and The Pirate Cats. Meeting beautiful friends is like falling backwards knowing that you'll be caught, even though you have no idea how. Preferably. Thank Bog. They're emotional in a variety of ways and are intelligent in conversation and actions. Of course, this may be somewhat steered off-target as we get drunk together. No matter what, they are funny.

Every morning, lunch and late afternoon I walk next to a lake where I work. Ducks and children everywhere, human and ducks alike. The ducklings grow up quickly and show little fear as I bend down to photograph them.

Their seemingly innocent behaviour strangely reminds me of a book that X and I are reading now, "[I huvudet på en seriemördare](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8291293-i-huvudet-p-en-seriem-rdare)" by Sven å. Christianson. There's a passage we read yesterday where the author comments on a TV-series called "_Ondskan_" (="The Evil") where the host, [Hasse Aro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse%20Aro), intertwines stupidity and a mighty propensity to find "evil" to be what causes people to kill. And also personality disorders. Yes, he is that stupid (and not naà¯ve, as he should definitely know a lot better, having produced TV-shows on crime for decades). "When you're killing, you're 'Asperger-John' and when you're lying, you're 'Psychopath-John'", he says to one of his poorly cut-up interviewees. What a gyp; the persons supposed to be bad are really just caught in the scissors of the production-company. Sure, they've committed crimes, but [damn Aro and his cohorts to hell](http://www.expressen.se/1.468485).

Still, my thoughts linger with the ducklings, surrounded by "_Hunted By A Freak_" by Mogwai.

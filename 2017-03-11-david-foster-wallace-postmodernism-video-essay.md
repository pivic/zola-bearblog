The above video and the text contents of [this post](http://www.openculture.com/2017/02/david-foster-wallace-on-whats-wrong-with-postmodernism-a-video-essay.html) say most of it, so I won't reiterate. However, I will say that the video is better than a lot of shit that I've recently seen on the Internet.

When I read both "_[Conversations with David Foster Wallace](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13099799-conversations-with-david-foster-wallace)_" and "[_Every Love Story Is A Ghost Story_](https://niklasblog.com/?p=12525)", I found how Wallace had always been into finding out - not necessarily the truth - but what _matters_, and as such, how caring, wisdom, love and true, meaningful human interaction are at the heart of things. I don't think Wallace came to conclude that based on hard, cold facts, but life and thinking like a motherfucker, much like de Beauvoir and Sartre did. I just refer to those two as that's partly what I got from [this book](https://niklasblog.com/?p=18880).

I really like the examples of "_Parks & Recreation_" and "_The Daily Show_", which can actually use cynical arguments, in a very human, and ultimately non-cynical way.

I just thought of something.

Atheism is very important to talk about. Religions are a major source of an extreme amount of deaths and pain.

But isn't fighting antifeminism just as important, if not more important?

I've found that those I've met throughout the years, who are the biggest self-professed atheists ((And act quite douchebaggian about that, e.g. prone to _schadenfreude_ and acting like they're better than those who aren't atheists themselves.)), are not feminists.

To them: if you want to fight injustice, include _all_ injustice, fucks!

![](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-19-music.gif)I woke up really early, about 07:00. I've slept quite to-and-fro the entire night, waking up from all sorts of happenings: sounds, dreams and the rays of morning sun. The dream that woke me was very weird. It was a waking-up-scared-and-hyperventilating one. I dreamt one of my pals had made it his goal to have sex with a lot of men who were HIV-infected, just to see if he could escape getting the virus. Oh yeah! Anyway, it woke me up.

In the morning I connected [GuitarPort](http://www.guitarport.com/overview.html) to my laptop and went treasure-hunting among the many amp- and mic-sounds that Line6 offers, due to my having a Pod_xt_. [Here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-19-guitarport.gif)'s a little picture of what it looks like. So, I played a few tracks, and recorded them. Why not blog them, then? Here they are \[they're barely over 500KB in size\], bits and pieces; see if you can spot the original tracks where I've covered bits: an [80's-sounding track](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-19-80s.ogg), [a punk track](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-19-blank.ogg), [a Mamas & Papas track](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-19-dream.ogg), [a track where I play a bum note](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-19-err.ogg), [a Stripey track](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-19-leaves.ogg), [an old-skool bling-track](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-19-line.ogg), [a Lou-esque track](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-19-man.ogg) and [a pimpish track](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-19-pimp.ogg). I love the Pod.

Mikaela and I then went to the café where Frederic usually hangs out. [Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-03-19) are pictures from the visit. The owner was given a nice cake from Frederic, which Mikaela had made for [the last time we visited him](https://niklasblog.com/?p=522). This didn't give us any kind of rebate, cheap bastard! Anyway, the coffee was nice and strong, but it resulted in me talking constantly for ten minutes straight. Poor Mikaela. I was dropped off at home, and Mikaela went to Skärholmen to shop.

During that time, I went on with my music. I installed Reason 3.0, a wonderful, truly _wonderful_ piece of music production software. Check out their flash trailer [here](http://www.propellerheads.se/dsp_trailer_pop.cfm), it's great. With Reason, which I've never before used, and its quick start guide PDF-file, I made [a snippet of a cover](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-19-7nationpivic.ogg), merely containing four bars, in 20 minutes. Yes, I created the drum-track before I made the "Seven Nation Army" bass-line. I didn't even think of it until I found the bass sound and thought of the recent cover of the song in question, by [The Flaming Lips](http://promo.mudhut.co.uk/azuli/flaminglipsflyer.htm). I'll make something of it yet. The difficult bit was that I didn't read the manual closely enough. I actually couldn't find the drum machine rhythm patches, as I looked in the wrong place. I re-installed the software and then succeeded - having re-read the bit about where to click to find the patches - a little aggravated with myself. [This is what my Reason lay-up looked like](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-19-reason.gif), having created the drum-track and mapped the bass track in the sequencer.

Now Mikaela's made pesto and some chops. We're going to eat really nice food tonight. I don't really like making food except on few occations, and Mikaela loves it and cooks on her own behest, but I still cannot help feeling like the idiot of the house, who lets his love cook while he just sits by the computer. Well, that's what it looks like, but isn't like. I've made music. Err.

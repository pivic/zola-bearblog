Yesterday, a most singular experience happened to me.

It happened during my lunch-break, as I walked through Medborgarplatsen. Even though a promo of [Clawfinger](http://www.clawfinger.net)'s "Hate Yourself With Style" was blasting through my head, I heard something going on. Looking at the noisy direction, I noted a very wasted, old dwarf in a wheel-chair, who threw a bottle of beer over his shoulder. He hit a very old man on the shoulder, spilling broken glass and beer all over him. Sonofabitch! Even though the idiot seemed very mentally handicapped _and_ drunk, I just wanted to kick his face in, but the old man, the victim was first! Unfortunately he was stopped from buck-whylin' the little fawker, although the old man might actually have gone down; the scary Twin Peaks-ish dwarf flailed his limbs like crazy and yelled. I talked to a guy at the scene, who said he was going to call the cops, so I walked on. No camera that time, sadly, so no pictures to you from that occation.

Speaking of madness, check [this link](http://www.flurl.com/uploaded/Metal_Concert_395.html) out. If you're at work, don't watch it. Otherwise, you must.

Yesterday, X and I went to åhléns and bought ourselves a couple of USA-certified, huge-ass suitcases. The kind you buy and keep for a minimum of 10 years, I hope. Then we went home and had tomato soup with feta cheese. Then a text message from Björn saying he's in a pub in London.

As if I'm not longing enough for Texas... **Longing**. Here's what the weather from my neighbourhood looked like this morning:

Too soon! Too soon! X and I are softly looking at places to visit when in Houston/Austin, and it looks like we'll be filling our suitcases to the brim. I hope!

I can't wait to get home and kick off the weekend.

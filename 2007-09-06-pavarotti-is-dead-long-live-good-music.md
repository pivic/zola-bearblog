![2007-09-06-pavarotti.jpg](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-09-06-pavarotti.jpg)I'm saying Luciano Pavarotti's death is worth celebrating; I'm not referring to him as a person but as a singer!

Opera is something I know very little of. What I do know, however, is that opera is a genre where contemporary singers aren't as technically and emotionally affluent as those of yore were - with exceptions, of course.

To back my bold statement, I bring another bit of music for your ears, this time from the brilliant documentary "Yes, But Can They Sing?" where a narrator lets us humble listeners know what opera's bad and what's good. Even though it's not aimed directly at Pavarotti in the example I offer, it's a reminder saying that if you spend more time searching for quality (e.g. [Jussi Bj√∂rling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussi_Bj%C3%B6rling), [Sena Jurinac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sena_Jurinac)) you can quickly note what's bad (e.g. [Andrea Bocelli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Bocelli), [Sarah Brightman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Brightman)). The example will be deleted in a week.

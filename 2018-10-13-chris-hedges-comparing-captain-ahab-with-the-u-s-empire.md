Chris Hedges, 2007.

It's little wonder that [Chris Hedges](https://www.alternativeradio.org/collections/spk_chris-hedges) has got it in for the imperialistic establishment. Who in their right mind hasn't?

Still, I think it's wondrous to hear somebody rally against how the U.S. of A. is being run as though it's a capitalistic company, designed to whet the never-sated monetary appetite of the elite at the top, while the workers carry the actual issues. TheÂ _real_ issues, if we're being honest.

I had no idea that [Melville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville), who wrote "Moby Dick", had put so many American analogies into the book; then, I'll gladly admit that I've yet to read it. Bar that, the speech isn't for people who've read the book. It's for people who want to see a bit more about the current-day realities of life and how we are affected by others who are basically in it for the short haul, and mainly the money.

I dig both political speakers, philosophers, and stand-up comics who blur the lines between those names. People like [Howard Zinn](https://www.alternativeradio.org/collections/spk_howard-zinn), [Bill Hicks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hicks), and here, Chris Hedges. Also, [Barry Crimmins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Crimmins).

Hedges is a columnist for the site Truthdig, check his stuff [here](https://www.truthdig.com/author/chris_hedges/).

Here's the Moby Dick analogy speech for when the above link goes dead, which speeches from Alternative Radio do, after approximately a week:

Another very important and fresh video thingy, is Chris Hedges's meeting with Noam Chomsky, below in two parts:

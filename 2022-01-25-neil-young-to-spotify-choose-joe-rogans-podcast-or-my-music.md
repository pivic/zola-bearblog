Neil Young has rejected Spotify's love for Joe Rogan's transphobic and antivax podcast, and tries to force them to choose: keep Joe Rogan's podcast or Young will pull his music from Spotify.

This is good. Spotify is supporting Joe Rogan's transphobic and antivax podcast. [I've written about that](https://niklasblog.com/?p=25336).

Like I said back then which is still valid:

Spotify supports Joe Rogan’s transphobia by allowing it to continue, in spite of their own guidelines, which should most likely Joe Rogan’s podcast from Spotify.

Since then, Rogan has started to spout antivax idiocies.

I don't expect Spotify to eject Rogan, their enormous cash cow, who they're paying somewhere in the realm of tens of millions of USD for exclusive access to his show.

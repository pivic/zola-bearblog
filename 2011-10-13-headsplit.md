Feels like my head will obliterate into space. It's that level right now.

Despite that I'm happy to be walking outdoors. Fall is this time just a little passage toward Winter, which will be here soon. I'm looking forward to it.

I'm also looking forward to a warm couch, food and enveloping X in my arms, not necessarily in that order.

I'm reading a lot of Phil Carlo's "_The Night Stalker_", a book on Richard Ramirez, also known as one of the most prolific and odd serial-killers in my mind. Imagine, if you will, heinous, murderous shit done to people of all kinds. Then imagine that performed by a psychopathic satanist with bad teeth, and you're a bit closer. Ramirez is still alive.

All back to working, flaking and perpetrating. And previewing Frank Miller's "[Holy Terror](http://graphicly.com/legendary-comics/holy-terror/preview)".

Why nobody really wants to go on public transport on the Green Line in Stockholm now: buses are the only alternative, and they arrive - and leave - intermittently.

This picture is taken by yours truly yesterday morning; having spent 20 minutes in this queue - which was more than 100 meters long - I gave up. Or rather, my body did. So I went home, sick and defeated. Today SL are supposed to have another crisis meeting to see what they can do about the situation. I'll clap my hands in your favour when you produce tangible, lucid aid.

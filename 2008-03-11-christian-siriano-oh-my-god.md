As this midget, ADD-ish bundle of fierce and fabulous basically made this season of [Project Runway](http://www.bravotv.com/Project_Runway), I hereby present the best moments of his appearances on the show.

The first minute of the video says just about everything and is a treat - or goddamn annoying - even if you've never laid eyes on the series. Go, Christian!

P.s. I've just ordered [this tee](http://wireandtwine.com/store/products/fierce.html) from Wire & Twine. Boo-ya!

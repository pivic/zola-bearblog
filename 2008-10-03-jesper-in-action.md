Jesper came by to say hi which was a real treat! Only problem: he brought a bottle of organic wine. And we brought two. And we had a really nice time, which can be dangerous. So waking up was more moaning than morning; even so, I had a wonderful time last night. Jesper played the guitar, we all talked, laughed and...I've missed him a lot! Anyway, push the tempo and up the volume, here's Jesper playing the guitar.

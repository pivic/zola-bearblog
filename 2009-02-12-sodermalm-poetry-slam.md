Yesterday I met up with X, Andreas, Jenny and her friends at Sjöhästen, where Södermalm [Poetry Slam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry_slam) premiered!

It was really nice; X and I shared a grainy sandwich and laughed with our friends, until we were appointed jury and all had to reach consensus on a grade between 0.0-10.0 after every single performance. First up were the open mic artists; these are mostly first-timers, which showed. I'm saying that in the most loving sense. Some of them might even had relayed their words to others than themselves for the first time, ever. From this lot, there were probably a few interesting bits - even if I can't remember them - and a few very pretentious performances that made me laugh myself to bits. I mean, come-fucking-on, you can't keep your eyes closed, slobber text about how sex makes two become one (but not put as "eloquently") and drag a hand through your hair as you're grabbing the mic; or wait, apparently you can - but if you're not Prince or completely retarded, shut the hell up!

Another guy cited texts that were paint-drying-good, and made me evolve into hysterics and desperately trying to be silent; it didn't work so well, but I didn't catch anyone giving me sore looks, thank Bog.

Then the more experienced poets jumped on-stage, and I think it proved that experience doesn't mean quality. Still, there were a few moments that were beautiful. One guy, whose two total performances were based on repetition, was really forceful, but mostly because of the way he performed, not on the words. Another guy delivered as though Jackie Chan's "[Drunken Master](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080179)" were his mantra, which was so-so. A third guy did quick repetitions as well, mostly based on shitty Swedish tabloid-fodder headlines, but had something that sounded good. Then there was a woman who acted like a modern-day Joe Cocker in movement but wanted to be "[Bound By Honor](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106469)" in words. So-and-so, even though she actually won the entire shebang.

My favourite was named Evy Söderman. I have no idea if her atonal shouting was part of the performance or just the way she worked things, but you have to check this video out. Her second performance, mind you, was even stronger!

It was really fun to see her and a few others perform, also notably Daniel Boyacioglu, famed Swedish poet, rapper and writer. He churned things out with a couple of his poems, written in everyday style, performed as if he were in high-school; very disarming, often very funny and at times thoughtful.

I want to go back for more. Arguing on how to grade some performances was really fun, but sharing the entire experience with my friends was the high for me. Some performances were blazing and reminded me of Saul William's "[Slam](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139615)".

This will go down every Wednesday at Sjöhästen, and also check out [the Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=44873819123) on the matter.

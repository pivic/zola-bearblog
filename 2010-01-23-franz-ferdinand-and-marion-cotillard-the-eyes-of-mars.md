[![The Eyes of Mars](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2010-01-22-theeyesofmars.jpg)](http://www.ladydior.com)

[Franz Ferdinand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz%20Ferdinand%20%28band%29) has written the music and words for the track "_The Eyes of Mars_", which streams as you enter [Lady Dior](http://www.ladydior.com), a commercial site. The track is sung by Oscar-winning actress [Marion Cotillard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion%20Cotillard). I really like it, even though it's extremely simple. I feel I _shouldn'_t like it for some stupid reason, but it's good; there's something about that piano...

> Eyes of a killer are ours The Eyes of Mars...

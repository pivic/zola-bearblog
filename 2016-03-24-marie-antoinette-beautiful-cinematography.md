I'd forgotten just how beautiful the cinematography ((I must confess that I had to look up what the difference is, between a cinematographer and a photographer, and found it [here](http://global.britannica.com/topic/cinematography).)) for the film "_[Marie Antoinette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Antoinette_(2006_film))_" by Sofia Coppola is.

I even love the music. The part where the newly assigned king and queen walk out to The Cure's "_[Plainsong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkJwpYrcAko)_" is a splendorous example, even though I love how [The Radio Dept.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Radio_Dept.)'s music is spliced-in throughout the film.

And I love the part of the film where Marie Antoinette runs away from her duties and is just a regular teen. And another part of how she's trapped in her little bubble of regency while the people starve. And...and.

It's one of those films that stay with you, kind of like "_[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013)_" stays with me, always.

I popped by [Tvålpalatset](http://www.tvalpalatset.se) to eat a sandwich and have caffé latte and try out [Qik](http://qik.com) some more, so I hooked up to their wi-fi and filmed this from their anteroom:

Gotta love anybody who forces fish to live in the smallest place possible and then throws in a plastic croc to scare the shit out of them. I'll bet Oskar (who runs the café) was a WWII Camp Commendant in a previous life... ;-)

I told him about Qik just as [a professional photographer](http://www.alsterdal.nu) was snapping pictures of Oskar making a cappuccino. Entralled with knowing that Qik streams your film live to a site where people can comment your film in _real time_ and saves it for later viewing, Oskar ordered me to film him making a cappuccino. While I was doing this, said photographer snapped a multitude of pictures of me filming Oskar. Just there and then, my old acquaintance [Greven](http://www.greven.nu) showed up to order coffee, and is seen for appx. a millisecond before I stopped filming:

Oh, those electronic thingamajigs making our world just smaller and smaller!

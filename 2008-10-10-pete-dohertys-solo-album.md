**edit**: Pete's solo album is reviewed by me [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=2447).

Apparently Pete's in the studio hacking together what will become his debut solo album. In the mean-time, however, he's used his Mac to splice together bits of him in the studio, filming [Stephen Street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Street) and [Graham Coxon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Coxon) talking about history and playing music. A recommendable part of the Doherty-infused video is circa 2:05 after which he gets into his track "_1939 Returning_"; the lyrics follow:

> Tread carefully upon the drifting lights/When you're behind enemy lines/Caught behind enemy lines in 1939/For Germany he sacrificed his life

As he's posted notes on the album before, which have ranged from flat-out [erronous](http://www.nme.com/news/babyshambles/28051) to making people think [it'll never happen](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7444164.stm) and [a fucked video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUUNF-BkL1Y) of him and Graham Coxon playing the latter's sweet song "_You're So Great_".

Here's the the video I was referring to at the start of this post, and cheers to Pete if he should ever finish this project:

By visiting [a friend's site](http://www.mrsshankly.com/files/mp3week.html) today, I found [a very nice statement and picture of Mr. Moz](http://www.morrisseymusic.com/newsitem.asp?id=89) where the man urges people to vote for Jon Stewart, and at the same time, he writes that "Bush has single-handedly turned the United States into the most neurotic and terror-obsessed country on the planet". Oh, and Moz wears a "Jon Stewart for president" t-shirt.

[Here's a follow-up](http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2653047) on the film of Jon Stewart appearing on Crossfire, that [I posted earlier](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=344) this week. In that follow-up, Jon comments on his appearance and clarifies it (as if it needs that, really).

It all reminded me of Bill Hicks. People expected him to be funny - which he was - and still, he got his political, social-conscious, omniscient thoughts through. It's little wonder that people love him, as he spoke as if the people who listened to him were intelligent. Not a lot of purple-vein dick jokes there. Intelligence! Conscience! The truth mattered to him! God damn, [buy his DVD now](http://www.rykodisc-media.com/billhicks). Right now, I'll head on to back to watch it.

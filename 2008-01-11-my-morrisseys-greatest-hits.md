So, [Morrissey's issuing a "Greatest Hits"](http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_080110_01). Yes, another one. This one is fiercely into his two most recent albums. Here's the track-list:

> "First Of The Gang To Die" (UK #6, from You Are The Quarry) "In The Future When All's Well" (UK #17, from Ringleader Of The Tormentors) "I Just Want To See The Boy Happy" (UK #16, from Ringleader Of The Tormentors) "Irish Blood, English Heart" (UK #3, from You Are The Quarry) "You Have Killed Me" (UK #3, from Ringleader Of The Tormentors) "That's How People Grow Up" (new) "Everyday Is Like Sunday" (UK #9, from Viva Hate) "Redondo Beach" (UK #11, from Live At Earls Court) "Suedehead" (UK #5, from Viva Hate) "The Youngest Was The Most Loved" (UK #14, from Ringleader Of The Tormentors) "The Last Of The Famous International Playboys" (UK #6, from Bona Drag) "The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get" (UK #8, from Vauxhall And I) "All You Need Is Me" (new) "Let Me Kiss You" (UK #8, from You Are The Quarry) "I Have Forgiven Jesus" (UK #10, from You Are The Quarry)

I _know_ it says "greatest hits" - probably meaning sales-wise, apart from the two new tracks - but never the less, here's my own take, where I allow myself an album total of erhm, a few seconds more than 12 hours, 11 minutes:

"Lost" "It's Hard To Walk Tall When You're Small" "I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday" "Everyday Is Like Sunday" "I Can Have Both" "Late Night, Maudlin Street" "Good Looking Man About Town" "Jack The Ripper" \[from the live album _Beethoven Was Deaf_\] "The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get" "Trouble Loves Me" "In The Future When All's Well" "Now My Heart Is Full" "I Will See You In Far Off Places" "Sing Your Life" "You Know I Couldn't Last" "Interlude \[with Siouxsie Sioux\]" "America Is Not The World" "You're The One For Me, Fatty" "Hold On To Your Friends" "Sunny" "Piccadilly Palare" "The Operation" "The World Is Full Of Crashing Bores" "Boxers" "The Last Of The Famous International Playboys" "On The Streets I Ran" "Life Is A Pigsty" "To Me You Are A Work Of Art" "Speedway"

Some tracks are included merely for piecemeal reasons, e.g. "On The Streets I Ran", which I include first and foremost to display Morrissey's fantastic vocal performance - his _breadth_, my lord - and to stress how his voice has developed throughout his career, while others work wonders as a whole, e.g. "Speedway". It's impossible for me to compile a _Greatest Hits_ for what Morrissey's accomplished, so I really must stress that the above list is not definitive in any way. Disclaimers, disclaimers... **edit**: X's got [this post](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2008/01/11/mozzas-greatest-hits/) up on the subject.

Two of my fave covers that he's done:

Magazine's "A Song From Under The Floorboards" Raymonde's "No One Can Hold A Candle To You"

Here's a live video from the DVD "_Who Put The M In Manchester_" of the latter. Enjoy.

_I did warn you that this was going to be karaoke night._

Dressy Bessy's coming album, "Electrified", should be very good. The female lead vocalist reminds me a lot of [Kim Deal](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:2i68mps39f3o) from Pixies, which is a good thing. Loads of semi-false glissandos mixed with good indie guitars churning out good melodies has turned out a pretty good album.

Download this track, "[Who'd Stop The Rain](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009SBX36/002-8411964-1204849)", from their coming LP.

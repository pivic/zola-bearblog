When doing the washing up this morning, I had to clean stearic off a knife, having used it to rinse a candlestick. It was painful, because the candlestick was made of glass ((I hate the thought of getting shards inside of myself. It's phobic.)), and also because having to rub stearic off every tine in the knife.

Still, the knife and the candlestick were clean after the operation, and all was well.

A few moments before this, I saw Per Morberg on Swedish morning TV, talking about his latest cook book. For those of you who don't know who he is, he's a Swedish b-actor who's become noticed because of his Swedish cooking shows, where he sweats into his foods and kills animals, order undecided.

During the interview, Morberg constantly peered into the floor and explained his demeanour: he was ill and exhausted from signing his new book yesterday. Then, he suddenly flared and started tearing up. His explained this with "I saw the line of people who all wanted me to sign my book."

Close-ups of pictures from his book were displayed on the TV. His face had now lifted from the floor and he looked healthy.

"It was so beautiful. A tear may now be forming in my eye. Yes."

More pictures from his book were displayed. The interviewer spoke, but was interrupted by Morberg:

"I know that you just showed us this picture, but I have to show it here."

And so, he opened up a physical copy of his book and displayed two pages, to little joy and to confusion as to why he did this. His own words (about himself) had made him feel better.

As I wished for the interviewer to interrupt Morberg through rational thought and words and just expunge his shape from TV forever, it didn't happen; instead, a few minutes later, I found myself happier with the troublesome method of cleaning stearic off a knife. The knife is clean, but Morberg and TV4 leaves tarnish.

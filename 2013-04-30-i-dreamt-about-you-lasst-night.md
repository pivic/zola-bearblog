I actually dreamt last night. I mean, I remember it.

Our kitchen was tinted of "_[2001](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_%28film%29)_", all in glossy, dirty white. X was next to the kitchen table, dressed in neo-white; her outfit was from the waist down a flowy and tiered skirt from [Free People](http://www.freepeople.com); the upper part, however, was a mixture of plastic and leather, all [Hugo Boss SS regalia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Boss_%28fashion_designer%29). Very chic altogether. That's how it felt in the dream. Very nazi-cum-hippie. It felt wholesome. I can't think of a better word for how it felt - in my dream.

X pointed at a chopping block on the table. Two lines of vegetables lay on it. "The vegetables don't know", X whispered to me. It was obvious. They were about to undergo a [selection](http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/genocide/video.html;jsessionid=4D713B01CD1F27EB39DDADDB86879527).

I recall feeling terrified. At the same time, I somehow quickly accepted that the vegetables were to meet their fate. This was, somehow, predestined. Or rather, I could do nothing to stop it. I felt it didn't matter, even though I didn't want the vegetables to perish. Peering down at the chopping block, it was easy to see which vegetables were to be selected for extermination (i.e. would most probably go into our compost pile) or to live (i.e., ironically, become cooked and eaten by us).

X's maternal grandmother called. X picked up. She quickly spoke with her and then handed the phone to me. I spoke with an agitated grandmother, who asked me how they were supposed to transport their vegetables to us. I was startled. Why should any vegetables be brought here? I mean, I wasn't _against_ any kind of vegetable, I just didn't want them any harm, which I felt would befall them if they'd arrive here. X was by my side, clutching a butcher's knife. X's grandmother said "Do you want us to let them come by train, or walk, or?" I responded that, well, could you _drive_ the vegetables to us? "Why do you want us to drive them? They're too many!" and I thought, oh...

## My verdict

I'm fucking nuts.

Another way to spin this: this dream is one of the more lucid I've had in ages. I usually don't remember much of my dreams, and they're almost always in black-and-white. This one was in full colour, beyond faded technicolor, carrying a vapid lacquer throughout. I just wanted to escape, while wanting to save the vegetables. I also felt as though X was very calm and knew exactly what she was doing.

The more I think about the dream, the less I laugh at it - even though, at least to me, there are some really laughable elements to it - and the more I realise that yes, this shit actually went on during most of WW2. And people accepted it. And don't forget, most people who joined the nazi party did so _voluntarily_.

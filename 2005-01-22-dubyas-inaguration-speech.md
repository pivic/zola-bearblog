First of all, he's using so much from the bible, it's horrifying. And that bit about the freedom of the USA relying on the freedom in other countries, which means they'll create "freedom" anywhere they see fit? That, my friends, is pure bullshit. Use "imperalism" as the leading word here and you'll see where he's going. Of course "freedom" means "terrorism" and/or "overtaking governments and installing those we see fit, that will (of course) serve (under) us". Note: the word "freedom" was used appx. 25 times and the word "liberty" appx. 25 times also.

Also, a buddy tells me (rightfully so) that the name of Jesus was really Yeshua ben Yusef. Why not use that in the USA?

I also found [this](http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2663486) very lively film about the Bush inaguration ceremony. Synopsis:

> A Fox News anchor flips out when a guest dares to question the nature of Bush's elaborate 2nd inauguration.

The Fox anchor tries to get Bachrach (her guest) to comment how "lovely the White House looks" and Bachrach just completely **slays** the inaguration ceremony. To begin, she paints a quite vulgar picture of the image and asks how come the US troops in Iraq have to use metal shrapnel to try and cover the roof of their Humvees, as they're not getting any military fundings for it. That means they're very easy to bomb to death. Anyway, the inaguration ceremony is costing the American tax-payers _40 million US dollars_. See that film!

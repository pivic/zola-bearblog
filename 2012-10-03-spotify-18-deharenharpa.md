Despite the much-doubted power of Spotify, there is one track on this playlist that I have to share with you aside from the studio version found in the Spotify playlist. The very first time I heard [The Alan Parsons Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alan_Parsons_Project)'s ((...and I thought I'd never ever listen to them, judging from their band name, but there you go.)) "_[Eye In The Sky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_in_the_Sky_%28song%29)_" was on [Metronomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronomy)'s brilliant, mixed compilation that's part of the "[**Late Night Tales**](http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=11412)" series.

This version of their song is warmer, more dense, louder and slightly faster than the original. And the vengeful, stalker's lyrics delivered through a 1980s silky, flange-tinged rock voice provides a great contrast that modern pop songs seldom do, bar tracks such as [Super Furry Animals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Furry_Animals)' "[_No Sympathy_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_K2s2P6WGE)".

So, here's "_Eye In The Sky_" as on the Metronomy mix:

Hearing [Glenn Gould](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Gould)'s playing on the soundtrack for the film "**[Shame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame_%282011_film%29)**", hearing his voice muttering to the clanks of ivory keys - it reminds me of walking. And I often start my days at work with listening to Gould's collection named "**[Images](http://www.glenngould.com/us/music/images-glenn-gould)**". Strangely enough, hearing his playing Bach reminds me of Judah Bauer's guitar playing in [The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Spencer_Blues_Explosion). Equal parts simplicity with personality, emotion with restraint. Two sides of the same cup. ((What fucking eloquency.))

Two Gallants have been missed on me from several years ago, when a certain Viktor Elm recommended them to me. Thanks, Viktor. I've finally got the gist. Two Gallants' new album is good, and the first track here is no exception. What a self-executing voice the singer has.

Blu & Exile's track is from a really good hip-hop album, "**[Give Me My Flowers While I Can Still Smell Them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_Me_My_Flowers_While_I_Can_Smell_Them)**".

[Hammock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammock_%28band%29) feels like [Sigur Rà³s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigur_R%C3%B3s) combined with [Explosions In The Sky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosions_in_the_Sky). Their track feels like a great ending to this one.

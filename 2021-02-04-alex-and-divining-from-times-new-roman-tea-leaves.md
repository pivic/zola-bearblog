I was just listening to the episode 'Jet-setters' on the ill-named _Darknet Diaries_ podcast, when a hacker named ["Alex"](https://mango.pdf.zone/) (the quotation marks are actually included in his name) [says the following](https://pca.st/2qll188h#t=1169), the last sentence of which made me howl:

> So, I was kind of just googling it, being like: Hey, what are the laws, can I read them? And, it turns out, there is: there's this thing called the legislation, and it's just the laws, written down. And, I had no problem scrolling through and reading all the HTML of that page, but whoever wrote the legislation was just making up words. There is just so many complicated words, and it's so not obvious what they mean. But I was eventually able to _divine_ from the Times New Roman tea leaves that having the passport number shouldn't be a crime.

Hacking is a bit like being a Technical Writer, really.

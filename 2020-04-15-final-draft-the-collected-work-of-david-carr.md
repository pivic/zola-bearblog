I'm not gonna say a thing other than proclaim that David Carr was a fucking ace. He wrote like few others.

You can [select this](https://niklasblog.com/?s=david+carr) to find other shit that I've written about Carr but [this](https://niklasblog.com/?p=23030) is the best starting point.

There's a brand-new book out named _Final Draft: The Collected Work of David Carr_ that I'm going to read once I get through a mountain of stuff that I'm currently reading, notably _[Becoming Beauvoir: A Life](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/24/becoming-beabuvoir-by-kate-kirkpatrick)_ by Kate Kirkpatrick.

The quote above is by Ta-Nehisi Coates who wrote the introduction to this new book that contains Carr's writing. [Here](https://lithub.com/ta-nehisi-coates-on-the-privilege-of-knowing-david-carr/)'s an article that contains said quote.

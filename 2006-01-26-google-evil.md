Oh yeah, now Google is really shaping up to become a force of evil. From [this good article off Good Morning Silicon Valley](http://blogs.siliconvalley.com/gmsv/2006/01/its_like_watchi.html):

> Apparently you can scratch "censorship in pursuit of profit" off your list of Things That Are Evil. On Wednesday, Google plans to roll out google.cn, a version of its search service custom tailored to the specs of the Chinese government and designed to reach China's 100 million Web surfers without returning counterrevolutionary results for searches on, say, Taiwan or Tiananmen.

How very fitting, considering I saw Kurosawa's "[Throne of Blood](http://criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=190)" yesterday evening. Fucking bastards Google.

No, there is no contest apart from [Microsoft censoring Chinese as well](https://niklasblog.com/?p=853), but I'd give anything to hear what the marketing people at Google are getting together to support this:

\- Hey Robert, what d'ya reckon we can hit the masses with, getting them to believe we're really good, when we're now officially supporting a dictator-run oppressionist state? - Let's just say we're doing it for the sake of Liberty and Democracy! Worked for Dubya, didn't it? - Oh yeah, let's!

Bill Hicks spins fifty laps in his fucking grave.

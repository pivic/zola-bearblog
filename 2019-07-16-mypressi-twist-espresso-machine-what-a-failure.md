What I started out with; the espresso machine, a Hario coffee grinder, a water boiler, and a tamper.

This morning I thought I'd give a gift a try: I've been handed a [MyPressi TWIST espresso maker](https://mypressi.com), so I used it for the first time.

As you see, it's quite a simple design.

The entire "ball" part of the machine can be separated; the top half (seen to the right in the picture above) has boiling water poured into it, and the second half has ground coffee put in it.

The handle of the machine has space for a carbon-dioxide cartridge. When the trigger is pulled, carbon dioxide flows through the handle into the top part of the ball where hot water is. The more carbon dioxide, the more pressure builds. The pressure should push water through the coffee and subsequently the metal filter into the cup.

That's not what happened:

Apart from producing a snakey sound, nothing much happened at all.

I thought I'd either tamped the coffee too hard—making it impenetrable for the water—or just used too much coffee.

I wasted an entire cartridge on that load, ending up with _no_ liquidised coffee, and loads of curse words spewed everywhere.

So, I redid it. Tamped far less, used less than half the coffee required.

The results? A cup of coffee that would barely touch the top of a thimble. The results tasted nicely, but that's because the coffee's so good.

Anyway, in the end, is the machine worth it?

No.

It weighs about three pounds—or so it feels like—so I'll stick with my [AeroPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroPress).

P.S. I'm sure that there are ways to get it to work as well as it has:

There was only one really bizarre call yesterday. Here's how it went down:

me: IT-department, Niklas speaking. person: Oh yes, hello, my name is X and I'm calling from home. I'm trying to reach my webmail but it's not working. m: I see; exactly how is it not working - can you log into the service? p: No, the password isn't working.

After a bit of trouble-shooting, the person interrupts me.

p: Oh, sorry for interrupting you, but...should I use my current password to log in? m: Oh yes indeed, you should always use your current password. p: Oh! I was using the old one! Shouldn't I use that one instead? m \[...\] No, try using your current one. That's the way, always use the current password, and just discard the old one. p: Oh, thank you! m: No problem. Thank you for calling, good-bye. p: Good-bye!

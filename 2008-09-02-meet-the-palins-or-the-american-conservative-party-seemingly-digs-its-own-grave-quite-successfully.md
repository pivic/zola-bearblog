![The Palins. No, not the Michael Palins.](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-09-02-palins.jpg)As the American election is coming, the presidential candidates have picked their vice presidents to be. As usual, I think the conservatives are more interesting than the democrats, as they fling the most poo while claiming the very highest high ground, triumphantly backed by hearsay and symbolic truthiness in the shape of a baked product; of course I'm referring to christianity and American, American apple pie.

So, John McCain, the conservative candidate, _must_ have gone through his litter of to-be vice presidents using an array of spies and FBI/CIA/NSA information before choosing Alaskan governor Sarah Palin as his sidekick, right? He wouldn't want anything like [the Thomas Eagleton scandal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McGovern#Eagleton_controversy) on his hands.

Before I verbally impale the American conservatives by use of a single-line bitchslap, here's the background information you should know before I pass the pill: Sarah Palin is christian. This means that she should worship a scientifically unproven so-called God, but more importantly, that she should do everything holy and tidy as written in a slightly contradictory step-by-step manual called _the bible_. This book is to be believed word by word, unless you are anti-christian. If you are one of those, you are to be called upon by christians, who will kill you if you feel need for any other god(s); that's from Deuteronomy 13:7-11, which I have quoted [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1014#identifier_1_1014).

I don't know how somebody in McCain's ranks missed the following regarding Palin and her family, but [as The Guardian puts it](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/02/uselections2008.republicans20084):

> \[...\] her 17-year-old unmarried daughter, Bristol, is five months pregnant.

That settles that, then. Sarah Palin is to murder her daughter. After that, she can be redeemed though saying a few Hail Marys and then go home.

If it weren't for the fact that a majority - bar [the coup d'etat](https://niklasblog.com/?p=268) a while back - most recently voted for Dubya to stay in The White House, I cannot see how Barack Obama _can_ lose. Please, America, see to it that he wins.

**edit**: thanks to [Kuba](http://lotophagous.com), I now know someecards say it all:

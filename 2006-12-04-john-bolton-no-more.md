[![John Bolton, assmaster](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-12-boltonthumb.jpg)](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-12-bolton5.jpg)John Bolton, a.k.a. the US ambassador in the UN, is kicked out of there. [I've written about him before](https://niklasblog.com/?p=521), and everything and everybody knows I hate him, so you can just guess how happy I am now that [he's leaving](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6207054.stm) the UN!

_Finally_, effing Jesus-tapdancing-Chryst.

Of course, two more factors are in play here:

**1**. Dubya's government might choose somebody new who's even worse than Bolton. Consider Rumsfeld a valid option, given Bolton's skills for the job. Or Hitler's brain, kind of like what happens [in Futurama](http://www.gotfuturama.com/Information/Encyc-44-Richard_Nixons_Head). **2**. This is a part of Operation Smiles, where Dubya wants to get rid of those near him who tarnish his unblemished somewhat unreliable image ... rid of people who make _him_ (and, of course, his government) look bad.

So, what does The White House say about this? From the mouth of their spokesperson:

> The president appointed ambassador Bolton because he knew he would represent America's values and would take head-on problems at the United Nations

Is "America's values" [this](http://www.niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-12-bolton3.jpg)? C'mon, America! You can do it - [other have](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_October_Overthrow)!

When I was smaller I read "_[Last Chance To See](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Chance_to_See)_", by Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine. It features their trips around the globe to see animals on the very brink of extinction - and by this I mean creatures that are very few in numbers. It made me intensely sad, but at the same time really wary of how I could help endangered animals, e.g. through donating money.

One type of very endangered animal that Adams/Carwardine wrote about is the [Kakapo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo). This is the biggest parrot in the world, and is completely unable to fly. An interesting and weird thing about the males, is that they emit a very loud, heart-beat-like sound repetitively when they want to attract female kakapi ((From [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo#Reproduction).)):

> To attract females, males make loud, low-frequency (below 100 Hz) booming calls from their bowls by inflating a thoracic sac. They start with low grunts, which increase in volume as the sac inflates.

This sound can travel up to 5 kilometers ((Translates as 3 miles, for those of you not prone to dig the metric system.)). Boom.

Having read said book I immediately contacted two Kakapo preservation societies, who were both terrific and sent me loads of pictures, info and other stuff. I was elated. I'd fallen in love with a big bird, and still, whenever I see a picture or a video of this bird, I'm happy.

Even though cat control (!) has helped in strengthening the number of kakapi ((In 1986 there were 22 kakapi alive; today, that number is 125; as found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo#Kakapo_recovery_plan).)), they still need help. You can help out through [The Kakapo Recovery Programme](http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz), and you'll find their donations page [here](http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=112&Itemid=225).

Here's a little film of a kakapo.

Sweet! [Erik Benson](http://43.allconsuming.net/person/erik), the creator of [All Consuming](http://43.allconsuming.net), a site that enables its users to register what different kinds of media she/he devours at the moment, [has sold it to the company he works for](http://43.allconsuming.net/account/erik_letter), which in turn makes [43 Things](http://www.43things.com), a very good online to-do list.

The old All Consuming site was slow, and hence my site was slow to load in its entirety. Now that my consuming list loads quickly, so does the entire first page of my site. Geekishly sweet. _Finally_ there's a great way to note you're finished with consuming an item on All Consuming. Yeay!

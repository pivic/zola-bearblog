[![Left vs Bank](http://static.flickr.com/50/138492866_64783dbb5d_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=138492866)[Rade](http://static.flickr.com/23/30070718_4ee4e90ae4.jpg "Muuuud!") came over this week-end, and what a week-end it's been. Loads of partying, and I can't actually be bothered with writing about it all. The best part was seeing Boban Markovic Orkestar live, which rocked everything. Check [this flash-film](http://www.vimeo.com/clip:68777) just to see a tad of what it was like. We're talking massive love, dancing throughout the night and people having a super time. If you ever get the chance, see that band.

Yesterday I went out protesting, as the day was Labour Day! I joined [Jesper and Marie](http://static.flickr.com/52/138490893_5d793473fb.jpg "The family!") in the Left Party's protest-walk from Slussen to Kungsträdgården. The road was filled with protesters, and everything was calm except for a few motorists who were caught in the people-cade.

I'm so tired from having slept badly, but I just want to post a few links.

Dirty Pretty Things are [hailed some by The Guardian](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1762413,00.html). By the way, [here](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1758717,00.html)'s an interview they did with Carl Barât.

While on music, it's good to see [Neil Young's getting political](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1764560,00.html), almost like [Zappa](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/04/26/frank_zappas_anticen.html). Just like Robert Greenwald and his people who are trying to have "[Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers](http://iraqforsale.org)" made, a documentary that will (hopefully) unveil the endless capitalistic fucks who are trying to set Iraq up for their divide-and-plunder-schemes. [Check the site out](http://iraqforsale.org), and donate to have it made! Or [become a republican](http://www.thefrown.com/frowners/becomerepublican.swf). Speaking of which, Steven Colbert seems to have kicked Dubya's ass at a little "roast" [recently](http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2006/04/stephen_colbert_2.html). Download the entire film [here](http://www.mininova.org/tor/296239).

[![Anti-alcoholic](http://static.flickr.com/45/138494614_aded775c02_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=138494614) While on the subject of pirates, why not [get a legit anti-virus-application for your portable device](http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/antivirus/portable_clamwin)? Or install [this Firefox-extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2390) to download streamed films off the Internet?

Or you could [install Internet Explorer 7 without really installing over IE 6](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/04/test-internet-explorer-7-without.html); throw some [IE add-ons](http://www.ieaddons.com) into it.

Or...you should go to sleep, like I soon will.

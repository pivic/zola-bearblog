I love hearing "_[Strange Currencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB2A3c6ZlSo)_" by R.E.M., playing over the images of this trailer, which is for "The End Of The Tour", a film created from [David Lipsky's book named "_Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: A Road Trip with David Foster Wallace_"](https://niklasblog.com/?p=14903), a book written by Lipsky, a writer for Rolling Stone Magazine, who hung around David Foster Wallace during a leg of his reading tour of “Infinite Jest”, by many considered to be Wallace's masterpiece ((Which isn't true; "The Pale King" is, I not-so-humbly say.))

I'm afraid for the film to be a hagiography, but it actually looks good. The quotes from Wallace are lovely, but he was that way, he was always relevant.

I've been to the abandoned mental hospital in Beckomberga with X and snapped many a picture. So here you go!

The way that she carries her new jacket does wonders for its reputation.

At first we thought we wouldn't find anything at Beckomberga to shout about, as loads of territory had been tractored out of existence to make way for new apartments and other stuff. I guess nobody's thinking about the people who love finding abandoned places! Grr!

I've since long been such an opponent to faded pics. I've often [contrasted the hell out of my pics](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/1423741727) but I'm getting more and more into fading them.

As proven.

Lame mini-confession: I first thought this was a guy with some weird samurai knot out of the back of his head with some red..._beads_!? coming out. Not quite.

The above two feel like the scariest pics from the bunch but when being there, they just felt pretty and safe. It's like when you know somebody's hurting or feeling bad and you know you prefer that to any polished surface where somebody's really just acting. So that room felt good.

Seeing Putin's face up close in the above pic it felt like he was being victimised by the exclamation mark and the question mark. Really though, we all know he's not a victim in the least. Right? !

Always remember.

I choose to think that this is the result of kids wanting to be all verboten and wild out rather than real nazis having done that.

I pointed this window out to X who responded by naturally gravitating towards it, and it seemed as though she _had_ to photograph it. I love seeing that happen! You just can't help yourself; you have to dance, you have to freak out, you have to take pictures.

Nature invited.

Etching stuff into walls is OK when the Surface is abandoned. Especially when funny.

Selfie time. I've not been doing much of that either, but...

...I prefer it with others. And I shouldn't try to tell you how much I like snapping those shots with this girl as I like seeing her with me, but seeing her paws surround me like this made me feel, yeah, as I look. This is just before my smirk evolved to a full-blown smile.

The above two pics remind me of Krakow.

The day was truly lovely, warm and sweet.

The very end of that video—from approximately 03:00 in—shouts _hold up_, in a very respectful and frank way. I wish to have that frame of mind.

The above meet partly resulted in this article, by Carr:

Carr's way of punching his poor computer is just wonderful; I laughed when I saw this video yesterday, for the first time in a few years, as I remembered Erin Lee Carr's _[All that You Leave Behind](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711352423/a-daughter-reflects-on-her-dads-ongoing-influence-in-all-that-you-leave-behind)_.

That book, by her, is stupefyingly good. Her dad wrote _[The Night of the Gun](https://niklasblog.com/?p=13830)_, which is a marvellous autobiography, mainly about his drug abuse, but also about his parenthood and other kinds of relationships.

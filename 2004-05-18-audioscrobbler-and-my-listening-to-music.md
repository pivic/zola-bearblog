I've recently found Audioscrobbler, a site that does the following and [more](http://www.audioscrobbler.com/about.php):

> Audioscrobbler is a computer system that builds up a detailed profile of your musical taste. After installing an Audioscrobbler Plugin, your computer sends the name of every song you play to the Audioscrobbler Server. With this information, the Audioscrobbler server builds you a 'Musical Profile'. Statistics from your Musical Profile are shown on your Audioscrobbler User Page, available for everyone to view.

I don't think it's snapping up all the songs I'm listening to, it seems to miss a few bits. Never the less, I'm using it, and my profile's now available from the top of the right-upper-corner part.

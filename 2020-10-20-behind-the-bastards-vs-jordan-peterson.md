The podcast Behind the Bastards have just released their first episode on Jordan Peterson. You can stream it from anywhere including here:

Part One: The Jordan Peterson Episode, Tuesday 20 October 2020, [https://www.behindthebastards.com](https://www.behindthebastards.com)

I've just heard it and I'm still slightly stunned. I mean, there's a lot to Peterson's grift and anti-intellectual stances—and I still think [this article says everything about him](https://niklasblog.com/?p=24374), intellectually speaking—but to hear some bright people talk about a script about Peterson is something else.

I think there'll be one more episode; Even though Peterson has produced and spawned a lot of insanity, it should be contained, mainly for the sake of his audience.

**Edit, 2020-10-22**: a second episode is now out! Here it is:

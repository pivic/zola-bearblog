Wiz Khalifa first on the opposite stage, wonderful. So animated and fun! The songs were perfect live.

At the end of his gig, Pulp's stage was completely covered in black tarp. Then Jarvis' voice saying he couldn't see us.

I cried during "_This Is Hardcore_", that's how things were during Pulp's gig at Way Out West.

One of the best lyricist in pop, ever, backed by most of the old band.

Did "_Joyriders_" after Jarvis talked about how "you might have heard about some trouble in London".

A strange man hugged me. All connected.

And "_Common People_" ended a total, magical evening which to me was not in the slightest about nostalgia.

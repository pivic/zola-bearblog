This is a beautiful biography of Jean-Michel Basquiat, one of my favourite artists.

Parisi has used key colours in wondrous ways to wander throughout Basquiat's life, as told through the voices of his father, a former agent, a former lover, and others. His life is told in a jazzy, free-flowing sensibility that, to me, perfectly matches Basquiat's life and art.

Aspects of Basquiat's life that are perhaps not very attractive, for example his vanity, drug abuse, and flip ways, are on display in ways that are just as well put as the rest of this book is.

The colours sting, in a great way, while Parisi's style of writing and storytelling is just as beautiful as his drawing and painting.

This is one of the best biographical graphic novels that I've ever had the pleasure to read.

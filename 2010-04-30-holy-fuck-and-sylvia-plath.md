> I lay my ear to furious Latin. I am not a Caesar. I have simply ordered a box of maniacs. They can be sent back. They can die, I need feed them nothing, I am the owner.
> 
> I wonder how hungry they are. I wonder if they would forget me If I just undid the locks and stood back and turned into a tree.

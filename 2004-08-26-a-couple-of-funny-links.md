[Here](http://www.bigjohntoiletseat.com)'s a link to a toilet seat that's custom made for fat people.

If you're Swedish, check out [this](http://www.avigsidan.com/avigsidan/cpict/kassa_konsulter.gif) interesting recruitment ad.

[Quentin Tarantino's blog](http://qtdiary.blogspot.com) is quite interesting. I think he shows a nice bit of spite and resentment of the whole industry, in a nice way. And he's looking forward to casting [Adam Sandler](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001191) in the lead role in his coming film, "[Inglorious Bastards](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748)".

I haven't been writing much as I've just started work again, but it's coming this week, I assure you.

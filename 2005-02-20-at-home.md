![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-02-20-lunch.gif)I'm so lazy. I couldn't even be compared with my friend Kristin, who's probably the laziest (internet-wise, that is) person I know, even though I'm lazy in real life. In real life. That's why I'm writing this, so I won't have to deal with real life. Oh, I could life as a couch potatoe for a while, actually. And I have! Really though, I love to get out and move, but I've just been really drowsy since the hang-over that lasted an entire day.

Yesterday Frederic came by and we watched "[Shooting Fish](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120122)". I haven't seen it since it featured at the cinema, and it's still good. It's a loveable film (although we all loathed Kate Beckinsale's character to various degrees) and has a [great soundtrack](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120122/soundtrack). We then just sat and talked, watching various clips from Saturday Night Live, mostly sporting Chris Kattan and Christopher Walken.

Oh, we're broke. We don't have any money until the 25th, which is when most Swedes get their pay-checks, and so do we (at least this month). Hence I ate a yoghurt-with-cereal-lunch, actually very nice and good, even though it may look spartan in flavour. Well, we're not as bad off as things may seem; this morning I had some very nice loaves of "Danish bread" from Rivalbageriet with some of Mikaela's delicious hummus.

Aw, Mikaela just came home, having shopped loads of necessities for our nest. I'm just a spoiled brat. Have you ever thought otherwise?

Oh, by no way, [here](http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,605600,00.html)'s a Swedish article on a man from the Netherlands, who killed, skinned and wore his mother. That's lerv for you.

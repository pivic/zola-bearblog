I just saw this video:

This video displays how fear cannot handle love.

The atmosphere is undeniable: this is how police, driven by fascism, tries to silence voices; this is probably illegal in the USA.

I empathise more with rioters than with this type of police.

Help with funding the Charleston protesters:

Somehow, the Charleston Police Department—which has [partly published its Racial Bias Audit upside-down](https://www.charleston-sc.gov/DocumentCenter/View/23498/CNA-Contract)—need to respond to the video posted above.

I just hope that the police involved in this are tried for the obviously criminal offence that they have committed.

**Bonus**: interactive map displaying where police have killed people in the USA. Note the interactive slider at the bottom part of the map.

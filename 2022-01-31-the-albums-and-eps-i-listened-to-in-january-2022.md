- **Robin Guthrie** - Springtime Nice EP, but not as good as his [Riviera](https://robinguthrie.bandcamp.com/album/riviera) EP, which was released in December 2021.

- **Vlada Divljan & Ljetno Kino** - [Live@ Tvornica Kulture](https://www.discogs.com/release/6735303-Vlada-Divljan-Ljetno-Kino-LiveTvornica-Kulture) If The Libertines were from Serbia, this would be it
    

- **Anna von Hausswolff** - [Live at Montreux Jazz Festival](https://annavonhausswolffsl.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-montreux-jazz-festival)

haven't been interested in her music before this album, a darkened, moody, and thoroughly well-composed pack of songs played live. Imagine goth patchouli.

- **Tanya Tagaq** - [Teeth Agape](https://sixshooterrecords.com/artists/tanya-tagaq/) This is one of the few times that I've been pleasantly surprised by what a streaming-service algorithm has provided. This is a few different styles meshed into one.

- **Carter Burwell** - [The Tragedy of Macbeth](http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Macbeth.shtml) Burwell's soundtrack for 'Fargo' is one of my favourite soundtracks: it makes the film better. This soundtrack is not as good, but fairly interesting. I don't remember any of it, bar actor monologues from the film that have been plopped in. 'Is this a dagger I see before me?' asks Denzel Washington. Cue strings.

- **TV Victor** - [GRV Vol. 3](https://tresorberlin.bandcamp.com/album/grv-vol-3) This is from Tresor, the music label that is also the best techno club that I've ever visited. This is a really interesting collection of tracks, all worthwhile.

- **Bonobo** - [Fragments](https://bonobomusic.bandcamp.com/album/fragments) This is a simple and straightforward electronic album that brings me back to the late 1990s, when trip-hop dominated the lists. This is not memorable, but somehow I don't dislike it.
    

- **Herbert** - [Musca](https://matthewherbert.bandcamp.com/album/musca) Matthew Herbert has a fairly simple style of making house. It's as though somebody's used Masters of Sound-ish music to augment Mike Pickering's stuff. Nerdy of me, I know.

- **Vromm** - [Decentralized](https://cosmicbridgerecs.com/track/vromm-decentralized) A bit too trite for my taste, but OK to have in the background, lacking better music. That's an awful opinion to have of an album.

- **Eels** - [Extreme Witchcraft](https://eelstheband.com/extreme_witchcraft/) The last album was full of strings and other instruments. Now, not so. This is the guitar and simple songs, rock that's free, songs that are well-written, and this one deserves more listens.

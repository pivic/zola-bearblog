This book shows off the art from the _Hellboy_ motion picture that is released in 2019. The spectacular computer-made imagery is paired with small pieces of text that explain the characters, while everything is chronologically explained.

The film draws inspiration from Hellboy's origin story and also from later instances. Some art from a scene that was cut from the movie is displayed and also one easter egg.

Other than that: I missed a lot of personality in this book; where's the animus and atmosphere? I'd love to have seen more of that, while capturing, perhaps, some explanations for some of the artistic decisions behind all of it. I'd like to have seen that.

I must say, the one thing that tiffed me off was Hellboy's apartment:

He has one Jesus and Mary Chain poster, one The Cramps poster, and then a later-day _Green Day poster_? Man. That _is_ Hell.

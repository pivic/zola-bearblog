There's not much to say about this relatively short Spotify collaborative playlist; 47,7 minutes of glee.

Apart from the first, growing, monumental track. I saw [MONO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono%20%28Japanese%20band%29) last year at All Tomorrow's Parties, where three boys stood thrusting themselves back and forth while playing guitars wearing all-white clothes that flowed. They looked funny, but the album where this song's from is really good and produced by [Steve Albini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve%20albini) which should amount for something.

[Death In Vegas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death%20in%20Vegas) is a weird sort of collabo-band for me. They've worked with people like Iggy Pop, the Primals and other notables, but there's something about this track where Paul Weller's guest vocalist. Twanging Austin Powers-type pop but still not. I think it's the guitar that sounds like a sitar in combination with the strings that does it for me.

[Speech Debelle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech%20Debelle) won this year's Mercury Prize. Even though I usually don't like her style - and I definitely don't like her award-winning album - there's something in here that attracts me. Could be the Stereo MC's similies, or just her voice working it out. Anybody rapping about Facebook should be banned but then again there's something about this that I like; just like the last song I mentioned. Hm.

I was tipped about this track by [The Skids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Skids), but I've got to admit that beyond the quite badly produced music there's a voice that is kind of a mix of [Joey Ramone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey%20Ramone) and [Pete Shelley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete%20Shelley). It's released in 1979. _Intoooo the vaaalleeeeey_.

[Giorgio Moroder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio%20Moroder)'s song "_The Chase_" is featured in the film "_[Midnight Express](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight%20Express%20%28film%29)_". When I was quite little I saw this film and became intensely scared of Turkey. Back then, I had quite a few friends who were from Turkey and I remember asking a few of them if things were as grim as they seemed and they told me Turkey was all beaches and sun and that the film was "propaganda shit" without having seen them. I wonder if that way of reasoning differs at all from the Turkish government of today...

> Jeane There's ice on the sink where we bathe So how can you call this a home When you know it's a grave?

And there's nothing more to say.

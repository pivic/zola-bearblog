Isn't this a hoot? An American lawyer (if he is one) has threatened the registered owner of [The Pirate Bay](http://thepiratebay.com) with words. When he failed at international law, he posted a MS Word-document (over 1MB in original size - but don't worry, my URL leads to a flash version only 75KB big) portraying Fredrik in a queasy situation. Check my version [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-05-28.html).

I understand the law coming after TPB, but they can't win, yet. Check other of the legal threats they've received, [here](http://static.thepiratebay.org/legal).

A colleague is looking for a new bag, and I've helped him look. If I were to buy a new one, in spite of having a very nice [Marimekko](http://www.marimekko.fi) bag that Mikaela has given me, I would without a doubt go for [Freitag](http://www.freitag.ch/shop/megaframe-eu.htm), a company that makes great bags and have what's probably the worst web site ever. To have a somewhat pleasurable navigating experience at their site, click the Freitag link above and click "Come in, we're open". There you have it! Their business thing is to cut portions out of used truck trailer covers, i.e. the thick plastic, and then make bags out of it. The latest gizmo of theirs is a way to let people cut parts out of truck-covers themselves, via a little web interface. Check it out [here](http://www.freitag.ch/index_frames.php) - click "F-cut".

My colleague is more into [this one](http://www.chromebags.com/sling.php), "Sling" by Chrome. I think it's too shiny for me, too drab. Vexed Generation used to make nice bags, but it seems [they've become boring, too](http://www.karrysafe.com/home.html).

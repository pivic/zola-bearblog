As our old little 2X" TV is falling to pieces, we're thinking of buying a new one. I just saw this one, a [Panasonic TX-32PS11](http://www.panasonic.se/servlet/PB/menu/1008939/index.html) for a fairly cheap price. It's a 100Hz, 32" wide-screen TV, which should suit all our future TV needs perfectly. I'm just trying to find a bench for it as well.

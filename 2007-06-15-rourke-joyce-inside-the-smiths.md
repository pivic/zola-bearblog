Apparently, Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce are telling their own story on [The Smiths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smiths). On DVD. From [SuicideGirls](http://suicidegirls.com/news/music/21652):

> Directed by longtime fan, friend and pub proprietor Stephen Petricco, the documentary features commentary from the Fall's Mark E. Smith, New Order's Peter Hook, Buzzcocks' Pete Shelley, Kaiser Chiefs' Ricky Wilson and Nick Hodgson. There's also the obligatory rare footage and anecdotes about sex, drugs and life with Morrissey (who hates all those fun things).

The DVD drops 2007-07-16.

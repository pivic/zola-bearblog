I recently found a book that's available online, which is all about [Vincent van Gogh](http://www.vangoghgallery.com):

I've loved van Gogh's work for a very long time. When I was little I remember visiting the local library, looking through books with painters and while I was amazed by the images that washed over me and could spend hours in a closed room just gazing over it all, van Gogh was the one that truly stayed with me. I read a book about him and was entralled: his portraits of people, his mental illness, his [time in Arles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh#Move_to_Arles_.281888.E2.80.931889.29) and how that affected him, his early copies of existing artworks and how they contained his touches, [his relation with Gauguin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh), [his realistic painting turning impressionistic](http://www.vangoghgallery.com/painting/beforeafter.html)...

I think I found van Gogh at the same time that I found [Rimbaud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rimbaud), which was a double godsend, in a way. Impressionable, young and hungry for all kinds of shit, I lapped all of that up; I needed it. And van Gogh's wild colours and choice of objects, scenery, people...it could so easily have become boring but somehow wasn't! I didn't care about why, but I loved it and just wanted more. I really recommend his work, and there's so much of it; some think he was manic as he produced so much, but anyway, I'm just glad he did.

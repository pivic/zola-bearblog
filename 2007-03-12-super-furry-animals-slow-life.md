Where to start? [Super Furry Animals](http://superfurry.com) is one of my absolute favourite bands. To say they make interesting music is like saying [Noam Chomsky](http://www.chomsky.info) is a fairly intelligent old man. Wraaah! They blow my mind and have been known to cause me indirect physical damage when played in clubs. Even when they bore me they say more than most bands, and with that I'm not counting the stuff that's played on radio and TV but says naught about anybody's life. They are known to play clips of [Bill Hicks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hicks)' routines before going on stage. They own a tank. Few other bands have taken [Hunter S. Thompson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson)'s notion of [gonzo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson#Birth_of_Gonzo) further. They're funny and bring politics to the table sometimes. They give friends money to make their videos. And they're never afraid to say [fuck you to corporations](https://niklasblog.com/?p=820). Eclectic, yes. Eloquent, yes. Exciting, always.

Two good SFA-sites: [this fan-made one](http://superfurry.org) and [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/superfurryanimals) Welsh BBC-minisite.

I won't digress further. Just listen to this track and dare tell me they're no good. Or...to make it simple, they're as good as [Zell Miller is fucking crazy](http://suicidegirls.com/news/politics/20605). And they probably carry less drugs in to Sweden than [Snoop Dogg](http://zakdaddys.blogspot.com/2007/03/snoopless-snoop-aftershow-party.html).

By the way, it shows our fridge/freezer is today showing perfect temperatures. It just needed a little time to get all fridged out. [Here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-30-fridgefreezer.mov)'s a 30-second-long film \[MOV\] displaying its "features".

Yesterday Mikaela and I went to Frederic's place, where we met his good friend Finn, who's really nice. As he's blind, we of course made jokes about handicapped people during the evening. Anyway we had a gin and tonic, and then left for [Patricia](http://www.patricia.st), which, by 21:00, already was full. People kept pouring in though, just like our drinks. I also met Hans, an old comrade, whom I hadn't met for a long while. He was there with one of his friends, Lena. Anyway, I went back to my friends and had a lot of laughs and fun, but the morning after was NOT to be trifled with! I woke up with watching Mikaela emerge from the bathroom, moaning loudly, staggering through the bedroom door, toppling over a small wash basin and fainting. I was too recently awakened to do anything, so she fell backwards, hitting her head into a chair right next to the bed. She woke up a few seconds later, from my slapping her semi-gently in the face, asking her what she thought she was doing (as I wrote, I had just awakened). Poor Mikaela! \[update 2004-08-01: her head is a lot better off; the bump has receded from looking like Hindenburg to something resembling the remains after that ship burned and crashed - she'll be fine in a week, methinks).

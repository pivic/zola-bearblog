As I've recently become interested in very good listening equipment, mostly due to the fact I nearly blew my ear-drums out while testing my POD_xt_, I've stumbled across [Peter's guide](http://tesugen.com/archives/04/08/kopa-lurar) \[Swedish\] to his purchasing new head-phones and I am thinking of getting myself the [Sennheiser PXC 250](http://www.sennheiser.com/sennheiser/icm_eng.nsf/root/04924). It contains the so-called [NoiseGard technology](http://www.sennheiser.com/noisegard/noisegard/index_e.html) which sorts out any pesky background noise, yet I want to try it out before I believe in it, no matter that mags have given that function an excellent grade. The downfall with this, is that there's a battery holder needed to power that functionality, and 2 batteries at that. I'm not going to purchase head-phones this year, maybe within the next, but I'll just see what happens.

[The BBC are reporting](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4557877.stm) of a few things Chris Martin, singer in Coldplay, has said about EMI and its shareholders:

> Shareholders are the great evil of this modern world.

That's the way! Additionally, from the same article:

> EMI issued a profit warning in February partly because the release of the UK band's latest album X&Y was delayed. But Coldplay frontman Martin said: "I don't really care about EMI. I'm not really concerned about that." He spoke about the "the slavery that we are all under to shareholders" ahead of the album's release in early June.

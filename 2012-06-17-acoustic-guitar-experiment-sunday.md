Sunday. Lazy. Just woke up and was frantic because I'd previously woken up with X as her alarm clock went off. Second time I woke up it was 9 am and she was already at work. What a feeling! Horrible, somehow.

So I got up, got a shower, made coffee and breakfast, felt calm again. And picked up an acoustic guitar and played the above ditty into [Tapemachine](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samalyse.tapemachine).

I don't know how it came into my mind, but it's based on a melody I actually had in my mind 18 years (!) ago, about the time I first started playing my own little compositions.

Note to self: always note, never forget.

[![Ego Woman](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1301302164m/10894834.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10894834-ego-woman)[Ego Woman](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10894834-ego-woman) by [Carolina Gynning](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4722106.Carolina_Gynning)  
My rating: [1 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/157199862)  
  
One of the worst books I've ever read. It's true.  
  
I actually liked her first one, "Ego Girl", because it was ADHD in the best and worst sense of the term; Gynning was all over the place and extremely honest, which really made for some funny, laughable, interesting and tragic anecdotes. One could understand her.  
  
This book, however, is filled with contradictions, stories repeated, blatherings between her and a psychic about her _previous lives_ which - of course - are all interesting and larger than life; why can't people who claim to have lived past lives simply say "I used to be a farmer. Did regular farmer's stuff. Nothing more than that." but claim to be Napoleon in some sense?  
  
Gynning retells stories of her mother's mother, and I've no idea why, really.  
  
There's a Q&A section at the end of the book that seems to be taken from her blog.  
  
While her prior autobiography struck me as interesting, this one recounts a lot of her career in TV, which bored me. Her writing is filled with wordings that are apparently - all too apparently - construed to make her seem intelligent and cunning, which all ends up with a structure not too far fallen from that of the Harlequin novel: it's all "And her hard times were forgotten by all but herself, those tragic years..."  
  
Writing about yourself in the third person is ludicrous, but if that wasn't enough, she does it after _almost every chapter_, in **italics**. Yes, _in italics_. To emphasize. Yes. EMPHASIZE the IMPORTANT STUFF.  
  
I wish I could forget all of this. Don't ever buy it. I paid 37:50 SKR (appx. 6 USD) for this, and I wish I could get every Crown back.

Tomorrow we're holding a dinner for Sebastian and Ebelinda, possibly even for Mikael, so we went to shop produce. First up, though, we ate at a good little restaurant; I can't remember the name of it, but hopefully the pictures in the gallery of today will help those who venture there...after reading my review? Hell no! Anyway, they offered a buffet where you paid by weight. I filled my tray to the very brim and had to pay 88 crowns for it, and there's a picture of all the goodies offered in said gallery.

We then ventured to [Myrorna](http://www.myrorna.se), the most well-known second-hand franchise in Sweden. We rooted through loads of cupboards, racks of clothes, mounds of records and laughed heartily at a lot of stuff. Just check the gallery! I couldn't believe some of the album covers, and that's nothing compared with their book collection. The one record I didn't laugh at, I actually bought. I got myself Photek's "[Modus Operandi](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:rh9hs31ia3vg)" for 15 crowns, a steal. The CD was, of course, encrusted with stuff I did not care to know much about, so I wiped that off when I got home, and the album played well; Mikaela said it stressed her out though.

We got ourselves good produce from the local green-market and also from Munirs Livs, the best purveyor of non-Swedish produce in our proximity - possibly competing some with the store in Bredäng.

From the lair of Mr. Doherty's recent _[Stookie + Jim BFest Demos](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=4FL536RN)_ (82MB) as shared by Peter himself through [French Dog Blues](http://www.frenchdogblues.com), here is the isolated instance of music that is a demo version of "Delivery", the soon-to-be-officially-released first single from [Babyshambles](http://www.babyshambles.net)' coming second album.

The lyrics seem, I think, a dirtied version of what was found on Babyshambles' debut album, "Down In Albion"; it seems that Mick Jones' somewhat shoddy production skills have been cast aside for sloppier lyrics, although I haven't seen any other than for this specific track: "Delivery" isn't exactly classic Pete material in my opinion, even though the chorus is good and melodies are nice. Mind you, this is only a demo.

Here are the lyrics:

> By and by the way of an explanation Cast adrift of the shores of shotters' nation I had a lick, it caved my skull in like a brick And then what use am I to anyone Will fade, forlorn, frozen beneath the summer Don't sing along or you'll get what I got
> 
> So, here comes a delivery Straight from the heart of the misery, oh Here comes a delivery, straight through the heart of you, yeah you
> 
> And you, will finally, let's screw Now what on earth do you intend to do See if you can take the man go down town And all, you skins and mods, now get together Make pretend it's 1969 forever Or find a girl, have a drink, have a dance and play
> 
> Songs of delivery From the harshness of misery, oh It's a song that deliver me, straight to the heart of you S'comes a delivery Straight from the heart of the misery, oh Comes a delivery, straight to the heart of you

Here's an electrified version of the song from Babyshambles' performance at Glastonbury this year:

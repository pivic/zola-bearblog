[![Kamikazekaniner - den ultimata själv(mords)biografin](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1326002196m/13397388.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13397388) [Kamikazekaniner - den ultimata själv(mords)biografin](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13397388) by [Andy Riley](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32674)  
My rating: [1 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/258236588)  
  
Quite the flogging of a dead horse, this edition brings very little to the canon. If one can stretch this concept by branding it canon. "Loads of thoughts from the pub on death assembled into one book" is more like it.

Grave-robbing comes to mind.

These are mostly-one-panel-drawings of suicidal bunnies. They pick fights, stand underneath stalagtites, put their heads between the hands of gigantic clocks as it's 12:58, they stand underneath helicopters and jump... You know how it'll go.

I think this volume - having read one prior - is completely unnecessary. It gave me a total of two chuckles.

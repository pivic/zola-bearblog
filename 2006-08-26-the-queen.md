As I love [Helen Mirren](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000545) in [Elizabeth I](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=niklasblog-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B000FO0AHO%2526tag=niklasblog-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B000FO0AHO%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82 "Elizabeth I"), I really await seeing her play the current queen of England in Stephen Frears' "[The Queen](http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/thequeen)", which focuses on the reactions on the nonaction by said queen, following the death of lady Di.

And now, in September, a DVD-box called "[Prime Suspect: The Complete Collection](http://play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/1032962/-/Product.html)". Marvellous.

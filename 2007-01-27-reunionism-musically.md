I've thought of the many bands who quite recently have called out for reunion-time, and I mean bands that have been really, really good:

\* Rage Against The Machine \* The Jesus And Mary Chain \* Smashing Pumpkins

Now, other bands like James and clownboats like Van Halen and The Police are also reuniting, but I just wonder: they're all playing festivals and gigs, but will they release albums again? I don't know if they'd muster anything exciting, really. Will they end up becoming U2 [Coldplay](http://suicidegirls.com/news/music/20082)?

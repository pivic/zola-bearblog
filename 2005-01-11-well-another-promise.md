[The story](https://niklasblog.com/index.php?p=425) goes on! Yesterday morning, a guy from Engström Telecom called me and said my phone was "ready to be shipped!"

I didn't feel like telling him their so-called service is beyond insane at this point, as I was promised said phone a week previous to this one, but instead asked him whether or not I was guaranteed to have the telephone the day after:

He: "Yes, I will put the phone in the mail today, which means...you'll have it tomorrow." Me: "You're saying you _guarantee_ that I'll have it tomorrow, then?" He: "Of course!"

Well, today is said day, and have I received the phone? No.

I'll give them one day for that telephone to arrive, before I'll translate just about everything I've written on this and hand it to their bosses verbally. I don't believe in harsh punishment as a way to solve problems, and I will not use it in this case, but a support organisation can only get better by learning how they malfunction. And this company does in ways I haven't come across in years, I think.

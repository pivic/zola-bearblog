Today, DN has posted [an article \[in Swedish\]](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=147&a=268683&previousRenderType=6) on kids and electronic games (i.e. computer and console games), where a scientist, Jonas Linderoth, who's studied how children in ages 6-12, experienced said gaming platforms. The one thing about his work, that sticks out the most, is that he considers every child capable of differing between the game world and the real world. For some, this may be an exhilerating _a-ha_\-experience, and for the rest of us, most of who have played all types of computer games, this is "preaching to the converted". For instance, Linderoth refers to kids telling their friends, while playing, they've only got one life left. This doesn't open for an existential conversation, but merely informs the player's friend of the dire need of completing something or other, before a digital character ceases to exist in some way. Death doesn't always have to be sudden and violent, especially nowadays. I remember when I used to have a Commodore VIC 128, on which I'd lash out, playing "[Blood 'n' Guts](http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=304)" or some other heinous game. And of course I didn't throw my little sister into a wall or drink 5 liters of beer in a gush, just because I did those things in that game. Well, I waited with the beer thing for a few years more, any way.

I also think one can now count mobile telephones as game consoles. As the phones today often carry a colour screen capable of displaying good graphics, I don't think it'll be long until the first "[Sim game](http://thesims.ea.com)" finds its way into a telephone.

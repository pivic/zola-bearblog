![Dusty](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-12-22-dusty.jpg)I've worshipped [Dusty Springfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Springfield) ever since I got word of "[Dusty In Memphis](http://www.rhino.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=75580)" ((By the way, you **must** get [the Rhino reissue](http://www.rhino.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=75580); it's remastered with 14 bonus tracks that are good. You must own this album. Seriously.)) and I can't tell how many times I've played that one. Every track is ace. Forget about "[Son Of A Preacher Man](http://hype.non-standard.net/search/son%20of%20a%20preacher%20man/1/)" - which is an excellent track - and concentrate on the whole instead. That album is blinding in _every_ aspect. There's even [this book](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Booksources&isbn=0826414923) written about [the album in question](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:axkbikl0bbf9), released through [33â…“](http://33third.blogspot.com).

Enough about that. You know it's very easy to get riled-up about things you feel so incredibly passionately about. So, why have I included "[Magic Garden](http://tinyurl.com/y987te)", which is a track not even included on that album? It's extremely special, that's why. I've heard this song dozens of times and it never withers; it's such a stomper that builds infinitely based on the horns, the piano and the bass that most songs rarely even touch. It's as if Dusty does it without even the least trouble. And 01:20, when "_And when you're dreaming_" kicks in with that bass and piano...my heart nearly, nearly stops...and the songs just carries and goes into overdrive as it calms down before going into overdrive, ending with a camp fade-out, and I immediately restart it, getting more and more and more out of it.

I think it was first released either as a b-side, or accompanying [this compilation-album](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-12-22-magicgarden.jpg) from 1973; I do know it's included on Rhino's quite recent golden collection titelled "[One Kiss Can Lead To Another: Girl Group Sounds Lost & Found](http://www.rhino.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=74645)".

As usual, the track will be deleted in a week, so replay it over and over again, giving yourself a very merry xmas.

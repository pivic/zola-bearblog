[![Bakom Stängda Dörrar](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1250527884m/6714935.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6714935) [Bakom Stängda Dörrar](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6714935) by [Kristina Hansen](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3023338)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/201977476)  
  
This was a horrific read, quite similar to that from Anne-Marie West, the daughter of Rosemary and Fred West, who had to suffer through seemingly intolerable amounts of abuse.

Kristina Hansen seems to have been through hell, which came in three parts: her father, the main abuser, her mother, who ducked away whenever things were too bad for her to handle - indirectly sacrificing her daughter in the process - and society, mainly through the social services but also through school, the police and hospital staff both in Norway and Sweden, where everybody seemingly let the buck pass to "somebody else", despite the veritable mountains of abuse visible to all, even through Kristina's absence.

This book is told in a very no-nonsense, don't-feel-sad-for-me way, which makes it radiate even more powerful than otherwise. Still, I have the feeling everything in the book is the truth; the first 30 pages nearly made me weep and the remaining 90% of the book weren't easier to my system.

Very well-written, and Kristina Hansen is incredibly strong to have undergone what she has been through, seemingly remaining dented and strong.

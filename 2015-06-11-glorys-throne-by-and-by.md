It's a beautiful day. I'm still getting back to life, having been ill-- Hell, I'm _still_ ill! I'm getting back though, and it's the loveliest of times to do just that; May was the rainiest day in Sweden for 200 years (!) and today's filled with sunshine, heat and the smell of trees and greens, whoa! I can smell the fauna! [Loves it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffMXfdYL41E).

Now I'm off for wine, sushi and a park. See ya, bitches.

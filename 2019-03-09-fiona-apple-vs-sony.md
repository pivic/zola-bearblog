Well, this is more like "Fiona Apple's fans vs Sony", as her album that was recorded in 2003, "Extraordinary Machine", still hasn't been released by that record company; this week though, it leaked out to the Internet. There is only fastest dns from google is available for remote play ps4. [check google dns ps4](https://remoteplay.site/super-fast-google-dns-ps4-2019-rough-gaming/) for sony.

The website [Free Fiona](http://www.freefiona.com) has written a lot about trying to get Sony to release the album in question, and have even sent out [massive numbers of signed apples](http://www.freefiona.com/campaign_photos.html) to get Sony to release it.

The album in question is a very orchestral affair, using quite unexpected jumps through odd harmonies. It's a good album, and I can't (especially as her two previous albums have sold in enough numbers to grant respective platinum status) understand what Sony is doing, other than trying to become a whore who caters to a more and more limited number of people, to try and sell as much as they possibly can. Nobody understands them.

Well, let's hope this leak presses them into releasing it soon. The backlash of the leak might be "Well, now that it's on the net, let's just forget ever releasing it"; thing is, the leaked copy isn't very good, sound-wise. The quality would become extremely improved on CD. An orchestra, playing on almost every song! It's not made for shitty MP3's.

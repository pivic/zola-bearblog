Last week I spoke with [BLOMMOR4U](http://www.blommor4u.se) (translates as "FLOWERS4U", in Swenglish), which is the local florist in Bagarmossen, where I live. I wanted peonies for X's birthday, and I wanted 20 of them. They said they'd cost 20-30 crowns each, so I then loudly said I'd go for 10 peonies instead, ending up paying a total maximum of 300 crowns. Yeah, nuff said. I'd pick them up on Saturday. Great.

So there I ventured, and picked up the flowers. "That'll be 500 crowns, please."

Come again?

I noted that the price was jacked up nearly twice as much as it possibly could have been, according to prior info. The person I met at BLOMMOR4U told me that she was the one that I'd spoken with on the phone when ordering, told me that she had in fact said that the flowers could cost 50 a piece, and added "earlier this year the price was even higher, 85 crowns per peony". Well, I clarified, when speaking over the phone I'd told her that I would have to go for 10 peonies instead of 20 because the price was higher than I'd expected; at that point I'd even said out loud that the maximum limit for 10 peonies would amount to a total of 300 crowns.

To this, I received silence. I then, again, told her the price was far higher than I'd been told that I could pay. At this point reality turned to pay or leave, so I paid and simultaneously vowed never to set my foot in that place again.

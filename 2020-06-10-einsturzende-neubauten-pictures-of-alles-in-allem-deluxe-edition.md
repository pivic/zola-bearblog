I was fortunate to get hold of [the deluxe version of _ALLES IN ALLEM_](https://neubauten.org/de/releases/ltd-deluxe-box-set-einst%C3%BCrzende-neubauten-alles-allem), the new album by Einstürzende Neubauten, before it sold out at their site. There are, at the time of writing, a few available via other sites.

Here are a few pics of the experience.

From the book, a note that is seemingly dated September 10, 2019.

The back of the DVD case.

All in all, this is a brilliant box. If every band were to behave as [Neubauten have at Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/neubauten), I'd be financially ruined and very happy.

Thanks to [Highslide JS](http://vikjavev.no/highslide), "a piece of JavaScript that streamlines the use of thumbnail images on web pages", I've implemented it together with Jesse Heap's [Wordpress HighSlide JS Plugin](http://projects.jesseheap.com/all-projects/wordpress-highslide-js-plugin).

You can try it out on this blog by clicking the image displayed in [this post](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1135), and I recommend clicking the different pictures in [this example gallery](http://vikjavev.no/highslide/#examples) to see what you really can do with it. Very interesting, and I think it tops projects like [Lightbox JS](http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox) because of the many ways you can customise it.

I've composed [this very short film](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-01-11-highslidejs/highslidejs.htm), displaying how it works; mind you, Adobe Captivate cannot capture flows very well, so remember that when clicking the thumbnail, it zooms out at you.

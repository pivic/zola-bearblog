From [Robert W. McChesney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_W._McChesney "Robert W. McChesney")'s "[Digital Disconnect: How Capitalism Is Turning the Internet Against Democracy](http://thenewpress.com/books/digital-disconnect)", the following quotes merely high-light how advertising is not only deception, but a thing which most of us accept, sweep under the rug and allow to damage not only ourselves but our kids (and society as a whole). I find the quote from Alex Bogusky to be most interesting:

> The massive wave of advertising to children is considered a contributing factor in the epidemic of juvenile obesity, the growth of attention-deficit disorders, and other psychological issues, as well as the rampant sexualization of girls at ever-younger ages. ((Susan Gregory Thomas, [Buy, Buy Baby: How Consumer Culture Manipulates Parents and Harms Young Minds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/488740.Buy_Buy_Baby) (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2007).))
> 
> In 2010, [Alex Bogusky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bogusky "Alex Bogusky"), who was named Adweek’s Creative Director of the Decade in 2009 and called “the Elvis of advertising,” announced he was quitting the industry, in part to protest marketers “spending billions to influence our innocent and defenseless offspring.” Bogusky termed advertising to children a “destructive” practice with no “redeeming value.” ((Cited in [Joel Bakan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Bakan "Joel Bakan"), [Childhood Under Siege: How Big Business Targets Children](http://www.joelbakan.com/childhoodundersiegebook.htm) (New York: The Free Press, 2011), 51. See also Danielle Sacks, “[Alex Bogusky Tells All: He Left the World’s Hottest Agency to Find His Soul](http://www.fastcompany.com/1676890/alex-bogusky-tells-all-he-left-worlds-hottest-agency-find-his-soul),” Fast Company, Aug. 9, 2010.))

> “There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul,” [Nelson Mandela](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela "Nelson Mandela") once stated, “than the way it treats its children.” ((Cited in Bakan, Childhood Under Siege, 6.))
> 
> It is difficult to study the commercial marination of children’s brains and not regard it as child abuse. ((For this reason, some nations, such as Sweden, prohibit advertising to children under the age of twelve. The economist [Richard Layard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Layard%2C_Baron_Layard "Richard Layard, Baron Layard") thinks it is a highly desirable policy for other nations to adopt. I agree. See Richard Layard, [Happiness: Lessons from a New Science](http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Lessons-Science-Richard-Layard/dp/0713997699%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzem-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0713997699 "Happiness: Lessons from a New Science") (New York: Penguin, 2005), 161.))

It's hard not to think of what Bill Hicks said:

Don't forget what George Carlin said, about advertisement lulling you to sleep:

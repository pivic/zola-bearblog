![Leigh Bowery](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2009-03-15-LeighBoweryAllTogether1.gif)I just posted a comment on Zak's blog in regards to [this picture](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ZxUBTv3bS0o/SbqivoMANtI/AAAAAAAABc4/fsiAs-C7kVE/s400/beth-ditto-na-love.jpg) that he commented.. I wish [Leigh Bowery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh%20Bowery) were more well-known. Him being virtually unknown ““ despite his back-catalogue, which I (at risk of looking like a pretentious prat, which is an adjective that should play well in regards to the Bowery canon) feel plays an enormous role in society today ““ is disgrace.

First, I wish the man were alive! Dead since 1994 and buried since 1995, the man came to England from Australia and turned the club-circuit upside-down. Forget about acid house and Shoom, definitely forget [Michael Alig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael%20Alig) - who lent so much from Bowery - and think of pure experimentation and avant-garde. Bowery's designs were extreme, almost unwearable (and at times), but the idea was punk, to think without bordering yourself or being gracelessly hindered by others, physically or mentally.

Anyway, what made me think of Beth Something on the cover of that mag at Zak's blog-post made me think of how limited it is. OK, she might like it, but I'm somehow reminded of the bouncers at Taboo, a club started by Bowery, who used to hold mirrors up to the less fortunates with the words "would you let yourself in?". Why not do it fully if you are to do something, anyway?

To clarify, courtesy of [the latest issue of Interview](http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/taboo/), here's a bit from the latest issue where [Mark Ronson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark%20Ronson) interviews [Boy George](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy%20George) on the matter-mench:

> MR: Why was Leigh Bowery so fascinating to people?
> 
> BG: For me the most interesting thing about him was the way he used his body as a style statement. He was a big guy, but, because he was tall and had long legs, he looked in proportion“”even sexy“”-despite being overweight by conventional -standards. I -remember seeing him one night at a gay club called the Fruit Machine, which was always full of gym-toned muscle queens, and Leigh was naked except for a pair of big glitter knee-length boots and this puff-ball headdress that clearly impaired his vision. His manhood was shoved between his legs, and he had glued this revolting fake vagina thing over his crown jewels and was spinning around the dance floor and doing the splits. At the height of his club fame he was deliberately distorting his body to look pregnant or give himself breasts by trussing up his belly with tape. He also created outfits that made him look deformed, which was very brave. I believe this was the main thing that gave Leigh his edge. His designs were often breath-taking, but it was the way he used his body that was so utterly new and refreshing. I can't think of anyone who had done it before or to the extent that Leigh did. He was actually quoted as saying, “Flesh is my most favorite fabric.“ I've seen many a freak make a scene and go, but Leigh was a special kind of exhibitionist because he was dedicated and saw it as an art form. He was certainly embraced by the art scene. They would invite him to do performances“”of which the most famous consisted of him giving birth to his wife, Nicola. I saw that a number of times, and it never ceased to impress or revolt.

If this sparked your interest in the man, [Alix Sharkey's obituary](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19950107/ai_n9628913) of Bowery says much. Also, don't forget to check out [the documentary about him](http://www.palmpictures.com/film/the-legend-of-leigh-bowery.php), "The Legend of Leigh Bowery".

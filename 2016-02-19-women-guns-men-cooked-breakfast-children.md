Ronald Reagan: "Anyone who would approve of this kind of demonstration must be out of their minds."

That's enough to make me want to see this documentary.

Additionally, **[The Black Panthers](https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/workers/black-panthers)** actually tried to change the state in progressive and revolutionary ways. They did try to switch gender roles, were against capitalism, racism and injustice, and were documented by COINTELPRO and had members executed by police (e.g. [Fred Hampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton#Raid_and_assassination)). Now, there's "_[The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution](http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/stanley-nelsons-the-black-panthers-vanguard-of-the-revolution-premieres-tonight-on-pbs-20160216)_", a PBS film. Can't wait to see it.

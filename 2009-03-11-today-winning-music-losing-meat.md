![Morrisseys' album Years of Refusal](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-12-05-yearsofrefusal.jpg)

I would be lying if I said I weren't [happy about winning](http://apture.s3.amazonaws.com/0000011ff775f3103084f8e6004300c0002e001c.205z3-2ae22ae2a3c9e07a720bd607b7c2afef.49b82eba.jpg) a copy of Morrissey's new album, "Years of Refusal". Like I did! It arrived in a padded envelope today, unmarked apart from my name and address. And just [as X has recorded](http://cyndamoore.tumblr.com/post/85572717/jag-har-inte-vunnit-en-cd-skiva-p-ett-r), I haven't won an album for an entire year. It was about bloody time. Yeah, I know, people dying of starvation, et.c. but...a year. You cannot even imagine what I've felt for that time. Like being shelled by American B52's. Or not. Yes, I'm being ironic. I won the album by writing a 150-character-doodle on why I would deserve it, and so it went; I wrote about how my love adores Morrissey and really needs the album. It's the truth, to say the least.

Another thing that happened today had nothing to do with winning, and everything with loss! I bought a sandwich for lunch, picked it from a little restaurant near work; they have separate rows proffering different types of sandwiches and I picked one from the cheese-only-row, ran off and took a bite as I exited onto [snowy Stockholm](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/3346422676/).

Holy freaking manure. Usually, I dissect said (and bought) sandwiches as they're filled with laughable amounts of cheese, but this time I felt I needed the energy as I were to run errands in utter cold. I had my bite, I felt a salty taste. I exhaled and felt the old taste of ham. Old ham. Half-smoked meat. Flesh in the decomposing phase. Processed meat. I spat, spluttered and checked said sandwich; inside the middle was a slab of pig's innards. I threw it straight in the bin. What irritates me the most is the fact that I didn't make a mistake: as I re-entered the restaurant later, I saw loads of meat-riddled sandwiches in the veggie row.

I'm not pissed at the people who wrongly sold me that, not even about the dead taste in my mouth, but rather that I once used to eat meat often and enjoyed it.

I've been a vegetarian for almost two years, and I'm not looking back. I thought I'd miss lamb, spaghetti bolognese, sausages, chicken. Hell to the no. There's no real disgust, just no desire for eating meat, whatsoever. I'm a lot healthier than when I did eat meat, I probably won't die from salmonella or any of those other diseases that spread through flesh, and I'm not killing anybody for food.

I get vegetarianism re-affirmed, and Morrissey in the mail. Omens for you.

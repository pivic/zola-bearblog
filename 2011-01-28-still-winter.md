Still pretty.

![Liljeholmen, 2011-01-26](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5216/5390153998_a3c4b51782.jpg)

Yesterday I returned from [the Finland ferry fun](https://niklasblog.com/?p=6131). I did sing a karaoke track! Magnus and I actually hunted down the place just in time as they were closing, and we got to sing the last track, [Elvis Presley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis%20Presley)'s "_[Suspicious Minds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious%20Minds)_". We botched that one pretty horrifically, or at least I did.

This weekend will be nice. No ferry.

Instead I pep myself through [The Go! Team](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Go%21%20Team)'s "Buy Nothing Day" which features Betheny Cosentino from [Best Coast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best%20Coast) on guest vocals.

While out walking during lunch today I saw some people walking on a nearby iced-over lake. They'd plowed a clear path so that some could go skating:

Speaking of which, the European championships in ice-skating are underway in Switzerland. Imagine my surprise when I saw Aliona Savchenko and Robin Szolkowy plus St√©phane Lambiel in the wings. I wanna see more!

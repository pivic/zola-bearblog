Isn't it strange to see the correlation between downloading music and record sales, countered with the number of gripes from the major record-selling industry?

![Major record label gripes](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2009-11-30-gripes.png) _Mind you, these are **major label** mega-gripes_

Now, what's happened in the past week, I hear you ask?

> A 48-year-old Scottish church volunteer has trumped Arctic Monkeys and [Leona Lewis](http://www.last.fm/music/Leona%2BLewis "Leona Lewis") ““ not to mention U2 and Michael Jackson ““ with record-breaking sales of her first LP. [Susan Boyle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Boyle "Susan Boyle")'s I Dreamed a Dream topped the charts with the biggest first-week sales for a debut album in UK history.
> 
> I Dreamed a Dream, which is mostly a collection of covers, sold more than 410,000 copies in the UK, according to the Official Charts Company. This beats the two most recent record-holders for the fastest-selling debut album: Leona Lewis's 2007 release, Spirit, which sold about 376,000 copies; and Arctic Monkeys' 2006 record, [Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatever_People_Say_I_Am%2C_That%27s_What_I%27m_Not "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"), which sold about 363,000. ((From [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/nov/30/susan-boyle-fastest-selling-album) in [The Guardian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian").))

Of course, nobody will care about Susan Boyle's album in a few months' time. Bless places like [bleep.com](http://bleep.com), [Domino Records](http://www.dominorecordco.com) and artists like [Nine Inch Nails](http://nin.com) and others who let users download the music in a variety of ways and don't send their lawyers down everybody's pathway are more and more prone to actually doing what they should: sell music.

I think the majors are shooting themselves in the foot by going after the little people. Distancing yourselves from people shouldn't be done that way, y'all!

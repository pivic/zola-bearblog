[Here is an array of pictures](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2004-12-16) taken during this week and the last. Finally, my "The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes" has arrived! It's a lot bigger than expected, and it seems very nice. I've only read 10 pages of volume 1, and it already seems like Leslie Klinger is as good a writer as he is nice mail-wise.

I just saw a film of T-Mac going crazy. With 35 seconds left of a game, being the underdog by a mile, he does 13 points and wins the game with a little over a second to spare. Oh yeah! Check [this page](http://www.holla-front.com/forum/showthread.php?t=52473&highlight=t-mac) out to download a film of his winning moment.

At work today, we all were handed christmas presents courtesy of the employer. I got something really nice (i.e. the same as everybody else, and it's good): a juice-press-machine! Check out a picture of it among the rest above. A few nights ago I took a picture of the strange light emitted from a construction site which is visible from our kitchen window. Looked like a supernova right above a roof-top, also among the rest of the pictures.

Also, there is a picture of the living-room computer-table. Mikaela has painted it, and now she's finishing painting the little box that's supposed to carry the computer, which is to be mounted to the under-side of the table. It'll look good.

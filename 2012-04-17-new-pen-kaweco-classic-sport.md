You're now either thinking:

Niklas is a dork.

or

Niklas is a dork _and_ may I please remind myself in the near future to remove his boring fucking blog from my news-reader and/or mind.

...or you may possibly not read this at all due to having read the subject line.

or

You may have unsubscribed from me completely due to some former post.

NO, I'm not being emo - the best, nastiest laughs are to have at your own expense, yes?

Well, I know I'm a geek, and somehow these posts on my personal blog are for my own amusement and are public on the web. Yes, I know. It's all very navel-gazing, but I don't give a fuck. I just don't. Ta-raah.

Yesterday I received a [Kaweco Classic Sport Fountain Pen](http://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Classic-Sport-Fountain-Pen-Broad-Nib-Black-Body/pd/6626) in the mail thanks to Jetpens. It's tiny. I'm happy! The nib is gold-plated which means it's infinitely nicer to write through than by using another material on the nib, e.g. my [Lamy Safari](http://www.lamyusa.com/lamy_fountain_L17_safari.php)'s chromium-covered steel-plated nib, that _scratches_ in comparison.

Kicker: I mention my fascination with fountain pens to a colleague. She tells me she used to sell them and has an array of them at home, e.g. Montblanc. Argh! She told me those are made by using resin. Resin!

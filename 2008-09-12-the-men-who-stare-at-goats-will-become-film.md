YES! I've loved the book "[The Men Who Stare At Goats](http://www.shelfari.com/books/131567/The-Men-Who-Stare-at-Goats)" since [Jon Ronson](http://www.jonronson.com) released it. I think it's the one book I've given away to most friends, and I fully recommend getting it now.

And George Clooney is now [turning it into film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1234548), starring Kevin Spacey, Ewan McGregor and Jeff Bridges. Filming will start in October this year.

For those of you who don't know anything about the book, read on:

> This exploration of the U.S. military's flirtation with the supernatural is at once funny and tragic. It reads like fiction, with plenty of dialogue and descriptive detail, but as Ronson's investigation into the government's peculiar past doings creeps into the present-and into Iraq-it will raise goose bumps. As Ronson reveals, a secret wing of the U.S. military called First Earth Battalion was created in 1979 with the purpose of creating "Warrior Monks," soldiers capable of walking through walls, becoming invisible, reading minds and even killing a goat simply by staring at it. Some of the characters involved seem well-meaning enough, such as the hapless General Stubblebine, who is "confounded by his continual failure to walk through his wall." But Ronson soon learns that the Battalion's bizarre ideas inspired some alarming torture techniques being used in the present-day War on Terror. One technique involves subjecting prisoners to 24 hours of Barney the Purple Dinosaur's song, "I Love You," and another makes use of the Predator, a small, toy-like object designed by military martial arts master Pete Brusso that can inflict a large amount of pain in many different ways ("You can take eyeballs right out... with this bit," Brusso tells Ronson).

I really hope the film will be released sooner than 2010, but I'm guessing not. Go get the book until then, it's scary, funny and horrible.

[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-08-17-collage.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-08-17)This is a collection of pictures I've taken during the past two weeks, roughly. Most of them are not featured on [my flickr pages](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic), so check them out if you wanna.

It's the usual suspects: cats, food, people, buildings and signs. Am I finding a niche? I hope not.

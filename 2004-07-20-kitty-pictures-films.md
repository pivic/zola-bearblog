As Mikaela and I slept at her parents' place last Thursday, due to our living-room floor having been ground and oiled, I took some pictures of Hendrix, one of their two kitties. First I must mention [I filmed \[3GP\] Elvis](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-14-elvis.3gp), the neighbourhood cat, in the evening. The pictures are available [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-15-kitty1.jpg), [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-15-kitty2.jpg), [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-15-kitty3.jpg) and [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-15-kitty4.jpg). The videos \[3GP\] are to be seen [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-15-kitty1.3gp), [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-15-kitty2.3gp) and [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-15-kitty3.3gp).

Come Thursday, Rade and I will watch "[Smokey And The Bandit](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076729)", a relic that we both cherish. I recently bought [a triple-pack](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-07-15-smokey.jpg) incorporating all three films with Burt Reynolds, for 100SKR, so it's definitely worth it.

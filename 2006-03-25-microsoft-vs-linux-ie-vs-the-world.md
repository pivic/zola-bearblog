As [Steve Ballmer](http://www.mccullagh.org/db9/10d-7/steve-ballmer-microsoft-2.jpg) seems intent on [Microsoft litigating against Linux](http://osdir.com/Article8470.phtml), I'd like to see [Bill Gates](http://quicksitebuilder.cnet.com/sartrejp/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/bill-gates-mugshot.jpg) fight [Linus Torvalds](http://www.nndb.com/people/444/000022378/linus-torvalds.jpg) like [this](http://mosnews.com/news/2006/03/23/beatpirate.shtml).

Hey, everybody knows Microsoft needs help right now, especially considering the troubles they're having with [the latest IE-flaw](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1942732,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535) that hasn't been fixed yet.

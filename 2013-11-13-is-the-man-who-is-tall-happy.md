**[Michel Gondry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Gondry)**, director of "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" among other films and great music videos, has conversed with **[Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky)**, filmed that and animated the conversations. I can't wait to see it.

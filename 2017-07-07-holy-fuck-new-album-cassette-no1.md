Hell yes! One of my favourite bands, **[Holy Fuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Fuck_(band))**, has just released the above, which is...something I've not seen before, but was first issued in 2014. It's named "_[Cassette No1](https://holyfuck.bandcamp.com/album/cassette-no1)_".

Visit, listen and download in formats as diverse as FLAC and MP3 320/V0.

[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-05-12-davethumb.jpg)](http://www.daveclarke.com/_imgCache/5169cc24cb83967bad7ed7fa04c0fae2.jpg)This man is my favourite techno DJ, hands down.

[Dave Clarke](http://www.daveclarke.com) has for long been an inspiring force on the techno and electro scene, both through [his own releases](http://www.daveclarke.com/discog.cfm) and through [his DJ'ing](http://www.thedjlist.com/djs/DAVE_CLARKE). He hasn't released much, mostly due to him falling out with his record company a few years back which resulted in him suing them.

His DJ'ing style is great, mostly mixing funky electro tracks that'll make you dance with distorted techno beats that make you stomp with joy or/and anger. I think he's at the top of his game when DJ'ing; I don't value his own music much, except for the treasured [Red series](http://www.juno.co.uk/artists/Dave+Clarke), which isn't to say his LP and newer stuff is crap. He's still beyond most solo techno artists, methinks.

Not very afraid of progression, he's one the few DJ's who've shed their vinyl players (not completely, though) for CD-players. Dave Clarke has adopted [Technics' DZ 1200's](http://www.panasonic.com/consumer_electronics/technics_dj/prod_intro_sldz1200.asp) which he's used to mix his coming double-CD compilation, "[World Service 2](http://www.beatfreax.nl/s/7130928523/rid/422.html)". About that compilation: the first one was a smash, sold 70000 copies internationally, and more important - it's bloody good. CD one is electro, CD two is techno. The same goes for the second one. And don't you dare miss his "[Electro Boogie](http://www.mp3.com/albums/265431/summary.html)" and the second volume, "[Electro Boogie 2](http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?style=music&pid=1041795&cart=246934769)". They're really, really good dancey electro albums.

He's also mixed tracks, e.g. for The Chemical Brothers (his version of "Loops of Fury" equals the original in strength), Chicks on Speed, Underworld and Depeche Mode (click [this link](http://archives.depechemode.com/depechemode/audio/releases/mp3/do_daveclarkeacoustic.mp3) to download an MP3 sample), and continues to race on.

Sadly I haven't been able to track down a good link for you to sample his music from. [This link](http://www.beatfreax.nl/s/760edfdc1f/art_id/1079.html) goes to the latest (legal) MP3-session he's offered, which is sadly offline due to 2500 people downloading it in ten days, making the bandwidth pusher sad.

There's also [this little online interview](http://www.inthemix.com.au/chat/inthespotlight/archives/14889) where people ask Dave Clarke questions, check it out. And buy his shizzle!

[Aphex Twin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex%20Twin) has genius.

And he knows how to use it.

This is one of the most beautiful tracks I've rediscovered in a long time. It's off the album "**I Care Because You Do**" and shows that Richard D. James - a.k.a. Aphex Twin - is a very apt song-writer; I don't know about you, but I get chills through my spine when I find a song not only to be catchy, but even if it's the poppiest ever (e.g. Backstreet Boys' "_[Shape Of My Heart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbErRCv1i5c)_") or experimental as hell (e.g. Einstürzende Neubauten's "_[Die Interimsliebenden](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nufIYi_WYF0)_", I feel that what most of my favourite songs have in common is that they can be played on a simple instrument and still thrill me in most singular way(s).

It may sound silly, but after 2:40 this track almost makes me cry. Yes, I do think it is that good.

Florian Schneider was one of the founders of Kraftwerk, one of the bands that influenced me the most, especially when I started fashioning what I loved in music.

Florian in 2015, wearing a suit and hat that were entirely made from recycled plastic from sea.

I'll miss him. His music has shaped not only nearly all electronic music, but hip-hop and countless other genres as well.

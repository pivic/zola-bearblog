This documentary would be a hard nut to crack, if it weren't for its genius target. Audio interviews with Stanley Kubrick are played while bits from his films, recordings, and other regalia are displayed.

A few actors and others pop up from old video interviews. [Lee Ermey](https://letterboxd.com/actor/r-lee-ermey/)'s interview was brilliant.

Having said that, this documentary but dips its toe into everything Kubrick. There are far more sources to get into, to paint a broader picture, one of which is _[Filmworker](https://letterboxd.com/film/filmworker/)_, where Kubrick's right-hand person, Leon Vitali, tells his story of working closely to Kubrick, warts and all.

_[Kubrick by Kubrick](https://letterboxd.com/film/kubrick-by-kubrick/)_ dips its paws into what Stanley Kubrick thought on a few subjects, and it's both illuminating and inspirational. Kubrick had a lot to say about everything from Jungian theory to how humans work on different levels.

The major critique I have to lend this film is that most interview material is old. Kubrick is well-known for not giving interviews, especially not during the later part of his life, but that's why more in-depth stuff is recommendable, e.g. [David Mikics's biography](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stanley-kubrick-american-filmmaker-by-david-mikics-review-dwdhhqv8n) that was published in 2020.

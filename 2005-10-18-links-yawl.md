Here be loads of links for you, as I've been too busy to mention.

Is JT Leroy for real, or just a pseudonym? [Here](http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/14718)'s an investigative article.

New screen-shots from the latest build of Windows Vista: [here](http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/0,1206,l=162778&pg=0&s=26945&a=162775,00.asp) is a gallery of shots of the Windows Explorer interface, and [here](http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/0,1206,l=162779&pg=0&s=26945&a=162777,00.asp) is a gallery displaying the search functionality (now that indexing seems to be improved - yet one still does not know which folders are and aren't searched).

I recently ordered the very fresh semi-autobiography of John Peel's life, called "[Margrave Of The Marshes](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=niklasblog-20&creative=9325&path=ASIN/0593052528)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=niklasblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)". His widow wrote the second part of the book, as Peel sadly passed away a little more than a year ago. Looks very interesting, as he's one of the most inspiring, musically speaking, people I've ever heard.

I see Danger Mouse and MF Doom have come together to drop "[Danger Doom](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Aaujgtq7zxu44)", an album of great hip-hop-ish proportions. Get that one.

Just caught a glimpse of a horrific little e-mail a lad's published, which is from his dad, who works in the food industry. It's a recap of his stroll through the food industries of Bejing, China. Check the e-mail in its entirety [here](http://lonniebruner.blogspot.com/2005/10/your-food-is-from-china_14.html). Here are some interesting bits from it:

> I toured hydroponics facilities growing lettuce for McDonald's. Each room was twice the length of a football field and about as wide. \[...\] Then it was off to view all the animal breeding centers: Simental, Black Angus, etc., bulls and cows. Really big ones weighing more than one ton each. Then we saw the Transgenic ones: these are produced by manipulating genetic materials of two different strains. Then we saw the clones: These are produced from say a Holstein cow where you take a skin cell and dissect out the genetic material and replace it with genetic material from another cell, perhaps from the same animal or could even be from a separate animal, and the genetics might even have a special gene in it for some human trait such as the ability to produce human serum albumin.

I like [Mobility Email](http://mobility.shaneland.co.uk), a highly tweaked version of [Mozilla Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird), a very popular, free e-mail client for Windows and Linux. The Mobility Email-client allows a user (only on Windows, so far) to move the installed client plus settings (i.e. e-mail-accounts and contacts) and put them on a moveable media, such as a USB memory-piece. I've tried it, worked great. It's even got extensions installed and enabled from the get-go, allowing the user to retrieve e-mail from Yahoo! and Hotmail (among other providers) and even to PGP-encrypt your e-mails.

If [this tee](
http://www.zestuff.com/product.php?productid=81&cat=18&page=1) gets approved, I'm gonna roll Katamari-style.

And don't forget to check out [The Emo Song](http://emosong.ytmnd.com). Great stuff. Works in IE, not in Firefox (for me, anyway).

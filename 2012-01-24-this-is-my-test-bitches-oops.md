Yesterday I received the following e-mail from a tech company:

**Oops**. I'm not part of their internal testing group, and so I gathered they've done something wrong. Does the sender mean "test-bitches" or "this is my test, bitches"? Emily Dickinson would have been proud. Maybe.

That e-mail was followed by this one (where I've highlighted the important bit), do click the pic to see a readable version:

Followed by this:

It's always nice with an apology, anyway. In another e-mail they blamed the dog. I'm not joking!

Yes. The e-mail server made me use the word "bitch". I wonder what words will be used the next time an e-mail server is swapped.

Yesterday I received a little package with a little machine in it! Finally, [my triumphant, colossal win](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1539) in the shape of a little amplifier with a chip in it, allowing helpdesk personnel to chill out to either one of two sounds.

Still, kudos to [Zendesk](http://www.zendesk.com) for the gizmo!

**[ASHBERY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Ashbery)**

Mostly I wasn't a very good student and just sort of got by“”laziness. I read [Proust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel%20Proust) for a course with [Harry Levin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry%20Levin), and that was a major shock.

**INTERVIEWER**

Why?

**ASHBERY**

I don't know. I started reading it when I was twenty (before I took Levin's course) and it took me almost a year. I read very slowly anyway, but particularly in the case of a writer whom I wanted to read every word of. It's just that I think one ends up feeling sadder and wiser in equal proportions when one is finished reading him“”I can no longer look at the world in quite the same way.

**INTERVIEWER**

Were you attracted by the intimate, meditative voice of his work?

**ASHBERY**

Yes, and the way somehow everything could be included in this vast, open form that he created for himself“”particularly certain almost surreal passages. There's one part where a philologist or specialist on place names goes on at great length concerning place names in Normandy. I don't know why it is so gripping, but it seizes the way life sometimes seems to have of droning on in a sort of dreamlike space.

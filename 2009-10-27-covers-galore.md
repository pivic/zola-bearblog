As I was recently struck by [Bill Callahan's cover of Kath Bloom's "_My Baby Cries/The Breeze_"](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11075-the-breezemy-baby-cries-kath-bloom-cover), I looked up a few covers that I find lovely. You'll find the originals by hovering your mouse-pointer over the titles of the originals, just under each video.

All Swedish, all from a drunken Swede who's speaking with a friend on the phone.

Actually, this recording doesn't carry much, but it's something, at least a fragment of what it's like to go on a late-night ride on the Stockholm subway system.

The man on the Soundcloud image below is not the same man as in the recording. The picture is, however, taken on a Stockholmian subway cart.

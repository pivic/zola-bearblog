Will this sickness never end? ((It's almost been going on for years, thank you very much.)) Last week I was inundated with different types of symptoms and stayed at home the entire week. As far as health is concerned, every day this week has been wobbly. I'd much rather stay wrecked at home than at work, and as my health seems to improve one second to shit on me the next, I'm spending this week-end at home, thank you very much.

My appetite comes and goes, a numbing head-ache's to and fro and I'm feeling weak in all limbs.

Rant-mode's off now, promise!

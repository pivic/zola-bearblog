I didn't really say I wasn't invincible I started to rot Who knows they're invincible? I'm not, I started to rot

When your skin changes colour And you don't tell The reflection casts bad shadows That poison the well

There's no way you'd stand it If you knew what was going on Would trade it for anything That's working, if switched on

But how would you know? How could you even start to know? The pain, the stench, the tears, that blackened spear The burial of you

So pay the price Come out the other side Or face the scythe Held up by yourself

Just pay the price Knowing guys who are all made of ice Tremble, have stretched long, made wrong and die like Doing the same shit all over again

What is it that you want? Can you really say it? Can you live your life Having nixed and nayed it

You know There's only you to know There's only you that knows And in here, friend, you'll be waiting

The explosion is there It's quiet, so beware It's a whisper so loud That all can really take it in

And if you feel it, you know Nothing compares to that which shows When you completely open up to everything and I do mean everything That you'd give your life for

A light that shines, what is the opposite of too much wine What would kill you to be missing So go on right now Get

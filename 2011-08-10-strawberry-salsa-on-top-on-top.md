I made this a couple of days ago. To somebody who is _not_ a disaster in the kitchen it's probably fairly simple to achieve, but for yours truly it's nothing short of a miracle, which is why I'm damn proud of it.

The bottom of this was made by some creamy products. I've actually no idea what they're called in English, but I had to put the base in the fridge for two hours before adding the salsa, which was made from strawberries, kiwis, grapes (all fresh) plus honey, all mixed together which also rested a while before adding to the creamy goo.

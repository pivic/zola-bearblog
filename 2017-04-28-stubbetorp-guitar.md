Visited X's friend Johan's magnificent place on the countryside last Sunday. I borrowed my mate Michael's car and sped off. Turbo - I dig it. ((I feel like [Cyrus from "_The Warriors_"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-OYKd8SVrI) writing that.)) It was very, very calming and nice. The horses! One of them pushed and bit, but couldn't get a piece of me. The dogs ran everywhere and were very cuddly. Johan pampered us and everything was very nice. As usual, I could have driven X around all day.

Now it's time for an extended weekend. May 1st is a holiday in Sweden. Can't wait to sleep and play my new guitar. Oh, did I mention it before? I didn't.

Having owned a Gibson Les Paul copy for more than two decades...it's brilliant to finally own a _Gibson_. Brilliant.

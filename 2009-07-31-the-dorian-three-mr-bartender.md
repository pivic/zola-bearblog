OK, so first I wanted Zak to have this track but I just have to share it with the world as everybody ought to hear a track where people rap about trying to die from alcohol poisoning in one night. Wikipedia calls this "[a freestyle track by Adverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_%28Hip_hop_artist%29#Early_career)" but whatever, it rules.

Nick Cage is a _bitch_!

  

And if you think that's weak, please repeat this.

And this.

During lunch yesterday I decided to go searching for something to help me fix the bathroom sewage situation: water does leave the bathtub, but the drain overfloods almost instantly.

So, I quickly left for [Clas Ohlson](http://maps.google.se/maps?cx=c&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=clas+ohlson&fb=1&gl=se&hq=clas+ohlson&hnear=0x45d8078a3498ab3d:0x9ee7d074ff8f0077,Stockholm+urban+area&ei=3tVUTveaLIXEsgbFqvTjDw&sa=X&oi=local_group&ct=image&ved=0CAsQtgM), a leading Swedish retailer of hardware stuff and found a salesperson.

**Niklas**: Hello, can I ask you something? **Salesperson**: Mm. **N**: Well, thing is, my bathroom sewage drain is probably clogged, and I'm looking for something to clear it up. Do you have anything that I can buy for this, like a...pipe, or something? You probably know what I mean, right? **S**: We don't have pipes for that.

Well, thank you, Gracious, Loveable God, for handing me this person and The Invaluable Info He Chooses To Divulge.

**N**: OK, it mustn't have to be a pipe, just something to clear it up other than some sort of powder because the drain is made of plastic. **S**: You should try caustic soda. **N**: Well, I think that would hurt the drain as it's made of plastic; the property owner is really against it. **S**: So what, you want to clear the pipes?

By this time, Mr. Salesperson hadn't made eye-contact with me even once.

**N**: Yes, that's correct. I don't know the name of what I'm looking for, but just something that I can physically jam into the pipes and into the drain to rid it of whatever's probably blocking up. **S**: You need a _drain cleaner_. You'll find that in the plumbing department there.

He made a vague gesture towards half of the store and left.

I found the _drain cleaner_ and in the evening made myself look **really** manly by cleaning up the plastic thing that covered the drain, the drain and the pipe that went from the bathtub to the drain.

Let's just say that I found scents that probably created some short-term memory-loss. And some people think narcotics is the only stuff able to get you really, really wasted and your mind sucked into other dimensions. Hell no! Just _try_ not to get warped somewhere else when you're rinsing off old, hardened sludge, a process through which you trigger smells you'd told yourself would come but that you were really unprepared for.

The thing I bought was a rolled-up, long metal strip with a spiral at one end. It really did the job, but was a little hard to manoeuver. Blixa wanted to help by trying to fiddle with the sludge as I had half a hand down the drain and the other jamming the strip trying not to make the thing go sproink with the bathroom, Blixa and myself becoming covered in matter but I didn't let her, even though she momentarily seemed to have eight paws and four eyes. Told you that stuff was lethal!

Bottom line: even though I may seem to be against it, I love doing stuff like that. You get into something rotten and just turn it smelling great - not to mention we no longer play "Das Boot" every time it's time to shower.

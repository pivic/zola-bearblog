I went searching a bit if info on [SingStar](http://www.singstargame.com) for [Zak](http://www.flickr.com/photos/maosan/209075385), and I came across [the first SingStar-game that's going to be released for the PS3](http://www.webhallen.com/prod.php?id=61194). Jesus freaking God Richard Dawkins.

[Here](http://www.webhallen.com/prod.php?id=61194) you'll find details to knock you off your seat:

“¢ Your Playlist ““ Select and sing the songs you want. “¢ 300+ Songs ““ Entire SingStar PlayStation 2 catalogue and more available for download on day one. “¢ My SingStar ““ All new SingStar online community allows users ito upload and share audio feedback, EyeToy performances, EyeToy Snapshots & Scores. “¢ Connectivity ““ Transfer your best bits from PLAYSTATION 3 to PSP system and take your performances with you on-the-go.

I just hope it's more than the "naa-naa-naaaAAA-naaa-naaa" thing that is SingStar today; sure, with enough alcohol in them people love it, but it's not very fun if you're into improvising or adding something that's very on-the-tone-spot to the song.

Speaking of the PS3, my old mate Toby is in charge of [the Swedish official PS3 blog](http://ps3.blogg.se). Go, Toby!

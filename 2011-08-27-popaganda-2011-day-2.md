X, Malin and I were strewn out a bit from the stage where Those Dancing Days were playing the big stage; it's been a long while - four years! - since [I first saw Rebecka and her mates playing live](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/1297725208).

Coffebar or taccos?

People evidently flocked to see men doing synchronised swimming.

We heard some Delorean in the background, didn't like Jenny Wilson and Syket were kinda good. Then went home, my tummy was upside-down following yesterday's cavalcade of drink and god-knows-what. I'm not at my tippity top right now, and I'm desperately trying to forget the fact that jj - the most underrated band in Sweden - are playing at Popaganda in five minutes. For those who are there: I salute you.

**Dr. Pivic's final thoughts**:

Popaganda is getting bigger and more well-organised; this is proven in comparison with last year, and I like it. Arcade Fire yesterday was a smash hit, as were Cults and The Go! Team. More, please.

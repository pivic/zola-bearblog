When I left home in the evening last night:

When I left home this morning:

I wish I were laying in bed right now, reading a book with X in my lap. This weekend's been lovely. I just wish that the cold would leave Stockholm.

I'm reading this, Len Brown's wonderful interview book with Morrissey. Can't all books contain chapter beginnings like this one?

Gifts from sweet, sweet friends, as if their company wasn't gifts enough. Being around such sympathetic, funny, intelligent and lovely people makes me want to become a better person.

Just saw a trailer for a new TV series called "Big Tips Texas", and it looks like it was filmed at Big Racks, a place where we went while in Texas (but isn't). X and I agree that the trailer makes "Coyote Ugly" seem harmless in comparison. That was so long ago. I haven't seen that film.

I'm glad that I don't have to be out in the cold right now.

Instead, Mondays nights could equal margarita nights! And, should you ever question it, there's nothing wrong with having a drink while watching "Teen Mom". And wanting to re-watch "Capote".

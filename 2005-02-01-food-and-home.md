Yesterday Mikaela made lovely dinner and we ate it. I photographed the process first, though, available [here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-02-01). After that we went to Mikaela's parents who had made a salmon and pizza dinner, with loads of other delicious stuffs though. Mikaela's dad has just come back from Spain and gave us an entire bottle of olive oil that was made by people in the village where he grew up! Apparently they use a very old mill to produce it, and they haven't filtered the oil. It's extreme. It's so good I want to cry. I bought some ciabattas today and we ate hummous with the olive oil and it was like touching heaven.

Anyway, before eating Mikaela's parents out of the house, I started the week off by attending a course with Robin from work. The course was supposed to be on [McAfee's ePO](http://www.mcafeesecurity.com/us/products/mcafee/mgmt_solutions/epo.htm) , which was basically what the course did not include. I'm joking. No, I'm not, really.

The course featured a dyslexic teacher who spelled "prompten" (translates as "the cursor") as "promthen". I immediately started drawing characters going to their prom, asking each-other exactly when that's supposed to take place: "When's the prom, then?" I wasn't exactly giving a shizzle about the course-bizzle. The course was supposed to last all day, starting at 09:00, lunch for an hour at 12:00, and ending at 17:00. Get this: the teacher started talking about ePO (after all, this was supposed to be a course on ePO) at 13:40. Until then, she spoke about McAfee's VirusScan product, i.e. their anti-virus client software. I won't bore you with the details, so here are a few words of wisdom from her mind of wonder, adressing a crowd of IT administrators (mostly, I guess) like idiots:

"Letting your hard disk get full is _not_ good. _Not_ good."

"Microsoft SQL Server does _not_ let anybody know when it gets full."

Today I've been at work, which was a lot better. I've been speaking with users, attending a meeting and cutting out a giant full-page picture of Murre, a friend who's been chosen as "Rookie Of The Year" by his company! The man! Anyway I love it when users now enter my room and get confronted with a Primal Scream poster, a Batman & Robin poster and now - Murre.

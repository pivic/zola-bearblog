I'm right now listening to an Adam F gig for Kiss100 (broadcast 2004-09-26) which is very nice. It's brutal, aggressive and total drum 'n' bass. My only problem with it is he's incorporated jingles, not really shout-outs, by famous artists. I don't need LL Cool J telling me Adam F is a "producer extraordinaire" or Roni Size telling me who he is, on Adam F's mix. What is this? A marketing scheme? Possibly. Adam F might be poor, though I doubt it. He might be trying to promote himself. Is he? He is very big on the drum 'n' bass sky already. It just feels a bit like watching Master P on "[MTV Cribs](http://www.mtv.com/onair/cribs)" where he has strewn a few meter-tall paintings of _himself_. Yes. It is true.

Anyway, I think wanking should be confined to one's own home.

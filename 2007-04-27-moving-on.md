Today I'm moving more stuff from Fru√§ngen and will visit IKEA with my father. I'm to buy a bed, a desk and hopefully a sofa, but I seriously don't think I'll get hold of everything I need today.

My mind has been occupied a lot. Work, matters of the soul, money, landlords who have gone AWOL. I'm still writing a diary throughout all this, and will most likely continue doing it for a while; it's highly therapeutic.

I've been going through ups and downs for a while, and I know it will continue for a while. I think it'll turn out for the better. And I have friends to help me. I feel slightly senile repeating that but it's actually a mantra more helpful than you might think.

Than you might think. I've been mulling that in therapy: I'm prone to beat down hard on myself, a lot harder than on others, while quite easily placing people on my shitlist for few reasons, e.g. Christians for believing made-up stuff. OK, bad example, but it all boils down to my passive aggressions, which I'm trying very hard to get a hold of, and to unleash my aggressions in more active ways.

Life sucks now, and must get better.

OK, so I saw [Okkervil River](http://www.okkervilriver.com) live for the first time [two months ago](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1381), and I've just started booking everything to see them at The Scala come February, but this morning D.G. of [The Pirate C's](http://www.piratkatter.com) let me know that Okkervil River is one of the two first booked bands to join the roster of [Way Out West 2008](http://www.wayoutwest.se). MY LORD!

It's just too much! Unlike [Voxtrot](http://voxtrot.net), I think Okkervil River will make it to Sweden; apparently, Ramesh is right now somewhere in Helsinki instead of trying to woo us back to complete Voxtrot fandom by playing in Stockholm, but I'll try to ignore that. For the time being, I'll be listening to Okkervil River as much as possible until the start of February when X and I will invade London, England. Moahaha!

A man on the telephone, talking loudly:

> I love your daughters. I love them, man. You know? Both of 'em. Yes. Yes. Mmm. No. Yes, there are times when I don't love them. Yes. I know what I just said. Anyway I miss them, 'cause they've always been there. It's like "hi" and they'll say hi. And they're like daughters to me! Yeah. No, I'm not saying they're _my_ daughters, they're yours. Yeah, they're your daughters, man. What? I'm not _stupid_! Yes. What do you mean by _people on the subway probably think you're an idiot_? They don't listen. Ok. Hm. Right. Bye.

The man then hung up and looked sheepish.

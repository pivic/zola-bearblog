[This gallery](http://www.niklasblog.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=133) portrays a bit of yesterday. I met up with Patrik and Staffan. They were late as Patrik had to buy a couple of old chests, and I'm not making this up. The guy is manic when it comes to old stuff, which he has to own two of, every time. Two Chinese urns, two very old mirrors, two suppositories. The basics. So Staffan and he were late, and picked me up at Pet Sounds Bar, where the stereo was blaring Echo & The Bunnymen's "The Cutter" as I entered. Lovely song, that one. I have to listen to their old stuff some more, especially since I bought "[Heaven Up Here](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:ehua6jo371q0)", remastered with bonus tracks. Their coming album, "Siberia", is actually very good. Ian McCulloch's vocals are still ace, matching Will Sergeant's guitar-playing. This is way better than Oasis, and I hope the British kids (still) find interest in them, because if they do, you can be sure that Swedish youths will be dancing to it a few months later. The new album is produced by the same guy who did "Heaven Up Here".

Anyway, before that bar, I went to Pet Sounds, probably the best record store in Stockholm (or Sweden). I found Ash's double-CD singles album, "[Intergalactic Sonic 7's](http://www.musicroom.com/se/ID_No/039138/details.html)", for only 89SKR, plus Einst√ºrzende Neubauten's "[Perpetuum Mobile](http://www.neubauten.org/PM/page1.php)", a digipak with a DVD thrown in, for 109SKR. Bargains! When asked "So would you like anything else?" by the guy at the cashier, I saw Velvet Underground's box called "Peel Slowly And See", which reminded me I've got to get their "banana album" as it's available remastered. On asking whether or not the shop carried it, said guy told me I'd be a fool not to get said box instead, as the price-difference was quite tiny; instead of buying a remastered album for nearly 300SKR I could get the box for 400SKR and walk away with six of their albums, all remastered, instead of one (with the bonus CD). I went all-in, so now I've got a lot of rock up my sleeve.

Patrik and Staffan were good. Staffan refuses to go see somebody who would do his back a world of good, as "I can walk now, can't I?" which is a fucking awful way to go. You treat yourself _before_ your body starts hating you, right? It's like with yoga now: I can't imagine doing without it. My body **aches** from not doing yoga for a day. Yesterday I didn't, so tonight I will do it. I'll meet Jesper first though.

Oh, I forgot. Daddy [Jesper](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-03-marie.jpg). Guess who's having a kid? The man! He's having a child with his sweet-heart, [Marie](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-03-marie.jpg), who he has been together with for ages. I'm happy and excited for them. Imagine that! Daddy Jesper. I can't get it out of my head. Insanity! Greatness! Apparently the kid "came to" after an Iron Maiden gig. I promise, I won't tell the child...

Oh, [Super Furry Animals](http://www.superfurry.com)' new album, "Love Kraft", is really good. If you're into lush melodies, and you feel you've never accepted their very experimental side, this is more for you. It's as if Barry White and the Love Unlimited Orchestra have forced themselves on SFA. Gruff, the front-man of SFA, recently told "Uncut" that a lot of songs on this album started as loved-up but ended up being about chickens and dinosaurs anyway. Well, the lyrics are brilliant as usual. The crescendo during the part where they sing, in harmony, "I want to see the ending/of 'Citizen Kane'" is a good one. Another's where Gruff starts a song by singing "Pterodactyl/Brontosaurus". Love it! Sense around nonsense.

There's been a massive influx of new music of late, hasn't there? I mean...just hover with yer mouse pointer on the image above and you know what I mean.

And there's also new stuff in, or coming in from Foxygen, Tame Impala, The Knife, Phosphorescent, Kurt Vile, Okkervil River's recording a new album (and actually, The Black Angels have employed a producer that Okkervil have also employed), Karl Bartos, Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, Letherette, (great new electronics outfit, reminiscent of Justice and some tech house bands), Devendra Banhart, Dave Clarke (EP, but still), My Bloody Valentine (still rules), Kavinsky, Morrissey (reissues) and Phoenix. And Daft Punk!

Have I missed anything?

Time for those technical updates.

I just got word on [FreeRAM](http://lifehacker.com/software/ram/download-of-the-day-freeram-xp-pro-181724.php), a program for Windows that frees up RAM on yer computer.

PC World lists 20 applications that help your computer working better; some are free, some are "low-cost" and the list is [here](http://pcworld.com/resource/printable/article/0,aid,126037,00.asp).

[Apple may be using sweatshop-techniques to get their iPods made](http://feeds.wired.com/CultOfMac?m=141). I don't care the least about the author's call that is "stop the erosion of American manufacturing" - think about the workers instead of your nationalistic idiocy. Anyway, it's important to [point critique at Apple](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/15/Switch-From-Mac).

How about making a 93-minute-long film [using mobile phones](http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1797285,00.html)?

[This guide](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/top/how-to-encrypt-your-email-180878.php) on how to encrypt your e-mail is straight-forward, simple and very valid. No idea why you should encrypt your e-mail? [Read on](http://www.wired.com/news/wireservice/0,71071-0.html) and imagine some shop asking for your credit-card-details. This actually happened to me, less than a week ago:

I went to [Nitty Gritty](http://nittygritty.se) and saw a pair of great [oki-ni](http://www.oki-ni.com) shoes, but I had to order them over the net, [so I did](https://niklasblog.com/?p=977), but...everything fell to pieces; I paid the money through the net, but after a few days I received the following e-mail from somebody named Paul, working at oki-ni:

> Hello.
> 
> On this occasion we require additional proof. Please fax or email, a photocopy of the front and back of the card you used to pay. We are sorry to cause you any inconvenience, this is purely a fraud prevention method and will only be asked for once. Please reply as soon as possible to ensure that your order is not delayed further.
> 
> Thankyou for your co-operation.

That's strange. Their web-site [parades](http://www.oki-ni.com/okini.storefront/4496fbf70002b9582740c0a801c3068a/UserTemplate/58) the benefits of [SSL](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html) yet this is not enough? Strange. My money was weirdly enough in a sort of credit-card-limbo (i.e. I couldn't use them but they weren't fully transferred) at this point. Well, why not oblige, and since oki-ni claims to love security, I reply the following to Paul:

> Hello, Paul!
> 
> As I definitely want these shoes, I would like to oblige, and I wonder if you are able to receive e-mail that are encrypted in any fashion. Another solution would be for me to encrypt a file containing the images you require, and send you the password required to open the file by fax.
> 
> Would any of these methods suffice? Sending a fax or e-mail with my complete card-details would not only put me at extreme financial jeopardy, but is not secure in any way; as you ensure your own safety by requiring proof, I ensure mine by requiring a safe way of sending the information you require.
> 
> Should the latter method be your choice, please e-mail me a fax-number which I can find on the oki-ni.com site, so that I know I can trust the contents of your e-mail.

I don't think that e-mail was very weird or hard to understand, especially not for somebody who values safety or financial security, like oki-ni, but Paul's reply to my e-mail was weird:

> Hello. Please send the requested proof by fax or attached to an email. Reagrds, Paul

By this time, you're probably thinking "Paul" was a scammer simply out for my cash. I imagined that from the start, considering the spelling-errors and weird formatting of the e-mail. Anyway if he _was_ a scammer, how come 1) my money was strangely still in hiatus and 2) every bit of information in the e-mail-header matched (IP-addresses and routing)? Yes, e-mail-info can be spoofed, but anyway: I thought I'd just ride the dragon to see what happened. At this point I sent the following e-mail back to Paul:

> Dear Paul,
> 
> I hope you are implying that my suggested methods are acceptable, as merely sending photo-copies of said card by fax or e-mail, without any form of verification or security, is, financially, extremely dangerous for me.
> 
> Hence, for clarification: is it OK for me to send you the photo-copied card through either of the two ways I suggested in my e-mail to you sent 2006-06-01? If not, I ask you to cancel my order immediately.
> 
> Please acknowledge the next steps by answering to this e-mail as soon as possible.

Paul was yet again very supportive - by cancelling my order. The money bumped back into my account and no shoes were bought. Isn't it strange how some companies ditch loads of money into supplying products they claim to be quite singular - only to diss their own words and act with neither class or service. Good riddance.

Looking for a "ground-up implementation of a Microsoft WindowsÂ® XP compatible operating system" yet running from Linux? Try [ReactOS](http://www.reactos.org/xhtml/en/index.html).

Or maybe you're looking for a lot (nearly all) streamable South Park-episodes through the net? [Look no more](http://www.piczo.com/allaboutsouthpark?g=11323462&cr=3).

Speaking of which, [here](http://www.comicbookdb.com/index.php)'s a new online database for comics.

You're looking for a way to backup your Firefox data? Look no more. With [these two extensions](http://lifehacker.com/software/firefox-extensions/download-of-the-day-febe-and-cleo-180710.php) you can also backup and mash all your Firefox extensions into _one_. They work brilliantly.

As The Pirate Bay works on to ridicule Hollywood, the Swedish anti-piracy-leagues and the Amurkan white house, they have also made [some comical DNS-chances](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/06/15/piratebay_hides_anti.html). I guess those guys love [MoBlock for Ubuntu](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=192559).

Remember testing? Not many people think twice on how much money you can really save by testing your ish before sending it into production, and this applies to everything you can test before releasing to production, i.e. not only IT-stuff. Check [this article](http://news.com.com/2100-1014_3-5316664.html) on how Microsoft should have tested more and perhaps avoided to waste millions, if not billions of US dollars.

The Criterion Collection is releasing the box-set "[Olivier's Shakespeare](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/connections.asp?id=63)" in July without much ado, where [Lawrence Olivier](http://www.laurenceolivier.com) played Shakespeare. Remember, kids, "[Richard III](http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=213)" is the film that made [Johnny Rotten](http://www.johnlydon.com)'s stage-ways. True!

"_[Color Me Obsessed](http://www.whatwerewethinkingfilms.com/colormeobsessed/)_" is an interview documentary film about [**The Replacements**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Replacements_(band)).

You don't need to know anything about the band to appreciate the below, which is a video clip that really, for me, nails why one loves any music artist at all. It's honest, poignant and beautiful.

The interviews with Robert Voedisch and Elaine Pan really nail it for me; his story on growing up with an album that can really be closer to you than friends are, and her words on how horrible you can feel while growing up is something all can relate to. It's universal, these feelings and music, and will naturally always be intertwined.

Buy the documentary!

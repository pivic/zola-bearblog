After getting [my hair cut](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-03-newhair.jpg) by [Nicola](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-03-nicola.jpg), I met [Jesper](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-03-jesper.jpg) and went to VASA, where he drank a couple of beers and I a couple of [Fernet](http://www.fernet-branca.tv). We then ventured on to Roxy, where we had a great time at the bar. Roxy really is a very nice place! The staff are very courteous and friendly, offering good tips when one wants something to drink or eat, and even their bar-stools feel luxurious. That may sound weird, but imagine sitting on a bar stool for two hours without feeling as if you're male in a USA-pound-me-in-the-ass-prison. That's good (in my book). We sat there for a while and were accompanied by [Marie](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-03-marie.jpg) and one of their friends.

Earlier in the day, Jesper had asked me if I wanted to join them to a club, but I had to sign up first through the internet. OK, sure thing. I did, and we went there after Roxy. The place is usually called "Vardagsrum" ("Living-room") but this is a new club hosted in part by a couple of Marie's friends, and it's a members only-club as they don't want any wankers around. I totally understand what they're saying.

The place was huge! When first entering it, thick layers of red paint led you down stairs where the surrounding walls had been covered by lights, and you could hear weird electronica bouncing at you from some faraway place. Great! Well, they didn't accept any credit cards which wasn't very great, but meant Jesper and I had to venture into the night to find a telling machine. No sweat - the night made up for it easily.

[The bar](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-03-bar.mp4) \[164KB, MP4, QuickTime film\] was really nicely furnished, the staff was very young, nice and service-minded. Yeah! The people were glitzed up; I wore a washed-out tee stating "FISTFUNK" (a Swedish band, don't get any ideas) so well, I wasn't in the fashion swing of it all, but that didn't stop Jesper and me from walking around the place, just taking it all in. It's a massive, great party-house, and Stockholm's best kept secret when it comes to facilities. Everybody was calm, just basically looking like they felt at home. And it all felt extremely nice. [This little film](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-03-charles.mp4) \[573KB, MP4, QuickTime film\] shows Jesper and Charles Bronson (!) in all their splendour in one of the basement rooms. Really, really nice. By the way, [Charles Bronson](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-03-charlesbronson2.jpg) is my dad's favourite actor.

We heard some strange, yet very familiar noise emitting from a part of the Charles Bronson-cellar room, so we checked it out. It was [an effing ping-pong table](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-03-pingpong.jpg)! Jesper and I have played table tennis together for I don't know how long, but we played like mad with two of Marie's friends. All of us did better and better, but as time passed with us flying and swooshing about trying like mad to outwit each-other, more and more people wanted to take our places, so we went to the bar. Obviously, [Jesper went smiles](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-03-motorhead.3gp) when they played Motorhead's "Ace Of Spades".

There was a contest in which one had to name the most prominent female icon one could think of. The winner would get three drinks. I couldn't think of a finalist (Mikaela? Mom? God?) so I wrote down Susan Faludi and added a motivation, very sure I wouldn't win. Hell no. Jesper won! I went bonkers for his stuff, that he wrote about one of his older sisters, Madeleine. She is a single mom, has two children and runs a company, all that (among other stuff he wrote) by herself. And he won just as we pissed off off there.

Anyway, we'll be back next time!

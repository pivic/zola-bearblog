[![The Unwritten Vol. 3: Dead Man's Knock](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1298167601m/8560639.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8560639-the-unwritten-vol-3)[The Unwritten Vol. 3: Dead Man's Knock](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8560639-the-unwritten-vol-3) by [Mike Carey](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9018.Mike_Carey)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/167423268)  
  
As the story and plot thickens, new parallel stories emerge and yet, Mike Carey manages not to muddle things by making this collection of stories complicated; instead, it's growing more complex.  
  
Easily compared with "Sandman", this story branches out towards epic characters and stories, blending literary characters such as Harry Potter and the stereotypical vampire with authors, e.g. Rudyard Kipling and Mark Twain.  
  
The story goes on, Tom/Tommy being hunted by different parties throughout different ages and tales. I shan't say more about the innards, but the story is definitely matured since volume one and is intricate. It's like getting to know the well-developed characters that make all of this come alive, which it most definitely does.

From the often-funny, always-updated site dedicated to punchy one-liners on e-cards, here's a collection of postcards to upset the recipient with laughter.  
  
The postcards are printed using paisley backgrounds with stylised pictures in black/white and, of course, a hefty one-liner on front, e.g. "Happy birthday to one of the few people whose birthday I can remember without a Facebook reminder." and "When work feels overwhelming, remember that you're going to die.".  
  
These picked are more of a lasting character, i.e. they're not about Barack Obama and Lindsay Lohan - even though I personally think Lohan will last forever.

Here's a nice skimmy on one of the most well-known Swedish judicial scandals in the past decades, that's blowing up of late. Courtesy of The Guardian, it's the story of how one person has had more killings pinned on him than I've had hot dinners:

<script type="text/javascript">(function() {if (!window.CLIPBOARD || !window.CLIPBOARD.widgets) {var elem = document.createElement("script");elem.type = "text/javascript";elem.async = true;elem.src = "//clipboard.com/js/widgets.js";var s = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(elem, s);}})();</script>

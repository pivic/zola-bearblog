Amazing. X and I met up as the day had ended early - the day before the national day means a lot of Swedes work a half day - and bumped into Brother **Bobby**, who had mistaken a doctor's appointment, so we got to hang out with him instead. Great! Had a couple of beers at Lilla Hotellbaren, then furthered with coffee and a lot of talk. Always the privilege to meet up with Bobby to pick his brain, to hear his continually much-improved Swedish ((I don't know how the man picks up his Swedish at that pace, but it's grand.)), and to dig into his bruschetta as we sat at Medborgarplatsen, uncovering keys and a swanky sweatshirt, the original home of which shall forever be unknown.

I finally bought **Primal Scream**'s "_More Light_", their latest album. Gotta love a vinyl where the CD is included.

On the national day we grilled and ate with **The Pirate Cats** which was wonderful. Hung out at Söderbysjön which is a wonderful little lake nearby our home. I got to kiss X while hanging out with friends, toasting life while basking in the sun. What could be better?

This little sucker's getting older, X and I reckon. X thinks Blixa's face is telling it, and she's right. I think Blixa's getting slightly slower on the whole, which is good. I mean, she still gets up to her regular antics and attacks, but less (I hope).

Spent the Saturday alone at Söderbysjön reading Chandler with X. More sunshine.

I love hearing families talking while tanning. It reminds me not to have children.

> "Åke, why didn't you bring the tanning lotion?" "Whaddaell, you shoulda brung it yourself!" "Åke, I tooold you--" "WAAAAAA" "Little Åke! What happened!" "I kicked the ground and it hurt meeeeeeeee."

Watched a couple of films this weekend. One was "_[Last Days Here](http://letterboxd.com/film/last-days-here)_" which X picked up. That's a documentary about a very broken-down singer of the band Pentagram which had its hey day a few decades ago. The singer's a heroin and crack addict who lives in his parents' house and wants to come back. Highly recommendable. On the flipside, I do most certainly not recommend "_[Stoker](http://letterboxd.com/film/stoker)_" which we saw yesterday. What a fucking gyp! Supposedly mysterious and a thriller, it was not; on the whole, it seemed a mix between bad Asian cinema, where facial expressions saying nothing seems supposed to inspire a plethora of interest. Nicole Kidman was the most interesting bit of the film, but hey, her character and script sucked ass, so don't get hyped from my words. Avoid! But check out "Last Days Here", that film rocked.

By the way, got tickets to see **Depeche Mode** in Stockholm in a couple of weeks! That marks 20 years since seeing them live the last time around. I think it's time to re-listen to the old album! Well, now it's time to get to work.

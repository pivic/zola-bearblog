_You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off you_

And so, it's finally happened.

[![Engaged, 2008-04-19](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-04-23-engaged.thumbnail.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2008-04-23-engaged.jpg "Engaged, 2008-04-19")[X](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com) and I are engaged to be married. As I cannot wait to publish it as part of my coming post on our recent trip to Paris, I write it now. I'm elated. I'm floating at stratospheric levels while my feet are on solid ground. I'm brought to the point in 1993 when I saw Depeche Mode live, performing "Higher Love" as the first track; I'm reminded of an early morning on Hornsgatan when I listened to Okkervil River's "A Glow" for the very first time; I think of how I've sung "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" to X while lying in bed. This is a feeling I cannot truly describe.

This is unprecedented.

The ceremony ““ to me ““ held what Morrissey touched ((In the song "I Know It's Over"; the irony here is almost Wildean!)) when singing "Love is natural and real". _The blinding light_.

As I held X's hands in mine sitting in front of Oscar Wilde's grave, I felt everything was in its right place. There was no sense of wrong, no doubt. There was acknowledgement; I felt that I was exactly where I wanted to be, with Her.

She and I have been through much during our relatively short period of time together so far; we have experienced heart-shattering pains, mind-numbing sadness, the unveiling of each other in ever-delving depth and breadth, coiled with mind-expanding bliss, bare-boned happiness, independent togetherness, the growth of friendship and love (simply put) beyond the limits of what I've ever known. I feel the greatest sense of trust when divulging what are my most personal matters to her, which of course partly displays why it is so easy to do. I hope she will always feel the same for me.

All that has happened between us has brought us nearer to each other by every day. _Every day_.

_Life is changing so fast and there's nothing I can do to stop it But when I crane my neck to kiss your head, I know That there is something that I can rely on And when I strain my thoughts to push this thread I sew It's some kind of future that I can be sure of Because I love you, because I love you_

With X, I have found trust, immediate honesty and the most beautiful friendship with the person I want to live the rest of my life with. Plainly put: it's Love.

For as long as I've known X, her being has made me hear music, existing and non-existing. Right now, Gene comes to me:

_Hello, hello, hello At last I'm satisfied At last I have arrived We know, we know, we know We don't want more_

But _I_ greedily do want more of one single benefactor: time. And I aim to treasure and revere as much as I can wring of it for as long as I may.

The sun is rising as I write this. I am bathing in light.

Wherever you're living, if you're not in Stockholm, you're in the sun.

I don't care if you're reading this from Sibiria or from some kind of cold reactor that gives you a kelvin, we've got it worst. I walk out, I freeze. In the morning, I usually walk quickly from my home to the subway. In the latest two days, I've been forced to wait for buses while visiting a supplier for christmas lunch and today to leave my broken telephone at a company to get it fixed. Normally I can sit and read, but it was too cold for this. My phone's a [Qtek 9090](http://www.qtek.nu/default.asp?id=79&element=74). Suddenly, I see [a clone](http://communications.siemens.com/cds/frontdoor/0,2241,us_en_0_76051_rArNrNrNrN,00.html)! It's too cold to be writing this!

An espresso later and I'm fine. Woo-hah. No more cold, please.

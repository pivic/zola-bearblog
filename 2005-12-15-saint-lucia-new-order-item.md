Today, at work, a choir sang, celebrating what we Swedes refer to as "Lucia". This is a lovely pagan ritual best described on [this page](http://www.sweden.se/templates/cs/Event____7568.aspx). More info on the Scandinavian ritual, is found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucy#In_Scandinavia). I filmed the choir (and a few of my work-mates) and the clip \[MP4, playable in QuickTime\] is to be found [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-12-15-lucia.mp4).

New Order have finally released a 2DVD-package, compiling all of their videos and calling that disc "A Collection", while enhancing and expanding a documentary that's previously been made about them, called "New Order Story". Read more about it [here](http://www.rhino.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=970482).

Mind you, it seems like they're releasing the DVD's separately, so to avoid sorrow, get the edition where both discs are in one place.

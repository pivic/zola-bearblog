[![My typing, a bit sketchy](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2011-11-23-Typing_Heatmap.png "My typing, a bit sketchy")](https://niklasblog.com/?attachment_id=8871)

Since jumping from a hardware keyboard - I miss you, Nokia N900 - to a software one, I'm using a keyboard that can show me statistics of how accurate my typing is, which is something I discovered today by chance.

I think the picture tells me that my middle and side typing are peaks, while I'm having terrible difficulties with either "a" and "h", or just every other key.

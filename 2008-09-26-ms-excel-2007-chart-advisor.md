![Microsoft Chart Advisor](http://www.officelabs.com/projects/chartadvisor/PublishingImages/chad_preview2.png)

As I haven't written anything geeky in a while, I think it's time!

The above image shows [Chart Advisor](http://www.officelabs.com/projects/chartadvisor/Pages/default.aspx), which is an add-in for use in MS Excel 2007. From the company page about the magic:

> Chart Advisor is a prototype that provides an alternate approach for creating charts in Excel 2007. This add-in uses an advanced rules engine to scan your data and, based on predefined rules, displays charts according to score. Top scoring charts are available for you to preview, tweak, and insert into your Excel worksheet.

Microsoft have got a video up there, but screw that, this add-in is great in theory - but doesn't really work in practice. I even used the sample data that Microsoft recommend using [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/excel/archive/2008/09/25/chart-advisor.aspx); the Chart Advisor suggest one type of chart but, I cannot even use region names as placeholders; true, this is a prototype, but come on! Little can be learned through trying to use the Chart Advisor oneself. I've even created a couple of rudimentary tables of data and tried to use those, but Chart Advisor just says "Chart Advisor could not find an appropriate chart for the data currently selected." Yuck.

Still, I'll have it installed as it can be automatically upgraded whenever Microsoft releases a new version. When working, I guess it'll work as a nice step for people who would love some automatic, quick help on creating charts and don't want to learn how to create pivot tables to quickly re-generate charts to show what they need.

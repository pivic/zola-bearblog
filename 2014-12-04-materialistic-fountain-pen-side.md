I love fountain pens and accessories. Well, not all of it. But I've gotta post a little to show you what I've recently loved.

This, the Kaweco Liliput Fountain Pen, is something I fell in love with. I can't say why really. I think it's really pretty:

There's a video on how they were made!

Or how about the Bungbox stuff, like a "Original Mt. Fuji motif pen rest/paperweight":

The pen that rests on top of Mount Fiji there is horrid though.

Or, for more pretty stuff from that very company, how about the "The ink of Witch, Original bottled ink for fountain pens, 50ml, Dark purple, Blackish-purple":

That's some Tove Jansson kind of shit. I like it, as with the bottle itself. And the colour is special. Blackish-purple. Even feels good saying.

Or how about a funkily designed pen? [Namiki Raden Vanishing Point](https://fromthepencup.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/medicating-with-pens-namiki-raden-vanishing-point), 18K gold, rhodium plated. Note that the clip is on the nib end of the pen. Weird! Yeah, the pen's far too expensive for me, and I think I'd grow tired of a pen that'd twinkle that much. Like having a sparkler in your face constantly.

Speaking of trying out, where's that J. Herbin Stormy Grey?

Some grey with tiny gold flakes at the bottom. Woo. I'm intrigued.

I'll stop now. Glad to have that stuff out of my system.

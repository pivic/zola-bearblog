I've been hearing that some groups are releasing some interesting albums soon.

[Alec Empire](http://www.alecempire.com)'s "[Futurist](http://www.digitalhardcore.com/uploads/futurist_uploads/DHRCD40-Cover.jpg)" is a thrash-punk album with some electronic drumlines thrown in. It seems the [Atari Teenage Riot](http://www.damagedgoods.co.uk/atariteenageriot) front-man moves more and more towards analogue instruments, tossing the synthesizers aside. He will never, ever abandon his distortion boxes though. I wouldn't be surprised if he'd end his life jumping off a thousand-metre-high building, having forced White Stripes to back him during a complete rendition of the Beatles' rooftop sessions, using more distortion boxes than you could shake a [Merzbow](http://merzbow.net) at.

[The Plot to blow up the Eiffel Tower](http://www.blowuptheeiffeltower.com) have released a new LP, called "Love in the Fascist Brothel". A lot of DAF for a San Diego band, although they sound as if Alec Empire's joined [Gang of Four](http://www.metal-tiger.com/delinquent/gangof4.html). I don't know if that's scary, but [this](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/katyzz/cemj/CEMJ06.jpg) picture of Michael Jackson surely is.

Klute has released a new album a couple of weeks ago, titeled "[No one's listening anymore](http://www.ukrecordshop.com/shop/catalog/Klute__No_Ones_Listening_Anymore_p_17014.html)". It's good drum 'n' bass, reminiscent of Johnny L's debut album. Oh, I remember "Piper", but this is an album seemingly without hook songs like that one. Never the less, it's a very nice dnb album, so go get it.

50 Cent's "The Massacre" has a very little message behind it. Every hip-hop crazy-person who's been listening to mix-tapes from USA during the last six months, must, at some time, have come across G-Unit, 50 Cent's rap-ensemble. The problem is - choo choo, as if you didn't know this - they're shit. So in comparison, Fiddy's album looks like a masterpiece. It's fairly well-produced, even though his stuff's made by the current Dr Dre/Eminem formula: # of songs/2 = # of producers. Well, Eminem is not a good producer. Some of the others on Fiddy's album are, but the problem is: this is an album filled with half-witted sketches. Why not do something like [The Perceptionists](http://www.theperceptionists.com), whose "Black Dialogue" will (hopefully) drop in March. That album's filled with great ideas, invigorating new music from a great DJ and non-egoistic MC's incorporating most of what I love from the old skool (i.e. great lyrics about stuff that proves it's more important with thought and skill rather than just being able to rhyme a hardcore word with...another hardcore word) with stuff from the newer skool. So I've heard. Go buy that album when it drops; I know I will most definitely.

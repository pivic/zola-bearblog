Now, I often find it amusing, bewildering and extremely funny to peruse the web-server logs that are continually expanded as people read my blog. So, what are these logs and - hey - why are you logging me?

Actually, it's not me, but Bluehost, the company that hosts this blog. Keeping a log may be what it sounds like, _sans_ Captain Jack Sparrow and obligatory parrot on shoulder. No, a log that's a bit more detailed. Among what's picked up:

“¢ Your somewhat accurate geographical location “¢ Your screen resolution “¢ The name and version of your browser “¢ What you searched for to get here, should you have used a search-engine “¢ The name of your grandmother's forlorn kitty

Everything but the last - I think - bit is real, and a lot more information than that is usually gathered by the [datamining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) goblins of the web, so think about it for a second.

So without further ado, here's a little list of what people have searched for and ended up on my site because of. Do keep in mind that there is nothing pornographic on this entire site - of course, I guess there are little old people in Texas who would consider beating me to a pulp because of [this image](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2006-07-10-book3.jpg) off a book by [Lisa Carver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Carver), but whaddell.

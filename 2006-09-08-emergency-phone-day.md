I've had such a week that I've been a million miles from even thinking about my blog, but here's a couple of interesting bits from my time with the emergency phone today:

**1**. The voice

The phone rings.

Me: IT Department, this is Niklas speaking.

I hear no response, other than a voice at the other end breathing very heavy, distinctly and in a way that there could only be one answer.

M: X, is that you? X: \[launches a cough-attack that lasts for five seconds\] Well...yes, well, hello; this is X, how did you know it was I? M: Well, I recognised your voice. X: Oh...well...I've been away for half a year and now I'm back. M: So I hear.

**2**. The password

Me: IT Department, this is Niklas speaking. Y: Hello! I am Y, and my password isn't working, I think. M: I see; is the password for logging into the network, or are you using a password for another service? Y: I'm trying to log into the network and you aren't there. M: ...I'm sorry, but what do you mean? Y: When I try to log into the network you're not there to answer my questions! M: I'm sorry, but I _am_ here now, and I will do anything in my powers to assist you, so prey tell, are you unable to log into the network? Y: No. M: ...would you like me to remote-control your comp-- Y: The problem is the password. M: I see. Would you like me to remote-control your computer so that-- Y: No, please, just change my password.

I did so, instructed the user that the next time it wished to log into the network, it would have to punch in that password and then automatically be required to pick a new password. All's well.

Ten minutes later:

Me: IT Department, this is Niklas speaking. Y: Hello, this is Y again, and my password isn't working, I've tried my old password and the new one but it just said "Please change your password" and I pressed Cancel.

I took a deep breath and worked it out. The user had just misunderstood everything, but at the end of the session said user was laughing and everything worked out well. And the password was working.

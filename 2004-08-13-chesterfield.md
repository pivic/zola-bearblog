Mikaela's been to a second-hand outlet called [Myrorna](http://www.myrorna.se), where one can find all sorts of weird furniture, books and albums. Now Mikaela's hit some kind of jackpot. She found a [Chesterfield sofa](http://www.brightsofnettlebed.com/chesterfield.gif) \[not the actual product, ours is reddish and with wheels\] we're buying for 2600SKR. She's to renovate it first, and she's jumping through the roof with joy over it!

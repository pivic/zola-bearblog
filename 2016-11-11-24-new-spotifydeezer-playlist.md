Just as news of **Leonard Cohen**'s death has hit me, I remembered this unpublished playlist - and I didn't add his song to end the playlist. It's just great and it's a wondrous and sad closer.

**The Wedding Present**'s opening track has to be one of the most magnificent comebacks that a band's ever made. It's the opening track for their new album.

Speaking of comebacks of sorts, **Röyksopp**'s latest single with **Susanne Sundfør** has got to be one of the best pop singles in a year. _At least_. Reminiscent is the first single off **Vitalic**'s coming album, also included.

Enjoy.

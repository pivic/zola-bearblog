This is a real conversation I had at 09:00.

> Me: IT-department, Niklas speaking. Person: Hello, I've just changed my code, and the harddisk doesn't understand what I'm telling it to do and I could have strangled you guys this morning but then somebody told me to change my code and then it worked.

Normally, this zones a lot of people out, but as [I hang tougher than NKOTB](http://www.pittnews.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2004/01/21/400e288a91e17), I rocked the situation. Hm.

> M: Well, what seems to be the problem? P: I entered the code and it worked! M: Technically, that means nothing is wrong. Is there anything wrong with your system? P: Well, no, but it didn't work this morning. M: Ah, well, now it does work, so it should continue to do so from now on. Please feel welcome to call us again, should this, or any other problems, reoccur. P: And they tell me to use \[a certain program\], but I'm not, so they can go to hell. Hahaha. M: ...OK. Well, thank you, and good-bye!

That's about it. And people have been calling the emergency phone the entire AM as a system is troubling us after an upgrade. My throat is sore beyond comprehension even though I've been drinking water the entire time. In a couple of minutes I'll head off to eat sushi with Anos. As I didn't have a hard time enough, already! ;)

In other words, an umpire punished Serena Williams like they would never punish a male tennis player.

Subsequently, a daft, racist cartoonist did this:

The proper reactions to that did not take long to appear:

Good thing about this, is that racism is brought to the surface, and that the cartoonist and the paper he works for have basically and intrinsically smeared themselves. Fuckers.

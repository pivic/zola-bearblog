Yesterday we went to Bredäng and got hold of a few necessities, such as loads of lovely olives and nuts, and I made tomato sauce (with notable help from Mikaela). [Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-03-28) are pictures of it! I also seem to have caught something, which means my throat is sore and I feel as if my muscles have died on me. It's not as dangerous as it seems. Just come to my funeral. This hasn't stopped me from actually starting to edit my Sparks podcast project. If everything goes as it should, it should be available in a couple of days.

Tomorrow I'll start attending a three-day-long course on how to make "effective demands" while in a project. We'll see how that fares.

Oh, today both Frederic and Rade got new jobs. Congrats! What sucks though, is that Rade will move back to his hometown, Eskilstuna. Bastard. :-)

Cowon have released the Cowon D2, a 4GB PMP and CNet have a video-review available [here](http://reviews.cnet.com/Cowon_D2_4GB_black/4505-6490_7-32309446.html).

Interestingly, a way to brute-force your way to a valid Windows Vista keygen is [here](http://keznews.com/2431_Vista_Brute_Force_Keygen), about the same time [a cracked version of Windows Vista Ultimate](http://nforce.nl/index.php?switchto=nfos&menu=quicknav&item=viewnfo&id=111851) made its way onto the Internet. Maybe now, [Steve Ballmer's claim that pirating has damaged sales of Windows Vista](http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=37721) will be based on reality, and not the near-complete lack of drivers and applications for the OS.

I'm looking forward to hook up with [Scrybe](http://iscrybe.com), an online organiser with extremely nice features, such as drag-and-drop, creating to-do-lists by pasting series of data from apps such as MS Excel and MS Project plus very nice ways to use data from web-pages and present it neatly. Check out [the video preview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u3ekzwnYxw).

[Virtual Ubiquity](http://www.virtub.com) seems to offer a really nice online word-processor; judging from the pretty pictures, it's more influenced from [the iLife-suite](http://www.apple.com/ilife) from Apple than MS Office.

[Adobe Photoshop will be remade as an online tool](http://news.com.com/2100-7345_3-6163015.html). Either it will rock or it will suck the life out of web 2.0 totally; I'm hoping for extreme collaborative features, a lot of support for homebrewed plugins, filter, et.c. and a lot of non-IE-support.

[WordPress is now out in a new version](http://wordpress.org/development/2007/03/upgrade-212) due to a nifty thing; a hacker placed "exploitable code" in the downloadable WordPress-package and presto, people had turned their blog into a box of doom. Not to worry, it's all patched and tweaked now, but this is just another example of how client-side tech will 0wn your computer/network/life; when the code can be run through your web browser, where's the security?

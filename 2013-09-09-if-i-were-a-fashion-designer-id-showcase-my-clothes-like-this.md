From **[Slow and Steady Wins the Race](http://www.slowandsteadywinstherace.com)**.

I always wanted to skateboard ((But not enough to do much about it.)). I only got as far as laying my stomach (!) on a skateboard, using my weight to lean to the left or right to "steer", and then I just tried to stay alive while enjoying it.

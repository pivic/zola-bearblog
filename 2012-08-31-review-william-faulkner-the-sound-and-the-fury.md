[![The Sound and the Fury](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1341980276m/10975.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10975)[The Sound and the Fury](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10975) by [William Faulkner](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3535)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/360947618)  
  
For me, this was a hard read. A stream-of-consciousness book which was harder than Rimbaud and William S. Burroughs at the same time, once "cracked", gave a lot.

It's the insight into 1920s America, of children and adults and the lives and differences between the idiot and the people who are not idiots.

Still, I wouldn't be able to say I've understood this book. I think I'll have to re-read it a couple of times to fully get into it. Maybe it just wasn't my time.

On the other hand, it _was_ my time; just like eavesdropping on a conversation that you start listening in on mid-conversation, or if the people speaking don't make much sense, it leaves you with what _you_ pick up from it.

As Faulkner himself said of the character Benjy:

> “To that idiot, time was not a continuation, it was an instant, there was no yesterday and no tomorrow, it all is this moment, it all is \[now\] to him. He cannot distinguish between what was last year and what will be tomorrow, he doesn't know whether he dreamed it, or saw it.“

Despite the static discussions found in the text, the book is very rewarding, if you can get past the language barrier; Faulkner has written dialogue much in the same way as José Saramago wrote "_Blindness_", and that Irvine Welsh wrote "_Trainspotting_": it's quasi-phonetic and at times lacking exclamation marks and question marks.

And to finish, I quote Shakespeare's "_Macbeth_":

> "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow/ Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,/ To the last syllable of recorded time/ And all our yesterdays have lighted fools/ The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!/ Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player/ That struts and frets his hour upon the stage/ And then is heard no more. It is a tale/ Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/ Signifying nothing.“

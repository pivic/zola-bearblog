I recently updated my Nexus 6P phone to a developer preview of Android O, the next major release of Google's Android operating system.

A friend informed me that [Android O would enable both aptX and aptX HD](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/15004562/sony-google-android-o-ldac-wireless-music), and I tried, but failed. I added a comment to [this bug report](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/63106623) but today received this saddening news:

> Status: Won't Fix (Intended Behavior)
> 
> Unfortunately support for aptX and aptX HD are not supported on Nexus 6p and Nexus 5X - only on newer devices.

Drat!

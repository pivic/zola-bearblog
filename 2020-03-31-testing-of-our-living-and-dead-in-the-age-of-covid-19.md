From [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/sethfischer/status/1244671758554152964).

Isolate. Test people to know whether they have/have had COVID-19. Keep investing in developing a vaccine. Come together; show solidarity far beyond national borders or between neighbours. That's what I think will lead to COVID-19 dying down in the end and to regaining decency.

Sweden—the country where I live—is highly individualistic; self-reliance and independence is drawn so far that we tend to die alone.

Back to COVID-19 and my [blithering](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blithering):

Protect those who don't easily have access to money, food, water, or other conditions that can help them.

Think about how COVID-19 affects people like the indigenous populations of Earth, e.g. [people in the Brazilian Amazon](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/23/the-isolated-tribes-at-risk-of-illness-from-amazon-missionaries) and [native Americans](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/covid-19-a-bigger-threat-to-native-americans/ar-BB119w6k).

We cannot let money dictate who lives or dies.

We need democracy, not [plutocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy).

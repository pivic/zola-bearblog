Today I found [SiteAdvisor](http://www.siteadvisor.com), a brilliant extension for Firefox - but don't fret if you're an IE-user, there's a working bit in there for you, too. The extension helps you to quickly get stats on _how_ safe a web-site is. The SiteAdvisor-team say it best:

> We browse sites, download files, and enter information on sign-up forms. We document all these results and supplement them with feedback from our users, comments from Web site owners, and analysis from our own employees.

Trusted sites are marked with green ticks, less trusted with yellow and untrusted with...red. Very simple, and you can quickly see exactly why these sites are marked the way they are. Untested sites, then? Well, they're marked "untested".

I've been using it all day, and it's very nice, especially since it's marked my site as green in all ways, wee! More info on SiteAdvisor is found [here](http://www.siteadvisor.com/about/overview.html), and you can find a detailed example on why a site is not marked as green right [here](http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/download.com/downloads/312910); as you see, the program available for download chucks in a hefty amount of spyware and yucky registry info.

While on the issue of badness, I believe "[V For Vendetta](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/v_for_vendetta)" will continue to delve into critic's hell, if the critics have taste, that is. Check how much Alan Moore (the creator) hates the film-script [here](http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&article=2153), and how much I love Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel, [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=200).

Speaking of yucky, no more of that in the future, when Microsoft will (maybe) release StepUI! So, what's that? Bear with me, I'm not making this up. It's a way to dance your way through a user interface. Check [this article](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1932400,00.asp) about it, and you can download a PDF displaying a couple of bizarre pictures of the whole thing. More about it, with pictures, [here](http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2636).

We've got the Minipods in place! Finally! I swallow my pride and will be glad to admit my weakness: today, I ventured to Hifi Klubben and explained the deal. The things designed to hold the minipods in place must have been constructed badly. We followed the instructions to the point, but I wasn't able to get them fully into place, no matter how hard I pushed. Mind you, I wasn't interested in breaking them, as they did cost quite a lot. Anyway, the guy in the store listened to my woes and tried the same thing. "Click." They fell into place. I just held my face. "Well, the instructions doesn't say you have to push them until you hear a click \[...\] it's better that I tried to jam them together in the shop; if they'd broken in your home, it would have been your problem, but if I'd broken them we'd instantly replace them". I humoured him by saying he could stop being nice, I told him I just understood I was weak and we both laughed. How very nice of him! Well at home, everything worked without any problems! We got the speakers up in no-time, and due to the right part of the wall being more porous than the left side, the drilling took two minutes all in all. Everything went up and it's all happy days. A more panoramic image is found [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=106418049), displaying the minipods guarding the TV.

[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-02-babybikinithumb.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-04-02-babybikini.jpg)According to [this article](http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/foraldrar/story/0,2789,625003,00.html) from Aftonbladet (thanks, Frederic) I was notified that Lindex and H&M, both major retailers of underwear, are selling bikinis to 1-year-old girls (and up through the ages, of course). Another big retailer, KappAhl, sells similar bikinis to girls from three years old and up.

A spokes-person from Lindex says "We've made a mistake", but adds that the upper part of the bikini, the one for the bosom, is to "protect from the sun" which, of course, is absolute bullshit. Then why not manufacture a piece made for children (who, incidentally, don't have ANY type of bosom to speak of, when 1-3 years old) that covers the entire upper part of the body? I say absolute fucking bollocks to the people manufacturing, distributing and selling this shit. And to the eventual buyers, of course!

For there are people who purchase this; a spokes-person from H&M says their company is merely adjusting to the demand by supplying the goods. Fair enough, it's market economy. Right now I'd love to purchase hollow point ammo to go with a sniper rifle with which I'd like to kill the entire chain of people responsible for all this incredible, yet existing, pap. When can I buy it at H&M?

I cannot properly jot down the disgust I'm feeling right now as I'm ready to hurl over my keyboard. This is such utter destruction of all things intellectual. Talk about turning women into flesh-objects (as opposed to thinking individuals) at an early age. So do Lindex, H&M and KappAhl sell dildos and butt-plugs made for one-year-old boys?

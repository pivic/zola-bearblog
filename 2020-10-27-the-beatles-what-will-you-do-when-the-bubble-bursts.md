The following is a bit from the absolutely shatteringly brilliant _150 Glimpses of The Beatles_ by Craig Brown:

**Q**: What will you do when the bubble bursts?  
  
**JOHN**: Get jobs.  
  
Press conference, Los Angeles, 23 August 1964

**Q**: What will you do when the bubble bursts?  
  
**JOHN**: Count the money.  
  
Press conference, Cincinnati, 27 August 1964

**Q**: It’s assumed that you will sing for quite some time yet, but what do you plan to do after …  
  
**GEORGE**:… the bubble bursts.  
  
**PAUL**: Nobody’s made any plans, but John and I will probably … (laughs) Ooo, we have this one every day, you know. John and I will probably carry on songwriting. And then George will go into basketball.  
  
**GEORGE**: Or rollerskating. I haven’t decided yet.  
  
Press conference, Kansas City, 17 September 1964

**Q**: Fred Paul from KAXK. First of all I’d like to say Hi to you all again, it’s really good to see you. I’d like to ask a question that you’ve never been asked before.  
  
**JOHN**: Oh no.  
  
**Q**: What are you going to do when the bubble bursts?  
  
Press conference, Los Angeles, 24 August 1966

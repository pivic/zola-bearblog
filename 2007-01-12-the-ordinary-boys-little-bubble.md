![The Ordinaries](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-01-12-theordinaryboys.jpg)Ever noticed how a song with [crappy lyrics](http://www.lyricsdownload.com/ordinary-boys-the-little-bubble-lyrics.html) can still be great? This is a stellar example of such.

[The Ordinary Boys](http://www.theordinaryboys.com), a name that is culled from [a song by Morrissey](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/_/The+Ordinary+Boys), smashed through with their debut album, "Over The Counter Culture". Little wonder, then, that the man added this odd track to [one of his own compilation-CD's](http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/Songs+to+Save+Your+Life+Compiled+by+Morrissey) managed to get the world to notice it. It's a great track, and perfect for Anglophiles such as myself.

Being a band made up of 22-year-olds, I must say I'm happy to champion their debut-album; I didn't hear anything like it until last year, when Arctic Monkeys plodded along and got the crown.

As usual, this track will be deleted in a week.

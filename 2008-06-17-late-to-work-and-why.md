Today I was late to work. Why? Because a semi-old lady fell in front of my eyes as I walked down [S:t Paulsgatan](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Sankt+Paulsgatan+29,+Stockholm&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=47.033113,76.992187&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=addr) in Stockholm. She took a nasty step and missed the sidewalk, thereby almost breaking her ankle; she fell to shreds and hurt her face in the process.

As she lay after the fall, her groceries spilled out all over the ground, rolled under cars and onto the busy road right next to her, she seemed at ease. I know it sounds weird as hell, but she was laying there with one arm under her head and the other next to her body - not at all unlike X as I left her sleeping at home this morning - her face was really dented from her fall.

I approached her as did two older gentlemen. She was very disoriented yet not woozy, or so she claimed, until she started wobbling and had to sit down. We received some strange replies as we asked her a few questions, for instance: did she require an ambulance ("Never!"), was her arm smarting much ("Depends on what you mean, doesn't it?") and would she like some company until she'd regained composure ("You're all very nice, and I don't know my name right now, but I'll be alright, I think.").

I briskly left for Caf√© Rival and fetched water, but when I returned the lady had vanished. I hope she's well off.

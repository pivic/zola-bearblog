While not being able to sleep, I pondered some.

While [Tyra Banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyra%20Banks) is the epitome of histrionics, she suddenly made me think of [William Burroughs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20S.%20Burroughs)' "_[Spare Ass Annie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKFCfeZzjQ)_": at times, Banks behaves as though she was born with 20 rectums but now only has one and is desperately, almost constantly, trying to excrete through it, ending up with her mouth working as the auxiliary.

I'm really scared of the following picture from the beginning of [E. Elias Merhige](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.%20Elias%20Merhige)'s film "_[Begotten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begotten)_":

The Wikipedia caption says this:

> Opening scene showing "God" portrayed by an insane bandaged being who later disembowels himself.

Strangely, I don't know what scares me most: Tyra Banks or "God". Really, I'm not making this up.

I'm not merely referring to that image; when Banks first started "_[America's Next Top Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s%20Next%20Top%20Model)_", she invested herself somewhat in the contestants. Today, she turns up for a short while at the end of every episode, seemingly to play a cardboard version of that character that was there for a short while at the start of the first season. I shan't [smize](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tyraspeak) at her dry-humping her own stock, being an executive producer of the show anall.

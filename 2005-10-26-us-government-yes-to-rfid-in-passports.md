The US government has now declared that US citizens will be forced to have an RFID chip implanted in their passports. What the public says about this?

> Out of the 2335 comments on the plan that were received by the State Department this year, 98.5 percent were negative.

Well, that's nice. Go figure. There's more to be read about this, the sad encryption in the RFID-chip and how people react, in [this CNet article](http://news.com.com/Passports+to+get+RFID+chip+implants/2100-7348_3-5913644.html). [Tracking luggage](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000923065133) is one thing, individuals another.

And by the way, don't miss out on [FBI abusing the patriot act](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/26/0216234).

As MacInTouch has [surveyed the MacBook problem](http://www.appledefects.com/?p=78), they have concluded that 19% of all owners of MacBook Pro's suffer from spontaneous shutdowns. For MacBook-owners, this is about half of that. From said study:

> 19% of the 2.0 GHz 15" MacBook Pros released in March are prone to sudden, unexpected shutdown. This is a staggeringly high problem level for such a serious defect, but it fell to just half this level with the May hardware updates.
> 
> The 13" MacBooks are also affected, at 7.5% to 12%. Some survey participants speculate the problem may be related to improperly seated RAM, noting that it is very difficult to get some non-Apple RAM to seat in the expansion slots. Others point the finger at defective memory, Mac OS X software updates, or firmware issues. We just don't have enough solid information to know what the cause is.

More about the issues that have faced the MacBooks and MacBook Pro's is available [here](http://www.macintouch.com/reliability/macbooks.html), courtesy of MacInTouch.

**edit**: ars technica have also [written about all of the problems that pain the Apple Intels](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060809-7457.html).

By the way, thanks a lot for this study. It just helps to get Apple off their seats and into GTD\-mode. _Please_, pretty, please.

First, [Tom Cruise gets kicked off Paramount for being a naughty scientologist](http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1857065,00.html), just check this quote courtesy of The Guardian:

> He condemned fellow star Brooke Shields for taking drugs for postnatal depression. He demanded that a Scientology tent be erected beside the movie set of War of the Worlds. And he shouted down the US television host Matt Lauer for daring to suggest that pharmaceuticals might sometimes help treat psychological disorders.
> 
> "You don't know the history of psychiatry! I do! ... There's no such thing as a chemical imbalance in the body!" Cruise told Lauer, echoing a key doctrine of Scientology.
> 
> Founded by the science fiction writer L Ron Hubbard, Scientology views itself as waging a war with psychiatry, arguing instead that the root of human misery lies in the actions of an intergalactic ruler who arrived on earth 75 million years ago with a fleet of spaceships.

Oh, I laughed. Moahahhaa! But, like the article says, why isn't [this clown](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1014) kicked off everybody's roster?

and now...US TV gets even worse than Swedish reality-TV by modifying[a show called "Survivor" by letting it become propelled by racism](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5281220.stm) - oh, I mean _ethnicity_, to quote the producers of the show.

What fucking idiots.

I've bought a new lens for my camera! Surely that's interesting [considering the quality](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/28823298)? Don't worry, I won't bore you with details, but the pictures are fresh. They'll pop up at [my flickr place](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic) before they're incorporated into any gallery accessible through here.

Mikaela's relatives are surely not all roses about coming to Suecia; they've endured 35 degrees Celsius and blazing sun while in Madrid, and here it's appx. 20 degrees less and rain. Late yesterday afternoon rain hit Stockholm, cats-and-dogs-style. Before that I crept around all the south of Stockholm city for more than an hour, scouring Needy Greedy, which is the cheapo-outlet of [Nitty Gritty](http://www.nittygritty.se). I didn't find anything, as there was nothing to be found; the sweaters I liked were extremely small or too expensive, so I ventured to Mikaela's [yoga shala of choice](http://www.ashtangayogashala.nu) to pay her admittance to a course that [David Swenson](http://www.ashtanga.net) will lead. He seems like a really good instructor, judging from h[is DVD](https://ashtanga.secureserverdot.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16212&cat=251&page=1).

I also found that [Badlands](http://www.badlands.se) have moved next to a coffee-shop, forming some sort of shapely yuppie alliance. My only problem with Badlands is that they cannot compete with the prices that [Swedisc](http://www.swedisc.com) offer, but they do have a lot of books and music, which Swedisc does not flaunt. I shopped some at [Pet Sounds](http://www.petsounds.se), where I picked up "[1000 Record Covers](http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/books/popculture/all/facts/01872.htm)", a good collection of...record covers. Good one. I also got Brian Eno's one-year-diary-experiment, titelled "[A Year With Swollen Appendices](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0571179959)", which I read ten years ago. He's got quite the brain underneath that bald hood.

I met up with Anos when shopping for the lens, and we headed to åhléns where I got hold of some skin-creme and shaving gel. I've got to say it, gel is superior to foam. I'm a sucker for the gel and after-shave balm from Lancà´me.

I really wish I'd get the chance to see the TV episode that [this site reports of](http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2005/07/a_week_imagined.html#more); it's John Lennon and Yoko Ono jamming with Chuck Berry, and the mere description of the incident makes me laugh.

Every time the [untalkative bunny](http://bunny.23skidoo.org) has shown on MTV, I've thought of [John K.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren_and_Stimpy) every time I saw the animations, that are basically a needle in the eye of everything that MTV is, nowadays. Does that make me sound old? I wish!

I like [this charicature](http://galleryoftheabsurd.typepad.com/14) of [Dave Navarro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Navarro), not to mention the "recipe card" a bit down on the page - [kneel before Zod](http://www.generalzod.net)!

Oh, if you're into comedy (which you should, Bog save you otherwise, if you're reading this at all - are you?) get this: a very conservative senator in the USA visits The Daily Show, where Jon Stewart kills him (a little) on his views on homosexuality. It's the old kids-shouldn't-have-same-sex-parents-even-if-their-biological-parents-are-rotten-drug-and-child-abusers. Check the story and download the snippet off the show [here](http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/07/26.html#a4152).

Speaking of idiots, check [this out](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/07/26/damning_sony_payola_.html), directing you to a little question of [payola](http://www.answers.com/payola) that Sony dishes out to American radio DJ's who don't have respect, souls or bother: they're just asses not caring the least about the music, but takes money to play certain songs a certain number of times during certain hours. What bastards.

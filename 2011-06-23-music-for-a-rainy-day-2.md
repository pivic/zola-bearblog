This track murdered part of my 1980s. It's probably one of the tracks that I immensely hated, then couldn't stand singing along with, then became part of my "it's a good song, yes it is" list.

I've never gotten along with Guided by Voices, but this song just won me over from the start. The beginning reminds me of Babyshambles' "_Pipedown_". Or is it the other way around?

Speaking of winning, woo! It's Hall and Oates, the stuff that was played in little school and intimidated boys and girls everywhere as it let grind melt with bump. Also, this track is notable for being the backbone of De La Soul's "_[Say No Go](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08X5CVfL0bk)_".

[X](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com) got me into this, and I'll never get tracks like this out of my system for real.

This is the track that got me into Sonic Youth and realising that Spike Jonze is a fucking master at making videos. Note [Jason Lee](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005134) -- **hey**!

OK, more Spike Jonze. But this track is so weird and good, backwards loops not to mention the video in itself and the lyrics. "_My name is Booty Brown and I'm preceding_". Another cameo - **Ad-Rock**! **Droooop**.

Fountain of Wayne's another band I've never successfully crossed paths with, but this is the lazyface stuff that makes me like songs like Mudhoney's "_Touch Me I'm Sick_".

OK, I had to include that, too. A song that makes me remember some Austinites cutting rug in Minehead.

...and finally, a bit of ease. Yo La Tengo is a required taste and takes some listening to, and it pays off every time. Start with a compilation and marry their different tastes.

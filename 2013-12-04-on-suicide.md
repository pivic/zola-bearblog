I'm reading "[_Mind The Child_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17356891-mind-the-child)" by Camila Batmanghelidjh and the above is the first page in it. Somebody dying, at the expense of a small amount of money. Yet the loss itself, uncynically speaking, is unfathomable.

It got me thinking, while brushing my teeth. When is suicide valid, rectified, or can it ever be?

I imagine a lot of people thinking it may be, if you're in a horrible situation, like you're dying and want to lessen the time waiting to die, or you're in a position where you know you will die and, if done by yourself, death may come far less painful and prolonged, e.g. if you're a prisoner and you know that death by torture is inevitable.

All of this is, naturally, theoretical; mind-games of somebody brushing his teeth.

What about a difficult but not clearly lethal situation? Would that be OK for committing suicide? E.g. if a right-wing party took control over the country in which you live ((Which, admittedly, I don't think I know anyone who would kill themselves over; hopefully, it would make the form-a-line-please population of Sweden a bit more active.)), or if WW3 would break out?

Another way to turn this: is it ever OK to _prevent_ suicide? Of course. Some people, even most of them, I dareguess, aren't in their right state of mind when attempting suicide. They need help.

The government kills people, whether you live in one that laws the death penalty or one that, for example, sends immigrants back to certain death in their home countries. Given this, is it OK to murder yourself? Or to hide your suicide by making it look like an accident?

No solution here, only thoughts.

**edit**: more interesting, recent words on suicide are found [here](https://chronicle.com/article/Stopping-Suicide/143279/).

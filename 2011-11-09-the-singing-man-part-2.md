A little while ago [I wrote about The Singing Man](https://niklasblog.com/?p=8310). I just saw him again, and his song echoed right over the lake. He actually sings well and I don't think there's anything mentally wrong with him unless somebody proves it. He just sings and seems content with doing so.

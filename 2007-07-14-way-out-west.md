[![Way Out West](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2007-07-14-wow.jpg)](http://www.wayoutwest.se "Way Out West")

Here we go.

I knew there were some great artists coming to [Way Out West](http://www.wayoutwest.se), a music festival that's taking place in Gothenburg, Sweden, starting August 9th. ((Yeah, the 9th, [believe me](http://www.wayoutwest.se/klara-artister).))

I mean, [Primal Scream](http://www.primalscream.org), [The Go! Team](http://www.myspace.com/thegoteam), [...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead](http://www.trailofdead.com), [The Hives](http://www.hives.nu), [New Young Pony Club](http://www.wearepony.com), [Architecture In Helsinki](http://www.architectureinhelsinki.com), [Lady Sovereign](http://www.ladysovereign.com), [The Pogues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pogues) and [Spoon](http://www.spoontheband.com), to name my faves.

Damn! That list alone almost makes me think [Accelerator](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1276) will get whipped. Yep, it most probably will, but new artists have recently been unveiled. Thing is, most last-minute artists are boring has-beens or very new bands that aren't that exciting, but...

[VOXTROT](http://www.voxtrot.net)

I could/can hardly believe my fucking eyes. I jumped with excitement but I had to triple-check this in order to get a waft of reality. Yes, they're playing, it's no error. If you haven't heard their debut album "Voxtrot", already, pick it up and listen to it incessantly.

Besides, more new artists are:

[Woven Hand](http://www.wovenhand.com) [Low](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_(band)) [Franke](http://srvice.com/catalog/item.php?catno=SERV007) [The Tough Alliance](http://www.thetoughalliance.com) (so, we meet _again_...)

AAAH!

I don't know what to say. It seems this festival will kill me from over-excitement but I feel trepidatious. I must be! What if the blasted thing doesn't lift, if it doesn't happen, if [my dad decides to over-pose](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/809606385) and dies from it? I can't say. But I will say that I'd rather die trying than face the alternative.

If I die from hearing Voxtrot's "Every Day" live that's one thing; I almost wrote that I could live with that, but there you go, I'm over-excited. Fuck! Fuck! It's gotta be! It's meant to be. And I'll love it. I'll shut up now.

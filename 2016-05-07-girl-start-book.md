It's a good thing that I'm reading [Laura Bates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Bates)' new book, "[_Girl Up_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28434176-girl-up)", feeling all:

a. angry as hell b. that I'm not insane

I loved "[Everyday Sexism](https://twitter.com/everydaysexism)", both that Twitter account and [the book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21251323-everyday-sexism), and this seems to be another great book, horrid and necessary. Let's fight anti-feminism.

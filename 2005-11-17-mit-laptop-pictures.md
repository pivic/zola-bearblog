[Here](http://laptop.media.mit.edu/laptop-images.html) you'll find pictures of the MIT "$100 laptop", which [I've written about previously](https://niklasblog.com/?p=782). I really applaud this project, and commend the persons involved.

I wish I could get hold of the [MS Office 12 beta 1](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1888124,00.asp), that's just hit the beta-testers. It will be very interesting to try out (more than I already have). More about the beta-pack from [this press-release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/nov05/11-16Office12Beta1PR.mspx) off Microsoft. Some quite fresh screen-shots are available [here](http://www.eweek.com/slideshow/0,1206,l=&s=25984&a=165435,00.asp).

Every winter in Sweden is plagued by people falling ill to "the winter vomiting bug", aka the [**Norovirus**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus). I just heard somebody say that ingesting 10 whole white pepper corns would help in fending off the disease, but I believe this as much as I believe in witches. Hang on. Witches exist.

Oh, speaking of illness, last night I dreamt that I killed my dad using my Freddy Kreuger-like finger-knives on my right hand ((WHICH I DON'T USUALLY HAVE.)); I remember thinking that dad was talking far too much and that none of what he said made sense and was only vitriol, so I cut out his throat; it didn't stop him from talking, however, even through blood was pouring away. Writing about it feels _aaaah_ but in the dream, I remember that it had to be done and that it felt..._right_. Yeah.

Here are a few pics from this morning. Enjoy.

The text reads "SOUTH OF HELL" at the top and "I LOVE EVERYBODY" at the bottom. This is seen on a defaced ad on the Stockholm subway. Made me think of [this](https://niklasblog.com/?p=16650) song.

So, what's cracking at work? Nothing heard as I entered, and...

...nothing going on as I came in further. But yes, people trickled in after a while.

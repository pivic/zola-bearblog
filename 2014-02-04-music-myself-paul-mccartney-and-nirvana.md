I published this little ditty, a straight-up ((As Paula Abdul would have said.)) guitar piece that I recorded at home ((The Polar studio is such a drag.)) using a mobile phone, my beaten-up Les Paul copy and a Line6 amp.

Last night I dreamt that Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl ((I.e. the remnants of Nirvana.)) met up with Paul McCartney in a rehearsal space. The younger two asked Paul what he wanted to play and he said "This", strummed four bars and started playing Nirvana's "_Drain You_" on guitar.

By solely writing in English, Elin Kling not only devours the English language metaphorically and produces noteworthy alphabet soup, but literally; from [this page](http://stylebykling.nowmanifest.com/2011/12/24/merry-x-mas-2), dated 2011-12-24:

> Merry christmas! I hope you all will have a lovely day! Luckily I'm one of them who has a family, and actually enjoy this time of the year, and I'm very thankful for that. Christmas is amazing, but I know it's also a horrible time for many people. Sorry if I'm ruin the christmas-lovely-feeling :). I just don't want anyone of you readers to think, that you are alone to not have the perfect day, if you don't. I don't want you to browse all your favorite-blogs and read about how AMAZING everything is, and feel that you are the only one who's not having this perfect day, with the perfect gifts, you are not. Remember that it's so easy to run a blog and to only show the “perfect world“.

> Ok, all my love to you, all of you! And thank you for following me. If you want to write something here. Just whatever you feel like. Do it! Now I'm gonna eat my nephew!  

Apart from the atrocious lingo: what is she trying to say, writing "I don't want you to browse all your favorite-blogs and read about how AMAZING everything is, and feel that you are the only one who's not having this perfect day, with the perfect gifts, you are not."?

To me, reading that might feel like trying to follow "_Inception_" when completely blind. Is she telling the reader that he/she is not "having this perfect day, with the perfect gifts" or not?

Perhaps Elin Kling was trying to be nice, she may have tried to say "don't feel bad for not experiencing a perfect xmas, it's all right", but we can't really tell.

I think her post is cringe-worthy in the extreme mostly due to her (and myself) using Swedish as the mother tongue. She [used to write in both Swedish and English per post](http://stylebykling.nowmanifest.com/2010/12/24/merry-x-mas), albeit wasn't translating.

If you're using a language you don't understand, try to learn it, proof-read it before posting, have somebody to proof-read it for you or frankly just give that up and write in your native tongue instead; the blog [Hanzi Smatters](http://hanzismatter.blogspot.com) offers loads of indirect advice on why this is important.

[Google Translate is](http://hanzismatter.blogspot.com/2011/10/dr.html) [_not_](http://hanzismatter.blogspot.com/2011/10/dr.html) [sufficient](http://hanzismatter.blogspot.com/2011/10/dr.html).

And forth I venture, my English being perfect n'awl...

[![](http://images.wikia.com/logopedia/images/1/16/Melodifestivalen_symbol.png)](http://images.wikia.com/logopedia/images/1/16/Melodifestivalen_symbol.png)Of course the hosts joked around about the amateurish level of the contest last week around, but managed to top that by cautiously displaying a bottle of cleaning liquid in the "green room", where the artists collated after their performance and texted on camera.

I shan't even go into the feeble-minded joke that was the hosts' rendition of Aqua's "_Barbie Girl_" or the between-songs "comical" action.

Oh yeah, let's not forget that one of the hosts, [Marie Serneholt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie%20Serneholt)'s little "[rap](http://svtplay.se/v/2324787/marie_som_hip-hopare_-_karaokeversionen)" is completely stolen off my favourite Natalie Portman bit from SNL:

I wish [Christian Walz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian%20Walz)'s song "_[Like Suicide](http://svtplay.se/v/2324350/melodifestivalen/christian_walz_-_like_suicide)_" would have gone on in the competition, but sadly it died away. Still, it had the best lines so far:

_Suicide tonight/alright_

Shake, emos everywhere!

[Sanna Nielsen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanna%20Nielsen)'s track "_I'm In Love_" stuck in my head. Apart from atrocious paraphernalia on-stage ((Nielsen's in a neon waterlily with a spinning disc in the middle.)) which she had trouble commanding, the verse of the song is the hated step-child of the song, whereas every bit of work has gone into the chorus, where Nielsen proclaims to be in love with a smile so wide it all seems a bit weird. On the other hand, her contribution - along with a crystalish bolero topping a fugly pink dress - went on the final competition in one blow.

Speaking of which, Brolle Jr. had a song about seven days and seven days and seven days which I hoped wouldn't make it on in any way, shape or form, but of course he, his faux-1950s style and generally bad song made it forth, straight to the finals. If Elvis were alive today, his career and bad, bad styling wouldn't be what it is: a total rape. But there isn't much 1950s from a person who desperately wants to be known as a younger, sexier version of Elvis. Too bad all it serves is making him look more dead than Elvis. ((Who might be alive! /[Rusty Shacklebird](http://atlmalcontent.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/dale-gribble-eats-mushrooms-in-the-woods-ddd-screenshot-2.jpg)))

Speaking of being lost, Anniela's song "_[Elektrisk](http://svtplay.se/v/2324347/melodifestivalen/anniela_-_elektrisk)_" really made her struggle. Where Loreen, whose control and quality really impressed me, ruled her track seemingly without any noticeable effort, Anniela worked up a sweat as though her last name ended with a consonant and she was spending some time at Guantà¡namo Bay, being [waterboarded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding).

Loreen made it through, which Anniela didn't.

Speaking of which, another outcast from Swedish "Idol", Daniel Karlsson, appeared attired like [Thomas Di Leva](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1050/1054042132_02d207d327.jpg) while trying to revive the 1960s with his usual slew of kookiness. Booo-ring, emphasis on the boo. As I'm writing this I'm looking at a picture of my grandmother with a monkey in her lap, which is infinitely more entertaining than his schtick. He had all the colours of the rainbow and every vocal inflection imaginable but ended up being living proof that less is more. I hate when artists resort to yelping because they think it helps the song when it doesn't. Either learn from Morrissey or don't sing.

Next Saturday: Linköping. Eric Saade, who sang the catchiest track of last year's Melodifestival, "_Manboy_", returns. With a new track that all aged 0-12 will love? And we'll be plagued by Sebastian Karlsson, also from "Idol", fancy that!

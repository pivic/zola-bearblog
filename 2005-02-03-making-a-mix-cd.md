I've received a little mix-CD from a little bird, and its cover is made through [paper cd case](http://www.papercdcase.com), the brilliant free site to make covers through. Check the track list [here](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-02-03-record.jpg).

That little bird also told me the coming [Fischerspooner](http://www.fischerspooner.com) album is quite good so far. It's apparently more indie than electronica. "electroclash/electroclash/if I hear that word one more time I'm-a scream!" Good, they've moved on. The coming [Thievery Corporation](http://www.eslmusic.com) album, the bird says, is really good. Good trip-hop made this side of the millenium? By jove! That's right.

Soon the emergency phone will start ringing as it's Thursday, and hence, my day with the users on the phone. I'm prepared. I haven't had coffee though. The past weeks I've had a Segafredo Extra Strong every day. It's very nice. The difference between good and bad espresso is quite thin, but this coffee is really, really good.

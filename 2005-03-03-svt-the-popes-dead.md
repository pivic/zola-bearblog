A view of [this picture](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-03-03-deadpope.gif) reveals a full article \[in Swedish\] by SVT, indicating the pope died somewhere around 2005-03-03 (today) at 20:45.

SVT has since withdrawn the page from online publication, but not before I had the URL sent to me by three different people (thanks to Måns for the pictures). Investigative journalism, a publicist's nightmare or just a clairvoyant reporter who accidentally deleted the article post-post? We'll learn, soon enough! Well, for now, the [pope's not dead](http://www.cafepress.com/idioteex.17709915), but we know somebody's finger is hovering over a submit-button.

That track just about collects how joyous this weekend has been! My beloved X and I went to visit her mom and her mom's fiancée who live in a big house in Björnkärr, which is basically the countryside. They're building and building on stuff that surrounds the house where they live, and will soon have a guest-house and a place to smoke the hell out of dead animals.

We were bound for [Malmamarken](http://www.flen.se/templates/Event.aspx?id=28551), a big country fair complete with loads of people selling insane stuff, loads of people buying stuff insanely, games and of course a musical artist, this year Jay Smith, somebody who won Swedish "_Idol_" last year. But let me begin at the beginning of our trip and turn this into a photographic tale.

[![Blixa travelling](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6146/6003960821_16180e7ca7_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/6003960821) Blixa took the train-ride very well. She's a complete joy to ride with, silent as Helen Keller, as long as she's not travelling by car. She turns a bit squeaky then.

![Aaaargh!](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6009/6003962113_93ce012c6f.jpg) Imagine seeing this welcoming face as you hit a roundabout in Malmköping! JOYOUS.

![The Tick](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6123/6004508478_f74ae2ff8e.jpg) One of the first things to hit us as we entered the parking area at Malmamarken was this, some kind of inflatable rubber tick. Scary as hell!

![X's luv](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6149/6003966183_2004f0cce8_z.jpg) If only I'd bought _this_ for my beloved...

![Texas hustler](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6008/6004512672_98f319db0c.jpg) ...or this. Maybe this and then go to Texas again.

![Fair flair](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6009/6003967529_3bc00a5f2d.jpg) More of that fair flare.

We walked around quite a lot, actually buying some delicious lime honey and honey mustard! Yuuummmy! There was a lot of stuff on sale, and I gulped as I realised somebody was actually trying to sell a complete collection of "_[Nausicä Of The Valley Of The Wind](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_%28manga%29)_" for a buckload of money. You'll find it all at countryside fairs.

![Jay Smith](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6137/6004514118_d647a03ea3.jpg) Yes! **Jay Smith**! Finally, some drowsy rock that made Mötley Crüe seem interesting and not at all like jaded alcoholics! All of Smith's - or in fact, to quote their poster, von Benzo and Jay Smith - poses and growls and the band's "melodic release" blended in and sounded the same. Boring, boring stuff. The band looked like they could care less.

As Smith finally growled into his popular cover of Madonna's "_Like A Prayer_", people started waking up. Ironically this was the freshest bit of his repertoire.

To quote [X](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com): "Do you think _this_ is what he intended as he won 'Idol'?"

Still, there was a crowd of tweeners on the right-hand side of the stage, queuing for drugs autographs:

After this we sauntered out of the fair, all happy and content. Even met X's brother Marcus at the place.

The Sörmland sky was exquisite. This simple photo can't do the real thing justice. It was dreamy drenched in shades of pink, orange and purple, all intertwined as birds passed.

We'd bought some old-fashioned chocolate balls which were perfect. Even lasted till the day after, if you can believe it. Put me in the same room as candy...

We sat outdoors and grilled marshmallows, something I'll forever be grateful to X for. Downed the marshmallows with rosé wine and had a lovely, sweet evening with a little bat circling overhead.

Thomas and Ulrika have cows!

Yes, we did photograph them.

Ullis made terrific foods during all of our stay, for instance this great pie:

Despite of that and her best efforts, Blixa just had to attack:

All in all: brilliant. The weekend really calmed me down - just before turning me sick which meant I had to stay home Monday and yesterday. Can't wait until we're visiting Björnkärr again - this Friday! YEAY!

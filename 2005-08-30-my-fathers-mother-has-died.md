From my dear brother Zoka:

> This morning she woke up, and sat in her chair and past away...sad, but in a way, if it's a comfort, she's gone without suffering.

Dad's going to Serbia in a few hours, and will make it to the burial tomorrow, at 13:00. He and I planned to go to Serbia in the winter, where he hoped he would meet his mother at least once more during his life-time. She passed away without any suffering, which is an alleviating thought.

I love you, baka, and I always have.

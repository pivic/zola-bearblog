[Gaahl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaahl) is the front-man of black metal project Gorgoroth. In the following clip, from documentary "[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal%3A%20A%20Headbanger%27s%20Journey)", where Gaahl looks incredibly tense and funny, he's asked what primarily fuels Gorgoroth's music.

His answer might very well be the most pretentious (and wooden) answer in music history.

I just found [Media Portal](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mediaportal), a SourceForge project for MS Windows, which is completely free of charge. The program creates what its name implies: a media portal. Through this program, the idea is you'll watch your pictures, music, video and lots of other things. It contains a lot of plug-ins (e.g. Tetris and MS Messenger) and the TV portion allows the user to plug in a TV card, which in turn means it'll help you record everything you can show through your TV cable. Do do this, it allows you to (quite) automatically download TV channel guides. I tried it for Sweden, and it works. Brilliant.

It reminds me a whole lot of Microsoft's Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, yet Media Portal is 1) free and 2) a lot more configurable. [Here](http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=107397) are a bunch of screen-shots of the program, and remember you can configure it to use different skins. Note that I haven't recorded anything through it yet, due to my not owning a TV card. On the other hand...

Next month I plan on buying a [Hauppauge USB 2.0 TV card](http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/products/data_pvrusb2.html). That sucker and a USB 2.0 card will have me one up on our VCR. Brilliant!

Today is horrid. It's been raining since late last night and today, as I was making my way up Medborgarplatsen's subway station I coughed up things green and yellow; 'tis a good thing, though. I think it's symbolic for my ills taking a turn for the road. I'll turn healthy soon.

But even though this isn't Denmark, things are quirky. And extremely weird. I just experienced the following when a handiman turned up in my office looking like [Kevin Rowland in the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW_aWY5PubI) for "_Come On Eileen_ ((OK, sans beret, plus long-sleeved shirt, thank Bog.))":

he: But, there's no water here! I: Excuse me? h: Are you the one clamining there's water here? I: Apparently not. What do you want? h: I'm looking for water. I: \[points out the window\] h: But is it too much? I: \[gawks in utter amazement\] h: It's not full! Are you allergic? I: Yes, to furry animals. h: But not to this? \[signals towards the rain outside the window\] I: No. I stand water well. h: \[leaves\]

I wish I were making this up. Please, day, turn 'round.

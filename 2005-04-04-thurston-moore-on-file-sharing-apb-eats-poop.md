Thurston Moore writes about why he likes file-sharing as a way of sharing music, and how the technique has essentially been around forever, [here](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.04/play.html?pg=3) \[Wired\]. Excerpt:

> These days, CD technology has displaced the cassette in the mainstream, and mix CDs have become the new cultural love letter/trading post. For those of us who think that digital delivers a harsher sound than analog, it's a sonic nightmare dealing with the new world reality of MP3s. They're even more compressed and harsh than CDs, and in the case of vintage grooves - be it Led Zeppelin, Bad Brains, or Pavement - sound even more detached from musical vibration.
> 
> But even if MP3 music sounds lame, as long as it's recognizable in form, free, and shareable, it's here to stay. It will get better as more sophisticated methods of replication emerge. For now, its clunk is glamorized by celebrity iTunes playlists. ITunes has become the Hallmark card of mix tapes - all you gotta do is sign your name to personalize it.

APB, the Swedish anti-piracy bureau (which is nothing more than a lobbyist organisation, in no way supported by the Swedish government), has now dropped all of its charges against Bahnhof, a Swedish ISP accused by APB to have hoarded warez. Trouble was, as I've written about previously, [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=539), it seems APB used an agent to plant evidence needed at Bahnhof. Thus ends that lead, and APB seems more like a joke organisation than ever, now bearing no credibility. Note: the APB site is still down since a few weeks back, having been hacked to pieces.

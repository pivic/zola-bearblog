Links galore.

You need 80's videos? [Here](http://www.worksafevideos.com/music_videos)'s a list of more than 1400 of them.

Uwe Boll, director of films such as "[BloodRayne](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383222)" and "[Alone In The Dark](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369226)", is [challenging his critics to fight him in the ring](http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1801615,00.html) - and then use that footage in his coming film, "[Postal](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486640)". **Edit**: Rich "Lowtax" Kyanka [made the list](http://www.somethingawful.com/index.php?a=3883)!

Speaking of films, [here](http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/cheers.htm)'s a list of the 100 most influential films and [here](http://www.boardsmag.com/screeningroom/commercials/2971)'s a mad American commercial \[streaming QT\].

[Here](http://users.utu.fi/ljtaim/ubuntuosx.php)'s a guide to get your [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) looking like [OSX](http://www.apple.com/macosx).

Writing on Ubuntu, [here](http://maconstuff.blogspot.com/2006/06/how-to-run-windows-xp-under-ubuntu.html)'s a great guide I've just followed to make WinXP run under Ubuntu, and it's not VMWare, it's [QEMU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU), which is free.

[Quick SMS](http://www.mutube.com/wordpress/quick-sms) is a plugin for WordPress, enabling people to send an SMS to a number defined by yourself; note that your provider must be listed by the creator of the plugin in order for it to work on your site. I've notified the creator of Tele2, a Swedish provider that allows e-mails to a certain address to be forwarded as an SMS. Interesting plugin, yet I wonder how spam-friendly it would be.

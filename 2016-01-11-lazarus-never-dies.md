He's within us, around us, inspiring us.

What a fucking freak he was. The grandfather freak, in a way. He loved Burroughs. Morrissey loved Bowie. There's so much inspiration about all of Bowie's styles, creations, films, music. It's a harrowing. Still, like he sang in "Lazarus", which the above video was released for on Friday, when Bowie's new album was released:

_Oh, I'll be free Just like that bluebird Oh, I'll be free Ain't that just like me?_

I'll turn this day around yet, and celebrate who he was.

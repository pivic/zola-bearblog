Well, well, well...

My dear friend [Zak and I](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cyndamoore/2339761353/) have since long discussed making our own respective [UTI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Influence_%28compilation_album%29)'s, i.e. compilations where we list the tracks that have influenced us the most over the years. Safe to say, for a music fanatic like [Zak](http://zakdaddys.blogspot.com) it's hard to compile something as insufficient as one single CD to show the world what has influenced you; of course, that's why he came up with the 1.0-moniker, clever bastard! Even though I wish I'd have beaten my dear friend to the punch with a UTI-compilation of my own, I'm getting close to my own 1.0. I've compiled a lot of tracks, e.g.

> Mantronix - King Of The Beats Madonna - Cherish Public Image Ltd. - Public Image Ltd. The Prodigy - 1-2-3 Music Reach Dusty Springfield - I Don't Wanna Hear It Anymore Dinosaur Jr. - Sludgefest Morrissey - Speedway Donna Summer - I Feel Love

On one hand, I must stop obsessing over which tracks to include where, and instead just let it pour out, because those tracks did; they came (and continue to come) to me randomly yet chronologically, over decades. When compiling my UTI I won't care about chronology, only about what track blends well with the others in order, and how the album feels as a whole; of course, this is quite complicated if not altogether impossible. Putting [Atari Teenage Riot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Teenage_Riot) next to [Sena Jurinac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sena_Jurinac) would perhaps just seem too contrived.

Oh, damn it. I'll give myself a couple of weeks and then publish the results off my head. I've gotta do this some time, and Zak's pushed me over the edge.

What tracks have influenced _you_ the most?

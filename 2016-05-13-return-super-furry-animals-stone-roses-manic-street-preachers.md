OK.

**SFA OK.**

Yesterday, **The Stone Roses** released [a new song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0XZ9qjMil8), their first new material in 21 years. Conclusion: it's no fun.

Today, **Super Furry Animals** release their new song, "_[Bing Bong](https://superfurry.backstreetmerch.com/t-shirts/bing-bong-bundle-t-shirt-immediate-mp3-download)_", the first new material in 7 years.

_[Gorau Chwarae Cyd Chwarae](http://www.faw.cymru/news/The-Message-on-our-Chest/96750/)_, indeed.

Obviously, SFA have released that in time for the forthcoming footy championships.

They're more low-key than **Manic Street Preachers**, who yesterday released their Welsh national team song, named "_Together Stronger (C'mon Wales)_", which is actually also pretty catchy:

Here's what James said about it ((in [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/12/manic-street-preachers-release-their-euro-2016-song-together-stronger).)):

> “Nick \[Wire\] had written lyrics for a song during previous campaigns, but of course, they’d all bitten the dust,” singer James Dean Bradfield told Wales Online. “It was the Belgium home game where the cogs in Nick’s head started whirring when we knew it was game on and we had a great chance of qualifying.”
> 
> He added: “You always wonder if you can actually pull off a football song, because let’s face it there have been so many bad ones out there. We’ve got to admit that the benchmarks are Three Lions and World In Motion – they are two great football songs.”

All hail SFA. The Manics are good. The Roses are currently in a sad state of affairs. I'm actually, really holding my fingers crossed for SFA to release more.

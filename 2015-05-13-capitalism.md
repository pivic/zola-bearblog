From **Noam Chomsky**'s "_[On Anarchism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25335127-on-anarchism)_":

> If capital is privately controlled, then people are going to have to rent themselves in order to survive. Now, you can say, “they rent themselves freely, it’s a free contract”—but that’s a joke. If your choice is, “do what I tell you or starve,” that’s not a choice—it’s in fact what was commonly referred to as wage slavery in more civilized times, like the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for example.

From **M.J. Carter**'s "_[The Infidel Stain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25136563-the-infidel-stain)_":

> Angry red suffused his cheeks again.
> 
> ‘It’s all changing in printing. Holywell Street is the end of something. Printers don’t set up on their own any more, masters in their own shop. It’s all big works and steam presses, a few masters revelling in wealth and luxury served by men who once worked for themselves. Woundy’s printers are nothing more than wage slaves. He takes plenty on, but he’s forced down wages and he demands longer hours. And if you won’t do them, there’s plenty who’ll take your place. It’s the same all over. Tailors, stonemasons, furniture makers. The weavers over in Spitalfields, they’re starving.’

> ‘You sound like a Chartist,’ I said.
> 
> ‘I am a Chartist, signed and sealed!’ He almost shouted it, and a number of passers-by looked round.
> 
> ‘Live it and breathe it. From where I stand, the rich have but one goal. To keep their wealth and their privileges, to grind down the poor and to keep them poor. We must fight back. But I wouldn’t expect you to understand. And now I’m going. I’ve a meeting to attend.’

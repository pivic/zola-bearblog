A few weird things have happened to me today, making me feel a little like [Tom Cruise](http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2005/06/27/cruise/index_np.html); yeah, I'm referring to craziness, including that crap new version of "War Of The Worlds", that Mikaela and I paid hard money to see, yesterday. Argh! Don't see it, ever.

I woke up this morning, remembering two dreams.

**1**. I played acoustic guitar (nylons only) live with Morrissey and his band. Everything went so well that Boz miked my guitar, so that the audience could hear me as well, and I was nervous as hell. I can't remember which songs we played, apart from "[Such A Little Thing Makes Such A Big Difference](http://www.lyricsdepot.com/morrissey/such-a-little-thing-makes-such-a-big-difference.html)".

**2**. Post-gig, I visited my parents' house, only to find my dad talking to Jessica, one of my sister's oldest friends. I also found my Nikon D70 there, and when I lifted it up, the lens fell out and smashed against the floor. A lot of sand started running out from the camera, and I felt I wanted to kill the person responsible. I found out it was Jessica, as she confessed without hesitation. She wasn't too bothered, but neither was my dad:

dad: Well, it can be mended, no big deal! me: How can you say that? You have no idea of what it takes to mend it and neither do I, but I sure as hell know I can't take any pictures with this pap. d: Well...just dust it off. m: That won't do, dad! Please! d: You can do it, son, it's just a little dust!

And so it went for appx. five minutes, until I woke up, safe in the knowledge that my camera was destroyed. But it wasn't. Sweet!

Something that is destroyed, however, is [a lot of Londoners' feeling that they're safe](http://www.flickr.com/photos/malone/24236423). A bus has been bombed, six explosions have happened in the London area and the entire subway system has been stopped, which is unprecendented. Check [this Guardian article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/transport/Story/0,2763,1523084,00.html) to know more. I really hope this [doesn't push Great Britain into the hands of the USA](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/24255117) (if they're at all able to, seeing how Blair loves Dubya's politics since way back). Of course, I wish the best for the people affected by this trauma in any way.

Right after that, I checked a few mails, and discovered a real act of altruism: [naGEEK](http://www-us.flickr.com/photos/arsblog) of [flickr](http://www.flickr.com) has given me a [flickr Pro account](http://www-us.flickr.com/upgrade)! Jaysis! [I've thanked him](http://www-us.flickr.com/photos/pivic/24223268) a little. It also seems flickr is [mid-move from Canada to the USA](http://www-us.flickr.com/help.gne#94), judging from the URL's and from the intermittent downtimes.

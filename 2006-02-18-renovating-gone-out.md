[![A nice way to store coffee](http://static.flickr.com/27/101140117_7ebd7bf58d_m.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?show=recent&photo=101140117)It's nice to start the day with a little renovating. Mikaela picked up this piece from IKEA, painted it twice and now we've got a good place to store coffee-pods in.

Yesterday I went out with Andreas, which was really meant to be a coffee-and-biscuit kind of meet, but we went out and yet took it easy. First we went to a pizza place near my work, then to a little inn near Mariatorget, then to Bishop's Arms again. Jaysis. Their ESB is really good.

While Andreas went home I was making plans to meet Mikaela's brothers, who were all on their way out for beers, which was especially noticeable due to Alexander making his debut out on the town as he recently turned 18 (which is the legal limit in Sweden, for imbibing alcohol at places where that's sold). Two problems arose: 1) they (together with some mates, of which three were 18 years old) went out at midnight; this is not a good idea when being young and going out in Stockholm, where most clubs close at 03:00 during week-ends. 2) my mobile phone said "Unable to answer the call" despite my restarting it, which is one of the deals with having a mobile phone that's built on Windows.

Now: more laziness. I'm so laazy.

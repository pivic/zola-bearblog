As [Swedisc](http://swedisc.com) is having a sale (note: not all items found on the list are actually for sale as the proprietors are slow at updating their lists) so I picked [these up](https://niklasblog.com/images/2004-05-19-DVD.jpg). I've seen "Blood In, Blood Out" appx. 10 times, without exaggerating.

I bought the Nas DVD as it was extra cheap. I just downloaded "[Illmatic](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDSUB040312261145551591&sql=Argke4j172way)", which is actually turning out to be really good, despite the fact that I've listened to it before and dissed it. Well, I recently experienced the same thing with Jay-Z, so here we go. :) Jesper will laugh heartily when he reads this.

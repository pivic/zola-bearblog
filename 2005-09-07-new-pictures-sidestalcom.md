Today I took [this gallery of pictures](http://www.niklasblog.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=284) while having lunch at Fatbursparken, which is a little park near Medborgarplatsen. It's always interesting to take pictures of people. The great advantage of snapping people isn't doing it at maximum zoom with my 70-300m lens, but that a digital SLR-camera allows you to take a great number of pictures in continuous mode, which means that when people who are used to normal little digital cameras, snapping pictures of them at a slow speed, get shot using my camera, they are tense by the time the first picture is shot, then immediately let down their guard, then the second and third pictures fall perfect. The second's relaxed, and if the person's very tense, the third picture's almost always a little frightened. So, I delete the first one, keep the second one and the third one can be very fun. Then you re-do the technique, some times with more pictures, some times with just one - there's not a formula to this. How can one compose a formula devised to capture a good picture? OK, triggered shots, shutter shots, nature shots. Those are often extremely boring though, unless you're into techy pictures where somebody's used a very special lens in a very special way, but I'd mostly prefer somebody using a mobile phone-camera to that, nine times out of...a hundred.

Speaking of photographs, Jesper's got a nephew, who's not a photographer, but a model. He's grown up in Sweden, and is working in Brazil since a couple of years back. He's getting more and more successful, so do check [his model site](http://www.sidestal.com) out.

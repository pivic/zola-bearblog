You know those film adverts, where a male speaker voice sounds completely fictive and dark, rumbling and growling? Like in adverts for hamburgers or anything other that is supposed to be "manly"? [This film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433362/) is like that voice. There is some good cinematography allowed into this film, but it's hollow in its entirety: vampires rule Earth, farm humans for blood yet starve. Only a few humans exist. [Ethan Hawke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan%20Hawke) plays a hematologist whose brother is gung-ho. Hawke likes humans, his brother doesn't. [Willem Dafoe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem%20Dafoe) is part of the human resistance. The vampires are bad. The humans resist. The dialogue makes me think the directors - two brothers - wrote it; let me check; yes, they did. Tempo's screwed-up. Nothing's really interesting. Holloooow. Boring. Soundtrack's [Wagner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard%20Wagner)\-ish and crappy. All in all: a fairly good-looking vampire-film, but I may be saying that because it sucks (pun intended) in every other aspect. Don't see it.

I really wanted this to be good. But the sheer amount of tawdriness just collated and sucked the blood - I can't help myself - out of this film. I mean, Ethan Hawke's character going by car to a strange location and there stands a woman, alone, on a field, with a crossbow in hand. Car approaching. Boredom setting in. Clichéd mood having set in (what seems like ages ago). Yawn. Back to the drawing-board for those directors, apparently just cashing in on the entire vampire-o-rama that follows in the trail of "Twilight".

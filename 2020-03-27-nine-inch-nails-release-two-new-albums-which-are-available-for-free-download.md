Nice! [Nine Inch Nails have just released two new albums](https://www.nin.com/nine-inch-nails-ghosts-v-vi-available-now/) for [download](https://nin.lnk.to/GhostsDownload) and [streaming](https://nin.lnk.to/GhostsYT).

I enjoyed the first albums in [their _Ghosts_ series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_I%E2%80%93IV). The albums provided for both pensive or ambient listening, unlike Nine Inch Nails's soundtracks, e.g. _The Social Network_ and _The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo._

> Music – whether listening to it, thinking about it or creating it – has always been the thing that helped us get through anything – good or bad. With that in mind, we decided to burn the midnight oil and complete these new _Ghosts_ records as a means of staying somewhat sane.
> 
> _Ghosts V: Together_ is for when things seem like it might all be okay, and ghosts vi: locusts… well, you’ll figure it out.
> 
> It made us feel better to make these and it feels good to share them. Music has always had a way of making us feel a little less alone in the world… and hopefully it does for you, too. Remember, everyone is in this thing together and this too shall pass.

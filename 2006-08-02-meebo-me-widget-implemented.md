[Meebo](http://meebo.com), my fave chat-through-the-web-site, has just released a widget through [Meebo Me](http://www.meebome.com), which means that anybody who's registered (for free) through them can implement a (or, actually, many a) widget through their site, allowing people who don't have an instant messaging-client to message those who do, through a simple web-site.

I have just chucked one into my site. Scroll down a bit and check the right-hand side. You can now even make up an alias and insult me without worrying about assaults, but on the other hand you _could_ be nice and say hi. Nice feature, we'll just see how it turns out.

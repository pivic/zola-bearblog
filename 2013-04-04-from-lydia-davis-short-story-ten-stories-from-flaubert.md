Culled from the short-story collection named "_[Object Lessons: The Paris Review Presents the Art of the Short Story](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13167173-object-lessons)_":

> Last week I went to the dentist, thinking he was going to pull my tooth. He said it would be better to wait and see if the pain subsided.
> 
> Well, the pain did not subside—I was in agony and running a fever. So yesterday I went to have it pulled. On my way to see him, I had to cross the old market-place where they used to execute people, not so long ago. I remembered that when I was only six or seven years old-returning home from school one day, I crossed the square after an execution had taken place. The guillotine was there. I saw fresh blood on the paving stones. They were carrying away the basket.
> 
> Last night I thought about how I had entered the square on my way to the dentist dreading what was about to happen to me, and how, in the same way, those people condemned to death also used to enter that square dreading what was about to happen to them—though it was worse for them.
> 
> When I fell asleep I dreamed about the guillotine; the strange thing was that my little niece, who sleeps downstairs, also dreamed about a guillotine, though I hadn't said anything to her about it. I wonder if thoughts are fluid, and flow downward, from one person to another, within the same house.

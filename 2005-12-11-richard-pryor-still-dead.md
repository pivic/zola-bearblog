Despite his site reading "Welcome to the Official Website of the funniest man alive" with a caption saying "I ain't dead yet M\*therF@ck%r!!", he's dead. Yeah, still, despite the "Contact Richard" bit where one can e-mail him, saying he's dead.

The man is a legend. A supreme force in stand-up-comedy, taking things where no black comedian had previously been able to (no, not even Red Foxx), despite his "foul language", both on the stage and TV/film. Fuck that. The man could do anything despite what was in his face. He's in my top three list of the best stand-up-comedians ever, and he'll forever be remembered by people who care about comedy.

Go get "[...And It's Deep Too! The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings (1968-1992)](http://www.rhino.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=76655)" and have a really good holiday. More on that box, [here](http://www.rhino.com/rzine/StoryKeeper.lasso?StoryID=66).

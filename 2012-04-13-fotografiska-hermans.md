Grabbed X by the arm and off we went to [Fotografiska](http://fotografiska.eu) on Wednesday:

[Corbijn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Corbijn)! I had heard some advance rumors that [the exhibition](http://fotografiska.eu/Museet/Utstaellningar/Inwards-and-Onwards) wasn't The Shit - which I reluctantly agree with - but it was great seeing some imagery. Patti Smith. Doesn't she kind of always look the same? Like a very photogenic scarecrow type-of person. But there were some quite uninteresting pics there, that I'd love to have exchanged for some of... I don't know, some of his old ones?

I did, however, love [the pic of Alexander McQueen](http://stockholminfullglory.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/alexander-mcqueen-london-2007_fg700wider.jpg?w=490&h=490) and I loathe [the one of Damien Hirst](http://fotografiska.eu/var/fgrafiska/storage/images/media/images/artist-talk_anton-corbijn_22/548778-1-swe-SE/artist-talk_anton-corbijn_2.jpg).

[Marcus Bleasdale](http://www.marcusbleasdale.com)'s photography of the LRA was breathtaking. [Here](http://www.hrw.org/en/video/2009/02/10/chaos-congo)'s a slideshow from Congo. He's also done short films:

While at a Corbijn exhibition loads of years ago, where more well-known pics were strewn, like the Depeche Mode Violator rose. I liked that. But still, one has to evolve.

All of a sudden: Podel! A mate's dad, and a friend in his own right, was photographed some day back in the 1980s and showed up there next to the likes of Iggy Pop and U2.

Bought a couple of notebooks just before we left.

The lamp-post closest to Fotografiska outside had been smothered with stickers that used to indicate that you were a paying visitor.

The view from up the hill, facing a harbour and the heart of the south of Stockholm city.

Fire, en route to [Herman's](http://www.hermans.se), a great veggie buffet place.

The vegetarian buffet is _ace_.

A lovely day.

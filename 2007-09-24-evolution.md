I never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd feel like this, but now it is: the ability to feel completely calm even though there's a storm around me, knowing it will pass simply by completely relying on another person's words.

For me, this is wonderful and completely based on (and here as the consequence of) honesty, love, warmth and friendship.

Speaking of said storm, my iPod randomly picked and played The Smiths' song "[Accept Yourself](http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/the_smiths/accept_yourself.html)" for me this morning just as I was thinking about the matter; I instantly thought of a certain person as I heard the following lines, as though they could have been uttered by that very somebody, if that person were more conscious regarding actions:

> Others conquered love - but I ran I sat in my room and I drew up a plan but plans can fall through as so often they do and time is against me now

Oh, lyrics do bite the ass (that I somewhat would love to expose to you).

I know I sound harsh and angry, but I'm not. I'm hoping for the best - I really, really am - albeit not for you, but for my dearest friend, confidante and love. On your part, I hope things work out, but you'll have to work on it.

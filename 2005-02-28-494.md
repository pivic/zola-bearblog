[![Winter\'s here yet again.](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-02-28-winter-thumb.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-02-28-winter.jpg)Yes people, it's an effing blizzard out there. I took this picture appx. 15 minutes ago, and already the weather's fine. I'm thinking about leaving soon, and as I hit the street I'm sure the snow will be waiting for me in legion.

I just got a link to [Query Letters I Love](http://queryletters.blogspot.com), a blog where mad people's query letters are posted. [Here](http://www.poewar.com/archives/2004/10/24/how-to-write-a-query-letter) you'll find info on what exactly a query letter does. The blog contains a few really moronic ones, e.g. one saying "For more details / full screenplay / Word2000 floppy please contact ..." to which the editor equivocally types "_Who the fuck sends out FLOPPY DISCS anymore? 1987 calling!_"

I've also read that [Halle Berry just accepted a Razzie award](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/27/halle_berry_accepts_.html), i.e. a form anti-Oscar, for "best actress", calling the film that earned her the award in question ("[Catwoman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327554)") a "piece of shit". Well, she's probably right but somehow I get the feeling she's not played her part well. I haven't seen "[Monster's Ball](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285742)" yet but people say it's good. I have, however, seen her in "[Swordfish](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244244)" (one of the greatest video-atrocities of modern time) and "[X-Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903)", that also was an equivalent of booting your own head off: incredible _and_ moronic.

Soon I'll be off to get hold of "[SingStar 2: Party](http://www.singstargame.com/en_GB/home.html)". It's a karaoke party game for the PS2, with duet support, i.e. two mics! It'll be real fun, and there are a lot of great songs available.

By no way, I have to share [this](http://www.toey.de/link.php?id=3501) badly Photoshopped picture with you. I hated it until I caught eye of the moron on the screen. Then I understood the kitty.

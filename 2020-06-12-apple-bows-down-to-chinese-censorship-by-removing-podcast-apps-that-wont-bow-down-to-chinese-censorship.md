Remember the other day when [Zoom bowed to Chinese authorities that asked them to shut down user accounts](https://niklasblog.com/?p=24918)?

Well, now Apple has gone the same route:

> [Apple](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple) has removed two podcast apps from its Chinese app store, following government pressure to censor content.
> 
> Pocket Casts and Castro were both pulled from distribution in China after the Cyberspace Administration of [China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/china) (CAC) demanded that the apps stop allowing content that breached the country’s restrictive speech laws.
> 
> “We believe podcasting is and should remain an open medium, free of government censorship,” Pocket Casts said. “As such we won’t be censoring podcast content at their request.

An equivalent of removing the apps from Apple's store because they convey data from _all_ kinds of podcasts would be to remove [Tim Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook)'s mouth from his body as it could possibly say bad things about China.

Apple. Remember this?

I guess their stance on ethics is about as correct as their grammar; _think differently_ is the correct term.

Anyway: fuck you, Apple, until you stop obeying a dictatorship. I surmise that you bow down to China just because you make your phones cheaply there and want to keep doing so. If that's correct: think differently about how you're fucking humanity.

Just as I was thinking about checking out some music from a genre I haven't visited in ages - namely [gabber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabber) - I found [this vinyl](http://www.cargorecords.co.uk/release_zoom.php?item=3282&tab=1) with six tracks on it. They are:

1\. My Gums Bleed For This Type Of Shit 2. Gravedancer 3. Crippled 4. Werewolf Syndrome Destroyed Your Family 5. Dirtbox 6. Bolt On And Jack Off

I laughed. Hard. I have no idea what the music sounds like, but some of those titles kill me. #4's my fave. I keep trying to imagine the scene.

Don't miss out on the album art that makes [Factory records](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_Records) look like [GG Allin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GG_Allin).

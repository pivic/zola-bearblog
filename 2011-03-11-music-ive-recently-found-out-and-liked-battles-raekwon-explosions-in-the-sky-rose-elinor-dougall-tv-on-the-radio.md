Although Britney Spears shocked me twice yesterday - first by hearing how much her latest single, "_[Till the World Ends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Till%20the%20World%20Ends)_", is and secondly by said song having been co-written by [Kesha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesha) - there is still good music being produced. So here's some I've found of late and liked a lot!

I've never really been into [Battles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles%20%28band%29), but their latest track makes my experimental side rock and roll.

[Raekwon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raekwon)'s new album - "**[Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin%20vs.%20Wu-Tang)**" - is even better; apart from a magnificent duet with [Method Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method%20Man), there are a whole lot of good tracks, and I currently even think it's better than "**[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only%20Built%204%20Cuban%20Linx%20II)**".

[Explosions In The Sky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosions%20in%20the%20Sky), those American experimentalists and frequent users of reverb and guitars, are due with a new album, called "**[Take Care, Take Care, Take Care](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take%20Care%2C%20Take%20Care%2C%20Take%20Care)**", before hitting the summer festival circuit. I hope it's as good as their "**[The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Earth%20Is%20Not%20a%20Cold%20Dead%20Place)**".

[Rose Elinor Dougall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose%20Elinor%20Dougall), formerly with brilliant [The Pipettes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Pipettes) ((Which are today picked-apart, broken and their second, latest album is plainly bad.)), has now gone on with her solo career. So far, it's resulted in a largely underestimated album called "**[Without Why](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14581-without-why/)**" which has some really good tracks on it, notably the newly re-recorded and re-released "_[Stop/Start/Synchro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHDYzPCfo-Q)_".

[TV On The Radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV%20on%20the%20Radio) are due with their new album, "**[Nine Types of Light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine%20Types%20of%20Light)**". Here's a track that you can download through their site, and it makes for a heavy listen.

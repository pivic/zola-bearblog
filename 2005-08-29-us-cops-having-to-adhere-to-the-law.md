[Straight outta BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/08/26/cops_have_to_pay_41k.html) this is great news unlike the military-styled illegal attack by police in Utah, which I've written about [here](https://niklasblog.com/?p=740). On this case, however:

> Last month a federal judge awarded $35,000 in compensatory and $6000 in punitive damages to a man state troopers arrested for video taping them.

Ha! Read it and laugh. Stand up for your rights!

I've been doing sit- and push-ups since a few weeks back, and the changes are showing a bit. My triceps are more evident than my biceps, and I've gained stomach muscles I never thought I'd have. I'm NOT Mr. f-ing olympia even though [I sometimes feel as smart as Arnie](http://www.gopconvention.com/cgi-data/speeches/files/2jl158h8hr9cm5t7e4d379jp6o186680.shtml). He's so smart. I wonder if he can stand up and bark on republican command.

Anyway, I'm very tired in my arms. And it feels good! Gawd, don't turn me into a health freak.

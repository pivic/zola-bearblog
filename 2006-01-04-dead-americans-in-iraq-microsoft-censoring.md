As most of the American soldiers who are part of the current invasion of Iraq aren't old enough to have been born during the American invasion of Vietnam, it's clearly interesting to see [this page](http://cryptome.org/mil-dead-iqw.htm) where data from the US military has been assembled to show statistics of the number of dead Americans during the latest invasion of Iraq.

Of course, assembling a similar list displaying statistics over how many Iraqis who have died during the latest American invasion of Iraq would require much disk space, much bandwidth and result in heavy database loads.

Said site also displays [this page](http://cryptome.net/dead/dead-gallery.htm), where pictures of many of the dead (mostly young) Americans are to be found. Don't worry, the pictures display pictures of the faces of the deceased, while they were alive. Too bad all those coloured people aren't as well-represented in, say, the American government.

[Microsoft are taking their censorship to the same levels as the Chinese government](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/03/outspoken_chinese_bl.html), by shutting down a Chinese blogger who was critical against the Chinese government. From BoingBoing: "Note, his blog was TAKEN DOWN by MSN people. Not blocked by the Chinese government." Read more about that by clicking the link.

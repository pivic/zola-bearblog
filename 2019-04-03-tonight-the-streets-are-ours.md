I love this video. The images match [Richard Hawley](http://www.richardhawley.co.uk/)'s beautiful song perfectly. This is, by the way, the introduction to a documentary about Banksy. It's _[Exit Through The Gift Shop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_Through_the_Gift_Shop)_.

\[Verse 1\]  
Do you know why you've got feelings in your heart  
Don't let fear of feeling fool you  
What you see sets you apart  
And there's nothing here to bind you  
It's no way for life to start

\[Hook\]  
But do you know that  
Tonight - the streets are ours  
Tonight - the streets are ours  
And these lights in our hearts they tell no lies

Those people, they got nothing in their souls  
And they make our TVs blind us  
From our vision and our goals  
Oh the trigger of time it tricks you  
So you have no way to grow

\[Hook\]  
But do you know that  
Tonight - the streets are ours  
Tonight - the streets are ours  
And these lights in our hearts they tell no lies

\[Verse 2\]  
And no one else can haunt me  
The way that you can haunt me  
I need to know you want me  
I couldn't be without you  
And the light that shines around you  
No, nothing ever mattered more than not doubting  
But tonight the streets are ours

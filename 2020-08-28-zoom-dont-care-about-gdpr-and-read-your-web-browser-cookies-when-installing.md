[This article](https://www.threatspike.com/blog/zoom_cookies.html) was posted yesterday. From it:

> The surprising thing comes when a user tries to uninstall the Zoom client from a Windows machine. The file install.exe is seen accessing the user's Chrome Cookies file and reading parts of the file that do not contain Zoom related information.

Apart from reading existing cookies (not by Zoom) they write new cookies that have no expiration date; well, one or two have an expiration date that is set **ten years from the installation date**.

Again, from the article:

> Keeping track of users activity on the internet is not bad in itself. However, the average users will not dig much deeper into the meaning of the “Accept all cookies” button they see so often. It is, therefore, companies’ responsibility to respect what is recommended by pieces of legislation such as the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR and ensure that everyone has a fair experience on the Internet.

> Findings like this one make you question the integrity of widely used online services in the protection of user’s data and their privacy.

Zoom are continuing to fuck up. Congratulations, Zoom.

Let's all use privacy-decent tools instead, e.g. [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/).

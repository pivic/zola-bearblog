**Question 1**: should we stop joking on April 1?

When my family was bombed the fuck out of former Yugoslavia, dark humour ruled their lives and made things better in the midst of it all.  
  
Same with Vonnegut, except he also had a lot of optimism and absolutely illuminating things to say about life.

It is my firm belief that humour is _always_ needed. Just don't be a dick, and make jokes to light some solipsistic fire in yourself and only yourself.

**Question 2**: are we facing end time?

I've actually seen a person who I know ask this on Facebook.

To paraphrase Michael Stipe: consider these [deadly examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll):

- [Millions of people have died in Congo after WW2](https://niklasblog.com/?p=3023) and [conflicts are ongoing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kivu_conflict)
- At least a million people have died in [the Afghanistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan_conflict_(1978%E2%80%93present))
- The Syrian civil war has led to [more than half a million people dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War) (so far)
- Palestine, a de jure state, has been and still is under attack and annexation from Israel for decades

This, too, will pass.

It will take time and perseverance.

I'm [not sure that the Swedish government is doing what it should at this point](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/catastrophe-sweden-coronavirus-stoicism-lockdown-europe), but all I know is that we will prevail.

At least, if we won't, I enjoy the thought of [animals taking Earth back](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/animals-cities-coronavirus-lockdowns-deer-raccoons).

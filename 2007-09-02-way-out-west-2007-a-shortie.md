This post was really meant to be a fierce tribute to the success that was [Way Out West](http://wayoutwest.se), the Swedish music festival of 2007 ((Yes, I am aware that 2007 isn't quite over yet, but unless aliens land on my doorstep carrying The Smiths and Einstürzende Neubauten from the year 1986 with them while proclaiming my apartment a festival, I think it's safe to say Way Out West kicks every other festival in Sweden (that I've been to).)), but as I've procrastinated that for far too long, I'll give you this link to [X's post on the subject](http://cyndamoore.wordpress.com/2007/08/30/way-out-west-2007). After all, we loved the same bands and actually ranked our fave gigs the same.

I was really happy to have seen [Voxtrot](http://www.voxtrot.net), especially as [they chickened out](https://niklasblog.com/?p=1322) playing Pop Dakar yesterday. Mitch, Jared and Ramesh were all really nice, and I'm still holding Ramesh to his word on them playing "Every Day" the first time they show up in Stockholm. I've promised them a round of alcohol, and as all musicians are addicted to drugs, sex and alcohol you know they're going to show. If you want to see a video of Voxtrot playing "Your Biggest Fan" at Way Out West and wreck your speakers due to the incredibly bad sound-quality, click [here](http://youtube.com/watch?v=Cic5pGox7LA). The drunkard teens on site had no clue what this band was on about, which Ramesh later commented to X and me as "awkward". True that. Anyway, I can't really describe the feeling of seeing Voxtrot live. I've listened their EP's, singles and album to pieces and they're truly one of the best, modern bands out there with a unique voice. I sincerely hope they come to Sweden in November as planned.

[The Go! Team](http://www.thegoteam.co.uk) were brilliant; even though their new album is basically more of the same old, they've got a few new hits, of which "[Do It Alright](http://youtube.com/watch?v=p_LoSqyNmeo)" is the best. They bounced about more (and were a lot more sober) than [...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead](http://www.trailofdead.com) and wielded blazing renditions of stuff like "Junior Kickstart" and "Ladyflash".

The people who arranged the festival really outdid themselves. In comparison, Accelerator was blown away. Things like projections of birds onto trees, good mats laid out in the big tent to make sure people didn't slip in the mud or wet grass were really appreciated. I liked the fact that there were merely a few places where you could buy stuff, preventing the entrance to become cluttered. Nice.

[Regina Spektor](http://www.reginaspektor.com) was really nice to hear. I haven't really been into her music, but this time around I'll buy her latest album. She's apparently a Soviet expat who's made her day in the USA, creating music that's affiliated - but _not_ akin - with that of piano-player and singer [Diamanda Galà¡s](http://www.diamandagalas.com). I think people who compare her with Tori Amos ought to have their head examined and start listening to more music. Regina had heart, wonderful sense of experimentation, humor and good songs.

[Primal Scream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primal_Scream) were old. They're one of my favourite artists, and even though I haven't seen them live before, I'd say it's still worth it. X and I were continually ousted from our positions by a semi-elderly lady who seemed intent of talking rubbish ((Among other things, about how she's used to dancing to The Pogues and Creedence Clearwater Revival.)) to anybody who'd listen. She kept waving her arms in the air during "Rocks" and "Jailbird", but when the Primals hit with "[Swastika Eyes](http://www.lyricsdir.com/primal-scream-swastika-eyes-lyrics.html)" - basically a fast electro-track - she looked as if she were 5 years old and had been forgotten by the roadside by her parents, en route to Spain.

The band played their wonderful anti-track "[Rise](http://www.lyricsdir.com/primal-scream-rise-lyrics.html)", to great effect. Hearing Bobby Gillespie chant "RISE, RISE" over the crowd's head was like a massive compliment to "Swastika Eyes". As X wrote, however, the high came with the low: Mani let us know that Tony Wilson had died, and dedicated "[Damaged](http://www.lyricsdir.com/primal-scream-damaged-lyrics.html)" to him. It was beautiful and horrible. The rain fell and the lyrics, too:

> I'd wake up beside you You'd hold me in your arms Nothing and nobody's gonna do me Any harm oh yeah Said I felt so happy My my my

We made our way back to the hotel after the shows, the days and well, I'll leave this post scathed and unfinished - yet again with a nod to X's post - and I'm already looking forward to the roster for next year's artists. Great work!

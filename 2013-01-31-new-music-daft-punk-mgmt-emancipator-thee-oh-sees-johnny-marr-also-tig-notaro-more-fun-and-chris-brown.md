I haven't written about music in a while, so here goes a wad!

[![MGMT live at Berns](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5043/5238088126_23f536e58f.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/5238088126)

When did Colombia become such a hot label? Well, hot would be the wrong word.

**Daft Punk** have just signed, and they're releasing [their first album in eight years](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/jan/28/daft-punk-to-release-album), come May 2013!

Then there's **MGMT** whose second album, "_Congratulations_", was a massive hit in my mind, who now say [they're getting even more weird for their third album](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/jan/30/mgmt-third-album) which is hopefully out soonish. Am I the only one who thinks "Congratulations" was neither weird or a flop? When I saw them live at Berns in 2010, that was a really good gig. Out came the brats from the posh side of town who were expecting to hear "_Kids_", and instead heard tracks celebrating [Dan Treacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Personalities) and [Brian Eno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno) through a distorted echo-box.

The above cuts are by **[Emancipator](http://www.emancipatormusic.com)** who has made a really good alternative electronic album named "_[Dusk to Dawn](http://locirecords.bandcamp.com/album/dusk-to-dawn)_" that was released on Monday, which kind of...complements Moby's "Play". But better in some ways. Produced well, containing some really good music to work/trip out to. Only 10 USD to download, people!

And then, there's **[Thee Oh Sees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thee_oh_sees)**, who are out with a new album, called "_Floating Coffin_", on 2013-04-16. Yes, that is the album cover above.

**[Johnny Marr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Marr)** is still coming out with his debut solo album, "_The Messenger_", in late February (less than a month away!). [Here](http://entertainment.time.com/2013/01/28/johnny-marr-on-the-smiths-the-messenger-and-going-solo-after-all-these-years/)'s a recent interview which is quite bad in my mind, but his replies are good. Don't miss his clip from TV series "[Portlandia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portlandia_%28TV_series%29)":

Don't miss out on [**Tig Notaro**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tig_Notaro)'s wonderful stand-up album titelled "[Live](http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/oct/19/tig-notaro-reveals-cancer-on-stage)". It's brilliant, and I'm not over-exaggerating shit. 30 minutes of mind-throwing reality.

Let's not forget to end things the way of The Onion, whose perfect headline yesterday read "[**Nation Would Not Be Surprised At This Point If Chris Brown Allegedly Traveled Back In Time And Punched Anne Frank**](http://www.theonion.com/articles/nation-would-not-be-surprised-at-this-point-if-chr,31053)".

**Edit**:

[**The Cave Singers**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cave_Singers) are now a quartet (previously a trio) and will release [a new album](http://boingboing.net/2013/01/31/the-cave-singers-easy-way.html) on 2013-03-05, and [**The Strokes**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strokes) will release [their new album](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/jan/31/strokes-scooped-new-comedown-machine-album).

**Edit 2**:

...and it's such a strong day for record releases; [**Iron and Wine** will debut on Nonesuch Records with "Ghost on Ghost"](http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/iron-and-wine-makes-nonesuch-records-debut-with-new-album-ghost-on-ghost-out-april-16-2013-01-31), 2013-04-16!

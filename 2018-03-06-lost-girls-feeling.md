This two-track, 25-minute 12-inch single is really good. Really good.

It's available for streaming. The first track differs a LOT from the second one, and the first one really differs from...itself after a while. It kind of makes house sound experimental and good again, thank Bog.

Having searched the web, I just discovered that [Lost Girls are made up of Jenny Hval and Håvard Volden](http://thequietus.com/articles/23988-jenny-hval-hvard-volden-lost-girls).

I like that they've taken their name from [the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Melinda Gebbie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Girls).

Here's the second track, sounding as though Burzum's production married Jason Molina's game:

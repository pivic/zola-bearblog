Google have been busy. A couple of days ago, they released Google Desktop 2 in a first English beta version. You'll find info and screen-shots of the deal [here](http://desktop.google.com).

Today Google expanded their empire by revealing a beta version of an instant messenger which communicates through the Jabber-protocol. This means most users who are behind corporate firewalls will not be able to use it, as Jabber runs through TCP port 5222 (when unsecure, as is the only way today - see below). Google have, however, enabled other instant messaging-services, e.g. GAIM and Trillian Pro, the ability to plug into Google Talk. Hence, if you're running one of the by-Google-OK'ed programs you don't have to download their client. One of the biggest advantages with running Google Talk, as I see it, is that users can talk to each-other by voice communication. This functionality doesn't match that of Skype by a long way, but it's a start.

Google [claim they will include the ability to chat and talk encrypted](http://www.google.com/talk/about.html#privacy), but as Google Talk is a beta version at the moment, we'll have to see.

[Alex](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pivic/33432803), one of my dear co-workers, just told me he's going to his first-ever concert. What's he going to partake in? A [Sigur Rà³s](http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk)\-concert! Ever since I first saw [the lovely video for "Svefn-g-englar"](http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/mediaItem.php?id=5), I've liked them. And they're bringing a full-on orchestra with them, so catch them if you can.

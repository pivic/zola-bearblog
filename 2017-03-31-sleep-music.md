Slept for a bunch of hours in a row last night without waking up. Can't express how good that felt.

Now: riding the train to work, listening to Body Count's latest album - speedy rap/thrash - while starting to read Fuminori Nakamura's "_The Thief_".

https://youtu.be/hlk7o5T56iw OK, I must admit, hearing Body Count do their own version of Slayer's "_Raining Blood"_ is cute and pathetic at the same time. Why is that almost only applicable to metal?

Zzz.

OK, now it's time to sleep standing up while listening to one of the best psych bands in a long time, Manchester's very fine **Gnod.** And by that way, check out their latest album cover, which displays the album title quite nicely:

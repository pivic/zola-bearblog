Yesterday, Mikaela and I went to [Heron City](http://www.heroncity.se) ( a large entertainment complex which is basically very big and much like a cave, sans a lot of shops) and saw "[Collateral](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2004-11-16-collateral.jpg)". I sort of liked [it](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369339), it feels good to see that big American are somewhat getting away from the stale, old format of Arnold Schwarzenegger/Jerry Bruckheimer type of action films where everything's constantly blown up, every single foreigner is automatically evil and women are just idiots. Anyway, it's better than most action films but yet slightly disappointing. It felt like they rounded a few edges not to make Tom Cruise's character too questioning or too opinionated, so his Brad Pitt-off-Fight-Club psychobabble felt a bit like it was swiped off the comment pages of "Wallpaper".

Oh, my computer at work is dying. Or rather, Internet Explorer has, so I have to reinstall it. A repair won't work. I've tried to reinstall WinXP SP2, but every time I try to kick IE into action, it says "user.dll" crashes it. I carnt be bothered. I must reinstall the computer, but I have no will to do it. Why, Gawd, whyyy? Well, time to get my sorry forces in order to go get lunch and find some decalcifying and cleaning agents for our espresso machine. Life is so cruel, erhmph.

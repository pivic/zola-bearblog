**[Glenn Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Gould)** was a real mothaphukkin' G.

He played the piano masterfully. Check him playing the shit out of this part of Bach's _[Goldberg Variations, BWV 988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldberg_Variations)_:

Check out "Genius Within", a brilliant documentary on Gould:

Go to 13:10 in that film and see his former friend and co-trainee showing the "detached finger technique" that [Alberto Guerrero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Guerrero) taught Gould and his students.

Gould was God.

I'm currently reading Quentin Crisp's radiant autobiography, "[The Naked Civil Servant](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1134393.Naked_Civil_Servant)", which I strongly recommend. Here's an example of purloined wit.

> After a while this mixture was enriched by a touch of social realism. A coloured gentleman was added. The announcement of his arrival was made with a flourish to the inner circle as we sat in the basement awaiting our scrambled-egg supper.
> 
> **Landlord**: I want you all to know that there is a coal-black Negro living at the top of the house. **Lodger**: Oh dear! And there's no lock on my door. **Landlord**: In that case, Mrs Thomas, you will have to think of some other method of preventing his escape.

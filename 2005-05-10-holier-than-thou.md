When I came home from work today, our apartment door was open, and somebody was inside, using an industrial type hoover. I entered the apartment, thinking that some dust had probably accumulated inside our bathroom, due to our upstairs neighbour having his bathroom completely renovated. Hell no. When I entered, Mikaela was to the left, and some handiman was to the right, hoovering away.

[![](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-05-10-notethumb.jpg)](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/2005-05-10-note.jpg)Mikaela quickly told me the persons responsible for the renovations had dropped this frikkin' note in our mail-slot just as Mikaela came home. The contents of this note reads as follows:

> Hello!
> 
> We apologise for the hole in your ceiling in your bathroom and that we to dirty \[sic\] it. We tried getting hold of key \[sic\] in order to get in and clean there but nobody had it. Please call me at \[phone number\]. We are here from 07.00 - 18.00. All the best Jonas

Did [Vicky Pollard](http://www.littlebritain.tv/characters_vicky.htm) leave that note?

They'd bloody goatse'd our roof!

The person who obviously did this, the same one who hoovered bits of damage off our entire bathroom, sheepishly said "I'll ask the guy who does the tiling to fix, eh, this as soon as possible, eh."

When the drill came crashing through our ceiling, it carried water. Concrete dust and water, slung at high speeds, hit the walls in our bathroom as if Jackson Pollock was finishing a masterpiece. Braaah!, as Missy Elliott would have said.

[Here](https://niklasblog.com/bilder/2005-05-10) are a few pictures left on the digital camera for some weird reason. Note the receipt from 1994, when I bought my next-to-latest computer, a PII 450MHz machine, with a monitor, for 8300SKR. That's appx. 1000USD.

First, [an entire downloadable album](http://halley.lunarpages.com/~djbc002/beastles) of Beatles with Beastie Boys, DL and have fun.

[Here's a veritable essay](http://www.directcreative.com/aaexperiments.html) on people having fun with sending various items by snail mail just to see if, and what happens when, they reach their intended destination.

Was David Hockney, the artist who said a lot of artists in the 18th century used optics to paint the most mind-boggling images, correct or wrong? [This guy says](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6868) he's all wrong. Very interesting.

[Here is a little lesson](http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/story.jsp?story=601481) for y'all not to go Scooby-Dooing around! A woman who tried to haunt her husband's employer into leaving his castle.

Looking for cheap CD's or DVD's? Looks like [this company](http://wesellcd.com) sells 'em cheap; at least if you're living in Scandinavia.

If you're Swedish, check out [this little coffee-guide](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=631&a=225573&maNo=1). Frederic went to Alfons coffeeshop today, and said their caffe latte was superior.

Google has just released [Picasa](http://www.picasa.com) in version 2. This is their _free_ photo-sharing and -editing tool. Looks very nice! I've so far created a screen-saver, a slideshow (which the program burned to CD for me), a web gallery and sorted my entire picture library using it. Looks great so far.

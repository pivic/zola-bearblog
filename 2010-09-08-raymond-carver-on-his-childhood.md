What was your early life like, and what made you want to write?

**[RAYMOND CARVER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond%20Carver)**

I grew up in a small town in eastern Washington, a place called [Yakima](http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&iwloc=addr&f=q&ll=46.6020711%2C-120.5058987&hl=en&z=13&ie=UTF8). My dad worked at the sawmill there. He was a saw filer and helped take care of the saws that were used to cut and plane the logs.

My mother worked as a retail clerk or a waitress or else stayed at home, but she didn't keep any job for very long. I remember talk concerning her "nerves." In the cabinet under the kitchen sink, she kept a bottle of patent "nerve medicine," and she'd take a couple of tablespoons of this every morning. My dad's nerve medicine was whiskey. Most often he kept a bottle of it under that same sink, or else outside in the woodshed.

I remember sneaking a taste of it once and hating it, and wondering how anybody could drink the stuff. Home was a little two-bedroom house. We moved a lot when I was a kid, but it was always into another little two-bedroom house. The first house I can remember living in, near the fairgrounds in Yakima, had an outdoor toilet. This was in the late 1940s. I was eight or ten years old then. I used to wait at the bus stop for my dad to come home from work. Usually he was as regular as clockwork. But every two weeks or so, he wouldn't be on the bus. I'd stick around then and wait for the next bus, but I already knew he wasn't going to be on that one, either. When this happened, it meant he'd gone drinking with friends of his from the sawmill. I still remember the sense of doom and hopelessness that hung over the supper table when my mother and I and my kid brother sat down to eat.

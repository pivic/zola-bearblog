Even though the interview with [Graham Greene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%20Greene) was slightly disappointing and the one with [William Faulkner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Faulkner) showed him as quite arrogant - despite his writing being hailed by virtually every other author interviewed from the 1950s to the 1980s - there were quite a few eye-openers here.

[Isaac Bashevis Singer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac%20Bashevis%20Singer)'s very subtle and very welcoming manners definitely lured me to examine his writing, and his view on forthcoming technology was definitely enough to have me drawn in.

[Gabriel Garcà­a Mà¡rquez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%20Garc%C3%ADa%20M%C3%A1rquez) was also quite humble, and made me wish to delve into his writing.

Speaking of which, a bunch of the authors in this volume refer to his "magical realism", a term I haven't come to grips with; other writers are also mentioned to adhere to this type of writing.

[Philip Larkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip%20Larkin), refusing to be interviewed in person, is here in print for one of the very few times he's been interviewed at all. He's witty, funny and very staunch. I love the way he views things, apart from how he dislikes modernism and thinks one jazz-musician killed jazz for all future. Still, Larkin didn't want to be named Poet Laureate for which I will always revere him, not to mention his style of writing and poems.

[Harold Bloom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold%20Bloom) and [Toni Morrison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni%20Morrison) both added inspiration and insight, but [William Gaddis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Gaddis) infused me with nothing. [Alice Munro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%20Munro) seems frank and easy-going, and [Stephen King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen%20King) is...slighted by [Stanley Kubrick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley%20kubrick), as always.

All in all: a very recommendable volume. Can't wait to get into the others!

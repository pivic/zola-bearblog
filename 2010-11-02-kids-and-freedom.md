A lobbyist conversation between three people in [Jonathan Franzen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Franzen)'s novel "_[Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_(Franzen_novel))_" puts the matter of children into perspective:

> "Listen, Richard," Walter said. "The conservatives won. They turned the Democrats into a center-right party. They got the entire country singing "God Bless America," stress on _God_, at every single major-league baseball game. They won on every rucking front, but they especially won culturally, and _especially_ regarding babies. In 1970 it was cool to care about the planet's future and not have kids. Now the one thing everyone agrees on, right and left, is that it's beautiful to have a lot of babies. The more the better. Kate Winslet is pregnant, hooray hooray. Some dimwit in Iowa just had octuplets, hooray hooray. The conversation about the idiocy of SUVs stops dead the minute people say they're buying them to protect their precious babies."
> 
> "A dead baby's not a pretty thing," Katz said. "I mean, presumably you guys aren't advocating infanticide."
> 
> "Of course not," Walter said. "We just want to make having babies more of an embarrassment. Like smoking's an embarrassment. Like being obese is an embarrassment. Like driving an Escalade would be an embarrassment if it weren't for the kiddie argument. Like living in a four-thousand-square-foot house on a two-acre lot should be an embarrassment."

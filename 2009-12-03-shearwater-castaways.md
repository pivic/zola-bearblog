[The boys](http://www.matadorrecords.com/shearwater/) are already queuing the release of their new album, "**The Golden Archipelago**", with a free download! Apart from being available as a single MP3 in 192Kbps, it's available in lossless heavenly [FLAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Lossless_Audio_Codec "Free Lossless Audio Codec"), with single artwork and "dossier pages" to boot! Here's the coming album cover:

Here's the track:

\[audio:http://www.matadorrecords.com/mpeg/shearwater/shearwater\_castaways.mp3\]

The extravagant stuff you get when purchasing the album:

> The CD comes packaged with a 50-page perfect-bound book that is a set of extracts from a dossier of records, photos, regulations and images collected by Shearwater's [Jonathan Meiburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Meiburg "Jonathan Meiburg"). The LP contains 2 bonus tracks & an MP3 download coupon (that includes the album + PDF of the dossier). (Note: LP pre-orders will ALSO receive a copy of the CD-sized perfect bound book.)
> 
> Serious researchers will have a way to obtain the actual, full-sized, full-color 73-page dossier in its special envelope ““ this will be announced soon, so keep your eyes on this space.

"This space" being, of course, [Shearwater's page at Matador](http://www.matadorrecords.com/shearwater/).

Enjoy the track, I know I will continue to for some time; it's absolute lovely with Jonathan's high notes and the foreground drums and bass hitting home instantly. These guys know their sound well. The song sounds hollow in some way, and I can't help thinking of Talk Talk here, the English 80s band that Shearwater covered when doing "_[The Rainbow](http://www.prefixmag.com/news/shearwater-the-rainbow-talk-talk-cover-mp3/18778/)_". Still, the synths and the guitars in tune with the piano...lovely, I know I said it. Still, this is like coming home in a very good sense of the word. ((Gotta find those bird references, quick!))

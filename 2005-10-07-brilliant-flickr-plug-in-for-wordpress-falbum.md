I've just found the best flickr plug-in for WordPress: [FAlbum](http://www.randombyte.net/blog/projects/falbum). It took me two minutes to set up. Easy.

Now, check my album page out on the sidebar. It's called [my flickr pics](https://niklasblog.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php).

And for those of you who wonder: yeah, I'm still thinking about gallery possibilities. I like the idea of hosting my own pictures so that I don't have to deal with eventualities, i.e. what happens if flickr goes belly-up and my pictures on their servers vanish? Today, my [Gallery](https://niklasblog.com/gallery2) is on a server in the USA. This means that if _they_ would go belly-up I can't get _those_ pictures. So anyway, I'm thinking about going flickr all the way, using a pro account and the FAlbum plug-in I've just mentioned. I still have my pictures stored on my hard-drives and am backing them up once a month (in case the drives crash). I'm still posting pictures to both these picture-places of mine, so don't stop using either. Because I know you check them every three minutes. My fans. So loyal.
